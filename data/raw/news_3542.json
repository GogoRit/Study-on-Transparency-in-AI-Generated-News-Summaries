(photo: Katie Yoder / CNA)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nInterviews\nNovember 20, 2022\n\n\nBishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia, was elected on Nov. 16 to serve as chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities, because its former chairman, Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, was elected to serve instead as vice president of the conference. \nBishop Burbidge, 65, has served previously within the conference as chairman of the bishops\u2019 Committee on Communication and has been vocal on pro-life issues in the past. He spoke with the Register following his election about his vision for pro-life outreach and how to address the scandal of pro-abortion Catholic politicians. \n \nIn this post-Dobbs climate, what do you see as some priorities for the committee, and what do you foresee as some challenges? \nThe priorities will be the same: continuing the great work that Archbishop Lori, our new vice president of the conference, has done, consistent with advocacy, witnessing on behalf of human life, and also service on behalf of human life. While we celebrate the overturning of Roe v. Wade \u2014 it\u2019s a great pro-life victory \u2014 I\u2019m so mindful of those who, for all these years \u2014 many have gone home to God \u2014 but for many years prayed for that day when we would see that overturned. God used their patience, their perseverance, their witness in a miraculous way. \nOur work is not any less because we know the focus is now changed to the states, and we have a lot of work to do in education, even among our own faithful, to know that this work of protecting life is at a very critical time, where we\u2019re seeing laws in various states \u2014 referenda being proposed that are extreme, with no restrictions, and federal funding of abortion.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of work to do to educate the faithful about what is going on, not only on the federal level, but on the state level, and then to inspire them to bring their faith into the public arena. And that\u2019s by engaging their elected officials, peacefully witnessing in state marches on behalf of human life, and continuing our very pro-life initiatives and efforts of serving life. Mothers who are in crisis pregnancies or parents who are struggling with finances or the basic necessities for children, we\u2019re here to help to serve, to walk with mothers and fathers. So all those things are our priorities now. \n \nWe have a president who describes himself as Catholic but advances legal abortion. What are your thoughts on addressing the confusion that causes? \nWe have to be continually clear on the teachings of our Catholic Church, and we can\u2019t allow anyone, especially in the public arena, including elected officials, to serve as if they\u2019re the teachers when they put themselves forward as a Catholic and act contrary, in complete opposition to what we have always held to be true and will always hold true. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t change the Gospel: All of human life is from God as sacred and must be protected. We must continue to be very clear in our teachings and try to make sure that we do our part to prevent the faithful from being scandalized when people in any field publicly assert being a Catholic and then say something that\u2019s completely contradictory of what it means to uphold the gospel of life. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to continue to do consistently. \n \nMany politicians, following the overturning of Roe, have become more adamant in their pro-abortion efforts and still present themselves for Communion. How do the bishops address that? \nThat\u2019s the role of a bishop; that\u2019s the role of a teacher: to engage public officials who profess to be Catholic and then act contrarily. It\u2019s our obligation to engage them and to speak with them and try our best to transform their hearts; and that means a willingness to meet with them, to dialogue with them, and also to encourage them to really be consistent in what we profess as a Catholic and to live that faith. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can never tire of engaging. We never count out the power of the Lord and the Spirit of God to transform hearts.  \n \nArchbishop Lori outlined a vision of \u201cradical solidarity\u201d with moms in need, recognizing a belonging to one another on this issue. I wanted to ask you your thoughts on that vision. \nRadical solidarity, that\u2019s a great term, but it\u2019s not just a term. It\u2019s who we are, and it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve been so inspired these last two days, and I hope our Catholic faithful know this. I think our Catholics will be so very proud of their Church and what we are doing as a conference of bishops and as dioceses and parishes across the country. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe last two days we heard, for example, reports from Catholic Charities USA and the countless number of people who have been assisted through Catholic Charities USA. We heard from CLINIC [Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc.], which is helping provide legal representation to our brothers and sisters who are immigrants to our country. I had the great privilege of speaking on the National Catholic Partnership on Disability, to be referring to what we are doing to make sure people with intellectual, developmental, physical disabilities are fully engaged and included in our parishes and our schools and our faith-formation programs. We heard from the Ukrainian archbishop of what we have done as a Church in the United States to help people, our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, who are going through so much suffering. We heard from Catholic Relief Services on all that is going on to help people, brothers and sisters from around our world. So this solidarity is being lived out in extremely generous ways. Why? We\u2019re pro-life, and we uplift the sacredness of life and the dignity of every human person.  \nWe can only do this because the faithful are so generous to these important life ministries. But it\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s what we believe, and it\u2019s consistent. It\u2019s consistent from the very first moment of conception to natural death. \n \nYou see the pro-life issue as connected to other issues, correct? \nOf course, absolutely. I\u2019m the episcopal liaison for persons with disabilities, but that\u2019s pro-life, right? And everything and every other person standing up there today and talking about the great ministry work: It\u2019s pro-life. That\u2019s who we are.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the violent protests, the vandalism of churches, the extreme anger and hostility in the wake of the overturning of Roe? How can pro-lifers respond to that? \nIt\u2019s very unsettling when you know you are a target of anger and especially against that which is sacred, and we\u2019ve seen that. It\u2019s a very clear reminder of not only the division, but the hatred, that leads to violence that\u2019s so present in our world. But at all times we\u2019re Christians, and so we can only respond to acts of violence with a willingness to certainly not accept that \u2014 we can\u2019t accept that, but not with more violence. When we see hatred, we have to match it with love; when we see confusion and division, we have to be peacemakers and unifiers. \nSo we radically live the Gospel when we denounce any form of targeting against people because of their religious beliefs and morally held convictions. We have to denounce that that\u2019s unacceptable, but the way we respond to it is always with love, just as the Lord did himself. \n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on engaging young people on the pro-life issue? \nThey all see in their own families, whether it\u2019s a brother or a sister or another family member, the joy when a new family member comes into the family, a new child is born. We all rejoice in that because it\u2019s one of the most beautiful gifts that God has given to us.\nWe have to educate that the attack on life is taking innocent lives and is now going to an extreme. I think that in their heart of hearts, so many of our young people, they don\u2019t want to see the violence that comes to the child within the womb. I think we have to continue to educate on what is at stake here.  \nWe want to make sure that every mother, every father knows that they\u2019re never walking alone, that we\u2019re walking with them. We don't want them to be afraid. We want to be there for them; and if they\u2019re having difficulties with finances, we want to be there to help them. If they need counseling, we want to be here to help them. If they can\u2019t afford medical care, we want to be there to provide the medical care, so abortion does not have to be the answer \u2014 because that\u2019s going to lead to more hurt in their lives and damage. \n\n\n\n\n\nI think if you invite young people to help us, to say, \u201cHelp us to walk with parents so they don\u2019t need to choose an abortion \u2014 be part of that effort,\u201d I think we can do a better job of inviting our young adults to help to us give parents every reason to choose life and to make abortion unthinkable. I know when we invite our young adults to serve, they come forward. And when we can say, \u201cListen, you know so many lives are going to be saved if parents are assured that they\u2019re going to have the care and the necessities, all they need. Why don\u2019t we be part of that solution?\u201d \nI feel if we just increase our efforts of inviting, it could be part of the solution. \n\n\nKeywords: \nbishop michael burbidge\nu.s. bishops\nprolife witnesses\nchurch teaching on the dignity of life\nlauretta brown\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop Burbidge Elected to Pro-Life Chair;
