On the first day of the Nebraska Unicameral\u2019s legislative session, state Sen. Suzanne Geist introduced a bill that would ban a common procedure used for second-trimester abortions.\nThe bill, introduced Jan. 8, seeks to ban dilation and evacuation abortions, or \u201cdismemberment abortions\u201d as the bill calls them.\n\u201cDismemberment abortion means an abortion in which, with the purpose of causing the death of an unborn child, a person purposely dismembers the body of a living unborn child and extracts him or her one piece at a time from the uterus through use of clamps, grasping forceps, tongs, scissors, or similar instruments that, through the convergence of two rigid levers, slice, crush, or grasp a portion of the unborn child\u2019s body to cut or rip it off,\u201d the bill says.\nThe bill would make an exception for cases in which the mother\u2019s life is at risk by continuing a pregnancy, or for cases in which a physician determines there is \u201cserious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function\u201d should the mother continue a pregnancy.\nOnly doctors performing dismemberment abortions would face sanctions under the bill; it would not seek to punish women seeking or undergoing the procedure, or any staff assisting the physician, including nurses or pharmacists.\n\u201cRegardless of our individual opinions on the issue of abortion, I think we can all agree that no living human being should be torn apart limb by limb,\u201d Geist said at a Jan. 8 press conference, NET News reported.\nThe bill comes at a time when several other states have passed or introduced bills that restrict abortion in some way, while other states are scrambling to expand access to abortion, in anticipation of a possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the U.S.\nSome bills restricting abortion have passed state legislatures, but have been blocked in court.\nGeist has said she is not concerned about judicial appeals of the bill.\n\u201cMy job is to legislate, not to worry about what the courts are going to do,\u201d the state senator told NET News.\nMarion Miner, on behalf of the Nebraska Catholic Conference, shared the conference\u2019s enthusiastic support.\n\u201cWe are eager to see this law passed,\u201d he said, \u201cand confident in its constitutionality. It protects unborn children from having to endure a particularly brutal procedure, protects the integrity of the medical profession, and prevents the deterioration of society\u2019s understanding of the value of human life, much as the federal partial birth abortion ban of 2003 sought to do, and which was upheld by the Supreme Court in the Gonzales case in 2007.\n\u201cDismemberment of living unborn children is deeply wrong,\u201d he continued, \u201cand in Nebraska, which has always prided itself for laws that demonstrate our value for human life, there is no reason it should still be happening. We stand behind Sen. Geist and commend the effort to end this dehumanizing practice.\u201d\nThe bill was introduced on the same day that Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts declared the anniversary of Roe v. Wade as a day of prayer for the state of Nebraska.\n\u201cNebraska state law states that it is \u2018the will of the people of the State of Nebraska and the members of the Legislature to provide protection for the life of the unborn child whenever possible,\u2019\u201d Ricketts said in a proclamation.\n\u201cNebraskans display our pro-life values in a multitude of ways from the crisis pregnancy centers that provide free care for expecting parents to the prayer vigils held across the state every year.\u201d\nThe governor encouraged Nebraskans to pray according to their own faith tradition for an end to abortion, as well as to \u201ctake direct action to aid mothers, fathers and families in need, especially those expecting a child who cannot provide for themselves.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular Diocesan News\n\n\nParish asking Lord for a miracle\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t01-19-2024\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nChampioning faith: A Catholic wrestler\u2019s journey\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t03-08-2024\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nHoly Trinity Parish: A year of faith, strength, support in the face of cancer\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12-22-2023\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAsk the Register: do we go to Mass twice?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12-15-2023\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nOpportunity Scholarships  of Nebraska launches website, gives hope to Nebraska families\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12-08-2023\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMsgr.
