He recited praise for the size of the crowd, bragged about the number of federal judges he has appointed, and attacked Democrats over social policy.Trump also appeared to make a reference to impeachment by telling abortion opponents:\u00a0\"They are coming after me because I am fighting for you.\"In his speech at the rally, Trump made a special appeal to women, saying they are using the power of \"their votes\" to fight abortion.Following his remarks, the audience responded with chants of \"four more years.\"\u00a0Rachel Maneval, 22, a veterinary assistant, has been marching with her parents since she was a child. She saidTrump\u2019s appearance as the march was \u201cencouraging\u201d for her and for the anti-abortion movement. She was wearing a Trump 2020 hat.\u201cI hope that people see that it\u2019s for love, not for hatred and disgust,\u201d she said.In an apparent nod to the powerful impact of\u00a0women\u00a0voters in the last two elections, the\u00a0theme for the gathering in this contentious election year is \"Life Empower: Pro-life is Pro-Woman.\"The march is the centerpiece\u00a0for\u00a0three days of activities that include\u00a0a youth rally,\u00a0a Christian rock concert and an expo featuring anti-abortion\u00a0organizations and ministries.One participant, Frances Floresca, 23, a recent graduate of the University of Utah, called the March for Life \u201cthe real Women\u2019s March.\u201d She was wearing a beanie that said \u201cLove them both.\u201d\u201cWe are fighting for women and babies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re standing for the women who need to be strong so they don\u2019t get an abortion.\u201d\u00a0Both Patricia Carroll, 60, and Bonita Ravolt, 78, arrived from Chicago to attend the March for Life for the third time.Ravolt, a retired registered nurse, told USA TODAY that she\u2019s spent the last 25 years protesting against abortion.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so proud to be here, and see all these beautiful mothers and beautiful fathers,\u201d she said.The annual event began in 1974\u00a0when a small group of anti-abortion activists, who were trying to lobby\u00a0Congress over the issue,\u00a0sought to draw attention to the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade\u00a0ruling that\u00a0declared unduly restrictive state regulation of abortion\u00a0unconstitutional.Carroll, who works at American Airlines, said she was in the eight grade at the time of the Supreme Court ruling and has\u00a0been against it since then.\u201cMy mother was very pro-life, and it was always instilled with me how wrong that law was,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until abortion becomes unthinkable,\u201d she added, mirroring the term used frequently by speakers and March for Life organizers.This year is a critical one for both the abortion rights\u00a0and anti-abortion forces\u00a0as the Supreme Court relitigates a 2016 ruling\u00a0that\u00a0made it harder to get abortions in Texas.The high court will likely rule on a similar law in Louisiana, requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.Trump's appearance is particularly striking since\u00a0past president's who supported anti-abortion views did so more\u00a0at a distance. Both\u00a0Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush steered clear of a personal appearance at the annual march, preferring instead to send\u00a0remarks for others to deliver, speak via telephone or invite\u00a0organizers to visit the White House.Last year, Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, made a surprise appearance at the march.\u00a0\"We've got a record of extraordinary progress on the right to life,\" Pence said of the Trump administration. \"This will be the generation that restores the right to life in America.\"He later touted the administration's nomination of conservative judges and allowing \"states to defund Planned Parenthood.\"\u00a0In staking out a higher profile at the event this year, Trump underscores his steady wooing of white evangelical leaders and voters.\u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant move,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of Trump\u2019s most prominent evangelical supporters. Reed said the president\u2019s appearance would \u201cenergize and remind pro-life voters what a great friend this president and administration has been.\u201dMarch for Life:Trump to join fired-up crowds as anti-abortion laws face court challengesHours before Trump's address, his re-election campaign announced creation of a \"Pro-Life Voices for Trump\" coalition. It will be \"dedicated to recruiting and activating Americans with pro-life values in support of President Trump\u2019s\u00a0re-election,\" the campaign said in a statement.Democratic opponents said a second term for Trump will mean the end of the Roe vs. Wade ruling establishing abortion rights.\"The Trump administration and Republicans are actively taking away a woman\u2019s constitutional right to make her own reproductive healthcare decisions,\" tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"We must keep up the fight to protect Roe and access to care.\"Trump's anti-abortion position marks\u00a0a sharp reversal for the free-wheeling New York developer who\u00a0described himself as \"very pro-choice\" in a 1999 appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"During the 2016 campaign for the GOP nomination, Trump said his views on abortion had changed\u00a0and that he was now anti-abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother\u00a0is at risk.Over the last 10 years, the Republican Party has undergone a \u201crevolution,\u201d displaying a new willingness to \u201cembrace the issue as not only being morally right but politically smart,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PAC. The group is planning to spend $52 million this cycle to help elect candidates opposed to abortion rights. Its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, will serve as national co-chair of a new campaign coalition, \u201cPro-life Voices for Trump.\u201dLast year alone,\u00a058 anti-abortion laws were passed, including 25 that\u00a0banned\u00a0the procedure to some extent, according to the Guttmacher Institute,\u00a0a research organization that supports reproductive rights. Further, the number of abortions performed in the United States reached an all-time low.\u00a0Contributing: Nicquel Terry Ellis, USA TODAY; Associated PressFeatured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
