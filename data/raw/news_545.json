Not politics. As a physician who provides abortion care to my patients\u00a0I believe medical knowledge and compassion for each patient\u2019s individual circumstances\u00a0\u2013\u00a0not politics \u2013 should guide decisions about access to abortion care.But once again\u00a0politicians in Tallahassee are trying to insert themselves in the exam room between patients and their trusted physicians. These misguided politicians are again working to impose restrictions on the gestational age at which a woman can make the personal decision to end a pregnancy. These restrictions often affect patients at a time in their lives that are among their most difficult, which makes these restrictions not only medically unsafe but also cruel to the families they affect.\u00a0\u00a0Politicians don\u2019t know the stories of the individual patients they are hurting with these restrictions. They don\u2019t sit with them and hold their hands as they struggle to do the right thing by their families and their faith. I do. I know these families. I know their stories and their struggles. And I know they won\u2019t be served by this dangerous and hurtful law.\u00a0I recently had a patient \u2013 with a planned and wanted pregnancy \u2013 who was diagnosed at 21 weeks with pulmonary hypoplasia due to renal agenesis. What this means is that once her\u00a0baby was delivered he would be unable to breath air and would suffocate to death. I ask you:\u00a0Who would be served by forcing a woman and her family in this terrible situation to carry her pregnancy to term?\u00a0I can tell you that this patient didn\u2019t consider herself \u201cpro choice\u201d until she went through this experience and came to understand firsthand that every situation, every pregnancy is different. I met with a state senator who had signed on as a sponsor of a 20-week abortion ban that year. My patient was one of his constituents. When I told him this story he acknowledged that he really didn\u2019t understand the potential implications of what he was supporting. The bill failed that year and I hope it will again this year.Recently\u00a0women from around the country who had abortions later in pregnancy spoke out against the abortion ban bill currently being considered in Florida \u2013 Senate Bill 744 and House Bill 351.\u00a0Dana Peirce from Yarmouth, Maine, is a wife and a mother of two living children. In 2019\u00a0\u2013 32 weeks into what had been a normal pregnancy \u2013 she and her family went to what they expected to be a routine ultrasound.That\u2019s when they found out their son, Cameron, had lethal skeletal dysplasia. This is another condition that causes babies to be unable to breath outside the womb; their rib cages are too small and leave no room for their lungs to expand. Cameron also had a broken femur and evidence of other healed fractures.Dana\u2019s son was suffering and would only continue to suffer until he was born \u2013 at which point he would have suffocated to death. Dana and her husband decided that they couldn\u2019t in good conscience allow their son\u2019s needless suffering to continue.They decided to have an abortion but the law wouldn\u2019t allow it in Maine. So\u00a0on top of the trauma of learning their son was actively suffering and wouldn\u2019t survive, they had to embark on a cross-country odyssey to\u00a0Boulder, Colorado, to get the care they needed.Hadleigh Tweedall from Franklin, Tennessee, shared her story about another wanted pregnancy that went tragically wrong.\u201cMultiple specialists told me it was medically impossible for our daughter to survive longer than a few more weeks of pregnancy,\" she said.\u00a0\"Every ounce of excitement and future dream I had about our growing family was taken from me in a matter of minutes.\"Added Tweedall: \"I am a Christian and I believe in miracles, but I also trust modern medicine. I could not stand the thought of my daughter suffering in the one place she should feel safest.\u00a0I could not bond with her longer and watch\u00a0my belly grow\u00a0even bigger, only to say our inevitable goodbye.\u00a0I could not labor for hours to deliver our dead daughter.\u201dAs an OB-GYN\u00a0I hear these stories and see my patients\u2019 distress. I\u2019m not motivated by politics but rather by compassion to address their individual needs and provide\u00a0the best care I can.I urge you to remember these women and others like them. When faced with difficult, often heart-wrenching decisions about pregnancy, these patients deserve understanding and support\u00a0\u2013\u00a0not dangerous and harmful\u00a0legislation that is politically motivated.Dr. Sujatha Prabhakaran is medical director of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, which is based in Sarasota. She\u00a0is an affiliate assistant professor\u00a0in the University of South Florida's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
