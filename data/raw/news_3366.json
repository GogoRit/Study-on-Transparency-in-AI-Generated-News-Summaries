(AP) \u2014 First-of-its-kind Missouri legislation shows that anti-abortion lawmakers in Republican-led states aren\u2019t likely to stop at banning most abortions within their borders but also could try to make it harder to go out of state to end pregnancies.\nA proposal that could be debated in the Legislature as soon as next week seeks to make it illegal to \u201caid or abet\u201d abortions outlawed in Missouri, even if they are performed in other states.\nLike a Texas law passed last year, the bill puts enforcement in the hands of residents, who could file lawsuits against those they believe have violated it.\nREAD MORE: South Dakota lawmakers pass restrictive abortion pill laws under dispute in federal court\nState Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman\u2019s bill is aimed at a key frustration for abortion foes: people crossing state lines to avoid restrictions. The bill also targets a network of 90-plus groups across the U.S. that have sprung up specifically to preserve access to abortion.\nThe proposal comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide by June whether to overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion and GOP-led states rush to pass more restrictions in anticipation that the landmark ruling could be tossed out.\n\u201cIf the court does that, the ability to get an abortion will be on the line for everyone in America, and so we\u2019re at a crisis point,\u201d said Andrew Beck, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. \u201cThe Missouri bill crystallizes that as extreme and dangerous as that crisis is, it\u2019s just the first step in politicians\u2019 effort to outlaw abortions for everyone.\u201d\nMissouri lawmakers in 2019 passed a law banning almost all abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\nUnder Coleman\u2019s measure, anything from driving women across state lines for abortions to internet providers allowing access to certain abortion-related websites would be outlawed. She said St. Louis-area billboards advertising easier-to-get abortions in neighboring Illinois would be banned, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s trying to evade the laws of the state of Missouri,\u201d said Coleman, a St. Louis-area Republican. \u201cAbortion is a really brutal practice and Illinois has chosen not to, in any way, provide protections for the unborn and women, and so we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to make sure Missourians are protected.\u201d\nFor a clinic across the state line from St. Louis, 75% of the patients from September 2021 through February were from Missouri, according to the Planned Parenthood affiliate that operates it.\nIn the Kansas City area, the two clinics performing abortions are on the Kansas side. Missouri residents have traditionally accounted for a large percentage of the abortions performed in Kansas \u2014 42% in 2020, the latest data available.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking it (Coleman\u2019s proposal) seriously because I think if we\u2019ve learned anything from Missouri and also from what\u2019s happened in Texas, it\u2019s that laws that clearly violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights, rights that have been recognized and protected for decades, are now going into effect and impacting whether people can get care,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood affiliate that operates one of those Kansas City clinics.\nColeman\u2019s proposal also would outlaw paying for a woman\u2019s abortion or helping them get insurance coverage to pay for the procedure.\nThe Missouri Abortion Fund provided financial assistance to 1,866 Missouri residents seeking abortions last year \u2014 only two of them in Missouri. Its aid averaged $113, but Michele Landeau, its president, said it helped some people who were only $10 short of being able to pay for their procedures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already so difficult to obtain abortion in Missouri and in a lot of parts of the country, and we don\u2019t need additional threats to people\u2019s lives and people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d Landeau said.\nWhile some legal experts doubt that Coleman\u2019s proposal is constitutional, they also worry that the Supreme Court might refuse to intervene to stop it \u2014 just as it did with the Texas law.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear to these states what they\u2019re going to be able to do, and so I think they\u2019re sort of throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor.\nThe Missouri proposal comes as other Republican-led states consider laws like Texas,\u2019 with Idaho lawmakers passing a similar measure this week.\n\u201cWhile this is the first, it could kick off similar measures elsewhere as states look to adopt more and more outrageous legislation,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy expert for the abortion-rights supporting Guttmacher Institute.\nJohn Seago, legislative director of Texas Right to Life, said women traveling to other states is \u201cgoing to be a reality\u201d if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Since Texas\u2019 six-week ban took effect last year, clinics in neighboring states have reported a sharp increase in the number of patients from that state.\n\u201cThis is something that the pro-life movement has to come to terms with and figure out what really is the proper response,\u201d he said.\nAbortion-rights advocates said regardless of what happens with such laws in the courts, they can create fear or confusion.\n\u201cWe still get calls from Texas \u2026 where they ask, \u2018Is it even legal for me to call you?'\u201d said Zack Gingrich-Gaylord, spokesperson for the abortion-rights group Trust Women, which operates clinics proving abortions in Wichita, Kansas, and Norman, Oklahoma.\nHanna reported from Topeka, Kansas.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A pro-choice demonstrator holds a sign outside the United States Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2021.
