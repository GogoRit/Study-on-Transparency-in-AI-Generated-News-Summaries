Two days earlier, someone had called to cancel her appointment, citing the state\u2019s ban on abortions to preserve medical resources for coronavirus patients. But this time they said they could get her a medication abortion \u2014 which involves taking pills.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Can I come in now?\u2019\u201d Artrip said. \u201cI was scared it would get ripped away.\u201d\nLast month, Gov. Greg Abbott announced an executive order pausing all medical procedures and surgeries that aren\u2019t urgent in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and conserve personal protective equipment. Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly said that the governor\u2019s order should include a ban on most abortions, setting off a legal battle and a barrage of conflicting court rulings that have created confusion for clinics and women seeking to end their pregnancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courts volleyed back and forth this week, siding in turns with the state and then with abortion providers on a question that may ultimately be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Paxton, allowing the near-ban to remain in place. By Thursday, a lower court weighed in to say that medication abortions like Artrip\u2019s \u2014 which do not require personal protective gear \u2014 should still be allowed to proceed. And then on Friday afternoon, the appeals court again sided with the state, but this time allowed for some women who are further along in their pregnancies to undergo abortions even as the prohibition remains in place.\nArtrip was able to get an abortion in the midst of the legal whiplash, but abortion providers across the state are responding inconsistently, with some shutting down altogether while they await a final answer.\n\u201cThis is a nightmare inside of a nightmare,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cOne day patients are called back for their procedures, the next day they are canceled \u2014 all at the whim of Gov. Abbott.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview Friday with the executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, Paxton said he found it \u201ca little shocking\u201d that abortion providers were continuing with their suit against the state.\n\u201cThis is the only group of doctors and providers that have fought it,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting treated any differently. I will admit this is very inconvenient, it's not easy for anybody, but they're saying no, we're special, we don't need to be treated like everybody else, we should be treated better.\u201d\nAbortion rights advocates worry that even as the law is still being settled, Texas GOP officials are effectively cutting off access by scaring women into thinking all abortions are illegal and scaring providers into shutting their doors.\nOn Wednesday, at least one clinic, Austin Women\u2019s Health Center, was still scheduling women for medication abortions, according to an employee who picked up the phone but declined to give her name. By Friday morning, a staffer said the clinic, one of the plaintiffs in the ongoing litigation, was shutting down until they heard back from attorneys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on Friday, an employee who answered the phone at Whole Woman\u2019s Health, another plaintiff in the case, said the clinic is offering medication abortions at its locations in Austin, Fort Worth and McAllen for pregnancies up to 10 weeks gestation.\nStill, several providers across the state were closed both before and after Thursday\u2019s ruling that gave the green light to medication abortions. Many contacted by The Texas Tribune, such as Houston Women\u2019s Clinic and Alamo Women's Reproductive Services in San Antonio, had added temporary voicemails that said they were not offering abortion services due to Abbott\u2019s executive order.\nPersonal protective equipment\nAbortion rights advocates, meanwhile, say clinics should be able to continue providing pill-induced abortions in spite of the ban, which was implemented March 22 and is likely to be extended, because those types of abortions don\u2019t use medical resources cited in the executive order.\n\u201cHe [Paxton] has an interest in presenting that misinformation and letting people believe that all abortion is illegal in Texas now,\u201d said Blake Rocap, legislative counsel at NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, which is not one of the plaintiffs in the case. \u201cAnd reading what the Governor said and what the TMB [Texas Medical Board] has said and what the Fifth Circuit said, that doesn't seem like the case legally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the legal battle, Paxton has argued that the state\u2019s executive order applies to both medication and surgical abortions. In his latest court filing Friday, he again pushed for it to include abortions that involve ingesting pills.\n\u201cRespondents claim that medication abortion consumes little PPE, but, again, all PPE is valuable at this time,\u201d he said in the filing.\nAbbott\u2019s executive order as written exempts procedures that \u201cif performed in accordance with the commonly accepted standard of clinical practice, would not deplete the hospital capacity or the personal protective equipment needed to cope with the COVID-19 disaster.\u201d\nArtrip said her experience was totally contact-free and used \u201czero\u201d personal protective gear. She and the doctor talked through the process over a video call while they sat in neighboring rooms. Then, from behind a bulletproof glass window, she was given a series of pills she would take over the course of 24 hours, along with detailed instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple process,\u201d said Artrip, who had previously shared with the Tribune her struggle to get an appointment.\nDaniel Grossman, an obstetrician-gynecologist, agreed that medication abortions don\u2019t require the scarce medical safety gear.\n\u201cIt is certainly safe and within the standard of care to offer medication abortion without using any personal protective equipment,\u201d said Grossman, who is also an investigator with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, which has been studying the executive order\u2019s impact on abortion access.\nA growing percentage of people obtaining abortions in Texas use medication abortion, those investigators report. The state\u2019s most recent data shows medication abortions accounted for 31.6% of reported abortions among Texas residents in 2017. Procedural abortions, which use more invasive techniques, accounted for more than 60%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in Texas, where patients are legally required to get a sonogram at least 24 hours before the procedure, Grossman said it is still possible to not use protective gear.\nArtrip said she is relieved to have gotten an abortion, but she is angry for the women who cannot access them. Her message to women who are unsure whether they can get an abortion right now: Keep calling clinics.\n\u201cThe legality of it could change at any minute,\u201d she said. \u201cCall every clinic until you find one that can take you, and take the one that can take you the soonest.\u201d\nEmma Platoff contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
