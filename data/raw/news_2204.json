And yet, anti-abortion movements have used foetuses as a primary symbol since the 1970s.AdvertisementFor most of human history, foetuses weren\u2019t actually visible. We didn\u2019t know much about how they evolved in the womb, we only had drawings and wax models based on stillborns, or foetuses preserved in jars of formaldehyde.\u00a0That all changed with Swedish photographer Lennart Nilsson\u2019s book of photography A Child Is Born, which became a global sensation after appearing in Life magazine in 1956. Nilsson captured extreme closeups showing the different stages of human development, from fertilised egg to fully-formed baby.LifeThe Doctor Smoked Throughout My Abortion. I Felt the Whole Procedure.Cristina10.19.20The colour photographs were one of the first representations of the miracle of life, and really gave viewers the impression they were staring directly into the womb, looking at a foetus calmly floating around like a little astronaut. In reality, Nilsson photographed miscarried and aborted foetuses, using artist lighting and planning his subjects' postures.\u00a0The same year Nilsson\u2019s series came out, a hospital in Glasgow used ultrasound technology for foetal screenings for the first time. Now our best tool for checking foetal development before birth, the ultrasound changed prenatal care (and motherhood) forever.\u00a0These scans were more than a medical exam \u2013 they were our earliest \u201cwindow into the womb\u201d, as media studies professor Jos\u00e9 van Dijck wrote in 2001. Before then, only mothers could really know how the pregnancy was developing \u2013 they\u2019d be the first to feel the signs of life, or if something wasn\u2019t right.\u00a0AdvertisementBut since these new exams could only be interpreted by specialists, medical personnel became responsible for directly monitoring the foetus\u2019 well-being, while the mother\u2019s role drifted into the background. \u201cThe same technology that made the foetus visible, has made the mother invisible,\u201d wrote American political scientist Rosalind Pollack Petchesky in an influential 1987 essay.And then, the public window into women\u2019s private domain became political. Before ultrasound technology, anti-abortion activists often relied on religious or moral arguments against safe access to abortions. But the powerful imagery of prenatal scans helped them strengthen their cause \u2013triggering people\u2019s protective instincts towards what looked like a tiny unborn child.\u00a0Still living in Sweden, Nilsson was said to have been shocked when he visited London in the 1980s to find his own images plastered on anti-abortion posters. Realising how the images were being used abroad, he refused to allow them to be published again, until an exhibition shortly before his death.SexWhy I Accompany People to the Abortion ClinicLisa Lotens11.24.20Meanwhile, similar images were being used in the media. In the 1984 film The Silent Scream, which was supposed to be documentary, a doctor shows ultrasounds allegedly depicting a 12-week-old foetus screaming in agony during an abortion. Total pseudo-science, the scene shocked viewers and implied that the pain for the foetus was more important than the pain experienced by women who have to resort to illegal abortions.In her 1987 essay, Petchesky argued the pro-choice movement hadn\u2019t found an image powerful enough to match the foetus as an icon of the anti-abortion movement. According to Christa Compas, director of Humanistisch Verbond \u2013 an NGO based on secular humanistic values \u2013 that remains true today. \u201cI would love it if there was a powerful image in support of the idea that people have the right to choose and shape their own lives,\u201d Compas said in a 2019 interview.The fact that women can die from unsafe abortions clearly hasn\u2019t been enough to stamp out the anti-abortionist movement. Today, feminist movements across the world are going up against imagery that associates abortions with baby-killing. And for pregnant women, the procedure is still often associated with shame and tragedy. But in reality, many women also feel relief and a renewed sense of control after the procedure.
