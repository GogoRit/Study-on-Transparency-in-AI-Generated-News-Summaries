Before 2015, it was common for Uyghurs to have children beyond the state\u2019s limit; however, in July 2017, the family planning policy in Xinjiang changed.\nIn 2016, the National People\u2019s Congress abolished the one-child policy and permitted families to have two children. However, the relaxation of reproductive restrictions excludes ethnic minorities. The report shows that Uyghur women undergo regular pregnancy check-ups and are forced to implant uterine devices and undergo sterilisations and abortions. Experts call this tantamount to \u2018genocide\u2018.\nChina\u2019s forced sterilisation of Uyghur women violates the international human rights treaties to which the People\u2019s Republic of China is a signatory. For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \u201cno person shall be discriminated based on race, color, sex or religion & not be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\u201d Likewise, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination against Women recognises similar condemnations and protections, as does the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Rome Statute Also, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the \u201cRight to life & Right to be Free from Torture, cruel & degrading treatment.\u201d\nMoreover, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has held that preventing birth rates in a particular group through forced sterilisation, abortion, or birth control to influence racial composition is tantamount to genocide. Also, forced sterilisation under the Rome Statute is considered a crime against humanity. Sterilisation without consent is genocide if committed with the intent to destroy a particular group.\nYet in China in particular, the practice violates the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The Declaration urges the international community to enforce women\u2019s reproductive rights as a means of economic and social empowerment by providing appropriate counselling and access to information, privacy, and informed consent. The World Health Organization and Pan-American Health Organization have internationally recognised forced sterilisation as an act of sexual violence against women. In 2017, the\u00a0African Commission on Human and People\u2019s Rights established that female genital mutilation is an act of sexual violence that amounts to inhuman treatment. Therefore, the impropriety of what the Uyghur women face is legally incontrovertible. Forced sterilisation is discriminatory and violates several fundamental rights, such as the right to health, to privacy, and to form a family.\nForced sterilisation often targets multiply-disadvantaged women. In 2018, 80% of new intrauterine device across all of China were implanted in Xinjiang, even though that province consists of only 1.8% of the country\u2019s population. There has been a drastic decline in population growth in Xinjiang. The growth rate in the two provinces with the densest Uyghur population fell by 84% between 2015 and 2018, with a further decline in 2019. By 2020, the Uyghur region has set a zero population growth target. This drastic decline in Xinjiang\u2019s Uyghurs through birth control measures reflects the Chinese government\u2019s ethnic cleansing\nThe Chinese government\u2019s treatment of Uyghur women in concentration camps has continued for years. As the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation\u2019s report makes clear, the Chinese government\u2019s policies require immediate intervention.\nNote: This article gives the views of the authors, and not the position of the Social Policy Blog, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nMohd Ayan\n\n\nThe author's name is Mohd Ayan a second year student of Faculty of Law, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.
