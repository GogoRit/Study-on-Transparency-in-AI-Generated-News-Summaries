Mark Robinson says he paid for abortion in 1989By WITN Web TeamPublished: Mar. 23, 2022 at 10:00 AM EDTShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInRALEIGH, N.C. (WRAL) - North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a hard-line conservative who has long spoken out against abortion, said in a 2012 Facebook comment that he paid for the mother of his \u201cunborn child\u201d to have an abortion in 1989, WRAL is reporting.\u201cI\u2019m not saying abortion is wrong cause I said so it\u2019s wrong cause God says so,\u201d the comment linked to Robinson\u2019s personal Facebook account said. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when others do it and it was wrong when I paid for it to be done to my unborn child in 1989.\u201dRobinson, the highest-ranking state Republican in executive office and an expected gubernatorial candidate, was elected in 2020 on what his campaign calls a \u201cpro-life\u201d platform. Since taking office, he has continued to speak out against abortion at rallies.At an anti-abortion rally in January 2021, Robinson said, \u201cWe allow the murder of the most innocent human beings on earth and we do it with impunity.\u201dAt the North Carolina GOP convention in June, Robinson specifically called on fathers to be involved in their child\u2019s life.\u201cOnce you make a baby, it\u2019s not your body anymore\u2014it\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s body. And, yes, that includes the daddy,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, social media posts resurfaced showing Facebook comments posted by Robinson\u2019s personal Facebook account on Aug. 9, 2012.The comments remained public and live on Robinson\u2019s Facebook page early Wednesday.After multiple requests late Tuesday and early Wednesday, Robinson didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment.Robinson, who gained popularity in conservative circles after a speech about gun rights to the Greensboro City Council in 2018, is known for making controversial statements. In the past year, he has come under fire for comments about the LGBTQ community. Robinson has said abortion should take precedent over other issues.\u201cWe cannot say that \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 or \u2018all lives matter,\u2019 or \u2018blue lives matter\u2019 until we say \u2018unborn lives matter,\u2019 because that\u2019s where we all start,\u201d Robinson said at the January 2021 rally.Robinson includes several details of his personal life under the \u201cpro-life\u201d section of his campaign website.\u201cMark grew up as the 9th of 10 siblings. In poverty, and with an abusive alcoholic father, he ended up in foster care,\u201d the website says.\u201cThe radical left believes stories like [Robinson\u2019s] should not exist because low income families should abort their babies rather than giving them the opportunity to grow up in suboptimal conditions. As a Christian, Mark will honor the sanctity of life,\u201d the website says.The section does not mention any personal experience with an abortion.Copyright 2022 WITN.
