They watched with concern as abortion was gradually accepted in a few states before it became a political issue. As active Catholics the Devlins\u00a0are pro-life, and they saw the pro-life issue as a human justice issue much like the civil rights issue.\n\nPeggy and Bill Devlin/Devlin family\n\n\u00a0\nIn 1970 the couple participated in a walking pilgrimage from Long Island to Albany, New York, stopping along the way to encourage pro-life involvement at local parishes.\u00a0\nPeggy Devlin was removed from the State Assembly for protesting abortion along with a few others, including a rabbi.\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\n\u201cBack then there were a few people drawn to the issue who started parish \u2018human life committees,\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cMembers of the [altar and rosary] society were responding to the threat to unborn life before there was much organization,\u201d Peggy Devlin said, remarking how the U.S. Catholic Church began responding when the national bishops\u2019 conference formed a pro-life office.\nWhen the Supreme Court legalized abortion in the U.S. in 1973, a small group of Long Islanders felt there had to be a dramatic condemnation and voice for life.\u00a0\nBill Devlin and a few others sat around March for Life founder Nellie Gray\u2019s table and came up with the idea of the first national March for Life. A man who owned a bus company, worked with Devlin to coordinate buses from Long Island and parking in Washington D.C. Even without the benefit of the Internet for connecting people, about 20,000 showed up that first year.\n\nThe 1975 March for Life, Bill Devlin at left/Devlin family\n\nAs abortion became a big political issue, Bill Devlin realized that, while politics is the art of compromise, finding the least objectionable way can be dangerous.\n\u201cGenerally partial victory is better than no victory,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not with pro-life. It\u2019s the ultimate category.\u201d\nWhen Bill and Peggy Devlin\u2019s daughter Margaret completed college, she felt called to a vocation with the Sisters of Life, an order of nuns whose mission is the protection and sanctity of life. She entered the novitiate for the order in New York City in 1999.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel and friend/Devlin family\n\nNow having taken the name Sister Mary Gabriel as part of her vocation, she recalls growing up immersed in the love and defense of life.\u00a0\n\u201cMy parents were witnesses of faith, living for something beyond themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey showed us that how we respond to God\u2019s gift of life matters.\u201d\n\u201cThey had a passion for justice,\u201d Sister Mary Gabriel said. \u201cI was in utero at the first March for Life, and our family went every year. We did life chains and my parents tried to enlighten people to public school curriculums and how that could impact young people on human life and sexuality.\u201d\nTweet This: My parents were witnesses of faith, living for something beyond themselves. They showed us that how we respond to God\u2019s gift of life matters\n\u201cI am so grateful for the heroic witness of love that was the fabric of life growing up in our family,\u201d she added. \u201cThe generosity of people defending those they\u2019d never meet, living so much for other people, encouraged me to give my life to the Lord.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSister Mary Gabriel and Sisters of Life at the March for Life/Devlin family\n\nNow pro-life voice in defense of the unborn is also coming from among the Devlins\u2019 17 grandchildren.\nGranddaughter Aidan held a mother and baby collection at her New Jersey parish, with shopping bags full of diapers and clothes donated to a local pregnancy center.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I was in 10th grade, I attended the Hugh O\u2019Brian Youth Leadership Seminar,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring a group activity we had to come up with a way to take action towards a particular issue in our community. My group agreed on the topic of teen pregnancy.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a tricky topic because my views were not the same as my peers,\u201d Aidan Devlin said. \u201cWhen my peers suggested abortion clinics as one of the ways to prevent teen pregnancy, I knew I couldn't continue in that direction.\u201d\nThat prompted her to reach out to her parish in New Jersey and propose the idea of a pregnancy center drive connected to Mother\u2019s Day. Her parish youth leader welcomed the idea and had her announce the collection after Sunday Masses. The donations were donated to Siena House, a shelter in the Bronx that provides support to mothers.\u00a0\nAidan Devlin plans to hold the Mother\u2019s Day drive again this spring. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\npregnancy help\nprolife\nBill Devlin\nPeggy Devlin\nMarch for Life\nNellie Gray\nRoe v Wade\nSister Mary Gabriel\nSisters of Life\npregnancy help family legacies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatty Knap\n\nPatty Knap is a certified pregnancy counselor, faith formation teacher, ABA therapist for autism, and freelance writer from Long Island.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\n\n\nArrow was prenatally diagnosed with Trisomy 13.
