Mike Pence just signed that would bar \u201cthe knowing provision of sex-, race-, or disability-selective abortions by abortion providers.\u201d The bill was not nearly as innocuous as Fichter and his ideological peers in state government made it seem. In fact, the legislation, colloquially known as a \u201creasons ban,\u201d operates very much on racist and ableist assumptions\u2014and has the power to inflict acute harm on pregnant individuals.\u00a0\nJustice Clarence Thomas called abortion \u201can act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation\u201d and wrote that Indiana\u2019s law furthered a \u201ccompelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky quickly sued the state, challenging both the reasons ban and a broader package of abortion restrictions\u00a0that dealt with fetal remains. Several courts struck down the reasons ban, and last year, Box v. Planned Parenthood reached the Supreme Court. The court ultimately declined to rule on the reasons ban portion of the case, sending it back to the Seventh Circuit on the grounds that there was no split in the lower courts. Justice Clarence Thomas, though, left zero ambiguity about where he stood: In a sweeping 20-page concurring opinion, he called abortion \u201can act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation\u201d and\u00a0wrote that Indiana\u2019s law furthered a \u201ccompelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not exactly a new argument\u2014prominent Republican politicians such as Herman Cain, Ted Cruz, and Ben Carson have long discussed it as well. But over the past few years, it\u2019s gained steam among anti-abortion\u00a0advocates who increasingly claim they are doing their work on behalf of racial justice.\nBack in 2015, following a series of high-profile killings of Black men and women, conservative activist Star Parker told the Washington Examiner, \u201cWe can talk all day about \u2018black lives matter,\u2019 but if we exclude abortion from this discussion, we\u2019ve excluded the fundamentals of this discussion.\u201d In late 2017, award-winning filmmaker Yoruba Richen released a short film, Anti-Abortion Crusaders: Inside the African-American Abortion Battle, which examines the way the anti-abortion movement has capitalized on the (very real) inequities Black people face as a means to bolster its argument against abortion as health care\u2014a film she says she made after uncovering a slew of anti-abortion propaganda that claimed abortion was \u201cBlack genocide.\u201d One of the characters featured in her film is the Rev. Clenard Childress Jr., a Black evangelical pastor and anti-abortion activist who has called the Black Lives Matter movement the best thing that has ever happened to \u201can anemic black pro-life movement.\u201d\n\u201cThis argument is one that [has] gone into the mainstream and deals with race in a way that reproductive justice people haven\u2019t dealt with effectively. And I think it is something that needs to be looked at and followed, because it has grown,\u201d Richen told Vox. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it in videos, and billboards, and postcards and [from] politicians. It\u2019s something that people should be aware of.\u201d\nNow, this revitalized emphasis on banning abortions for supposed reasons of race is\u00a0colliding with the country\u2019s reckoning over racial injustice. \u201cRacial justice concerns are more front of mind for everybody, and that\u2019s true even for abortion opponents,\u201d says Mary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law and the author of Abortion and the Law in America. \u201cEverybody wants to be on the side of the angels when it comes to racial justice.\u201d\nStill, this anti-abortion argument is deeply\u00a0flawed.\u00a0The idea of banning abortion for reasons of race is, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, \u201cbased on the idea that women of color are coerced into abortions or are complicit in a \u2018genocide\u2019 against their own community.\u201d There is no evidence to support that theory. But it\u2019s still proven to be an effective message in abortion wars at the state level: In 2019, at least 18 bans on abortion for reasons of race and/or sex were proposed at the state and federal levels\u2014up from six in 2018, 11 in 2017, and eight in 2016, according to Rewire News\u2018 Legislative Tracker. This year, both Mississippi and Tennessee signed bans on race-selective abortion into law; Tennessee was part of a larger omnibus package that has been placed on hold by the courts, but Mississippi\u2019s was a standalone law that has yet to be challenged. (Reasons bans also sometimes include language about gender and disability discrimination.) Such laws have seen varied results in the courts, and currently, just three states have\u00a0bans tied to race selection in effect: Arizona, Mississippi, and Missouri.\u00a0\n\u201cRacial justice concerns are more front of mind for everybody, and that\u2019s true even for abortion opponents.\u201d\nWhat a reasons ban looks like in practice can vary widely, in part because the very premise is purely theoretical (and false). But worst case, the law can require providers to ask invasive questions of women of color who seek abortion care, questions that rely on racist stereotypes\u2014adding yet another hard layer to the already significant emotional stress of jumping through hoops to terminate a pregnancy. In some places, this means the abortion provider must sign an affidavit promising that the abortion is not being performed because of \u201cthe child\u2019s sex or race.\u201d In short, these laws put women of color in the position of having to justify their need for abortion care.\nUltimately, such bans intimate \u201cthat abortion is like eugenics, it is the targeting of Black people, and these laws are now being framed as saving Black babies or saving babies that would otherwise be born with disabilities as a counteractive to eugenics,\u201d says Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of the recent book Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood.\nSuch arguments resurfaced with vigor last month when Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced that it would remove Margaret Sanger\u2019s name from its Manhattan health clinic due to her \u201charmful connections to the eugenics movement.\u201d The so-called pro-lifers cheered loudly. Sanger is best known for founding Planned Parenthood, then called the American Birth Control League, in the early 1920s, but her legacy has long been marred by her interactions with the eugenics movement\u2014which anti-abortion advocates have weaponized as evidence that abortion care is simply eugenics put into practice. Sanger also gave a speech to a women\u2019s auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan in 1926, as explained in a 2016 fact sheet published by Planned Parenthood (which includes a note saying that in the 1920s, the KKK \u201cwas a mainstream movement and was considered a legitimate anti-immigration organization,\u201d but notes that present-day Planned Parenthood \u201cdenounces Sanger\u2019s address to the Ku Klux Klan\u201d). According to the New York Times, Merle McGee, the New York chapter\u2019s chief equity and engagement officer, explained that the decision came out of \u201ca three-year effort to tackle racism internally and to improve relationships with groups led by Black women who have been wary of Planned Parenthood\u2019s origins.\u201d\nFollowing the announcement, the National Review\u00a0crowed, \u201cNext Up: Abortion Needs to Be Canceled.\u201d An op-ed in America\u00a0magazine, a Jesuit publication, reads, \u201cIt is certainly a welcome acknowledgment of historical fact that Planned Parenthood is owning the racist, eugenicist history of Sanger. But this does not excuse their continued perpetuation of her legacy through their insidious practice of targeting the most vulnerable, especially poor women and women of color (both of whose populations so often intersect), by locating the vast majority of Planned Parenthood clinics within walking distance of nonwhite neighborhoods.\u201d (Nevermind that\u00a0Life Dynamics, an organization that\u00a0opposes abortion, inadvertently debunked this claim in a 2011 report that showed there are only about 110 Planned Parenthood clinics, out of about 800, in neighborhoods where the Black population exceeds 25 percent of the overall population.) A USA Today op-ed written by Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, also conveyed a similar sentiment, while Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, crafted a Twitter thread off the news that specifically invokes reasons bans as a solution to the ways that \u201cMargaret Sanger\u2019s racist legacy continues today\u201d:\u00a0\n\nToday\u2019s decision by Planned Parenthood, America\u2019s largest abortion biz & largest pop. control org in the world, to remove Margaret Sanger\u2019s name from their Manhattan abortion facility is the first time in their 104 yr history that they\u2019ve acknowledged their racist roots 1/6\n\u2014 MarjorieDannenfelser (@marjoriesba) July 21, 2020\n\nGoodwin, a Black academic who has spent her career examining how the United States\u2019 legal system fails Black women, says this obsession with abortion as racial eugenics is both deeply misguided and historically inaccurate.\u00a0She explains that the US eugenics movement began as the country was coming out of its doomed reconstruction effort in the early 1900s, and, yes, during the rise of Jim Crow\u2014but also as political and business leaders began to fear that poor white people may align themselves politically with Black people.\u00a0So while eugenics was partly a way to limit the political power that could be attained by Black people, it first targeted poor white people who were seen as a burden on society. \u201cThe effort is to get rid of poor white people quite specifically and to make sure the poor white people can\u2019t reproduce,\u201d Goodwin says. A model law was developed in the early 1920s that said if a woman was determined to be socially, morally, or physically unfit, she could be sterilized against her will. As Goodwin explains, this law was considered in the famous Buck v. Bell Supreme Court case, in which a teenager named Carrie Buck was raped by a member of her foster family and sterilized after she gave birth on the basis that she was \u201cfeeble-minded.\u201d Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., famously wrote in his opinion, which supported the doctor who wished to sterilize Buck against her will, that \u201c[t]hree generations of imbeciles are enough.\u201d\n\u201cAmericans are really so uninformed about its history of eugenics in the United States, they say, \u2018Look, Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist herself,\u2019 but it\u2019s important to know that early framing of eugenics, horrible as it was, was about whiteness early on.\u201d\n\u201c[But] because Americans are really so uninformed about its history of eugenics in the United States, they say, \u2018Look, Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist herself,\u2019 but it\u2019s important to know that early framing of eugenics, horrible as it was, was about whiteness early on,\u201d Goodwin says. \u201cEquating this with race is false, it\u2019s not true. Later the platform morphed during Jim Crow to include Black folks.\u201d\nShe adds, \u201cStrategically it\u2019s become an added cannon to the arsenal of those who are anti-abortion who are seeking to not operate on fact in these spaces, but in fact to trigger emotional responses.\u201d\nElizabeth Nash, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute who tracks state abortion policy, agrees, and thinks that reasons bans are created to operate as \u201ca wedge.\u201d \u201cSome of the point of them was to split up progressives and for conservatives to try to make an argument that they were supporting racial justice or they were supporting women\u2019s rights or they were supporting the disability community,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen in fact all they want to do is ban abortion and they\u2019ll use any tool in the toolbox to do so.\u201d\u00a0\nTo be sure, part of what makes the anti-abortion movement\u2019s race-based strategy so disturbing (and arguably so effective, though there is little hard data regarding its effect) is that it highlights real failures within the abortion rights community to adequately engage with race. Goodwin points back to the 1980s, for instance, when Black women were prosecuted for giving birth to so-called \u201ccrack babies\u201d\u2014racist rhetoric that was presented as defining\u00a0an epidemic. Broadly speaking, largely white-led abortion rights organizations have historically done a poor job of advocating for women of color and of recognizing racial disparities in reproductive health care, which has led to deep fissures in the broader movement\u2014some of which still exist today.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was exactly in those spaces where the reproductive rights movement was failing. It wasn\u2019t a reproductive justice movement\u2014because they should have seen it for what it was,\u201d Goodwin says. \u201cThere has been the failure to appropriately and meaningfully engage race such that now they\u2019re playing catch up on these banning abortions in cases of race and sex selection, right? It\u2019s like the anti-abortion movement out-pivoted the reproductive rights movement on race.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile reproductive justice groups\u2014which have primarily been led by women of color\u2014and abortion rights groups, which have historically been more white, have come together around common goals in recent years, there still much work to be done, by white women in particular. In the meantime, the endgame for anti-abortion groups is always to erase the right to abortion in the United States, and at its core, a reasons ban is no different. \u201cIt\u2019s designed multiple ways from a strategy standpoint to change what it means that there\u2019s a right to abortion,\u201d Ziegler says. \u201cIf you can ban specific kinds of procedures for specific kinds of reasons, the right starts to mean less and less, which makes it easier to ask the court to overturn Roe later\u2014because the idea that women rely on abortion when the right to abortion is increasingly narrow stops making sense.\u201d\nImages from left: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty, Sarah Silbiger/Getty, Ira L.
