Conservative Alberta MP\u2019s riding association buys pro-life transit ads in Vancouver\t\t\n\n\nby David ClimenhagaNovember 2, 2020November 2, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan MP Garnett Genuis (Photo: David J. Climenhaga). \n\n\n\nRegardless of exactly how Garnett Genuis\u2019s Vancouver bus advertisement asking how there can be too many children was paid for, the Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan MP well known for his vocal opposition to reproductive rights and the Conservative Party of Canada should both have some explaining to do.Mr. Genuis boasted about the appearance of the ad in a tweet yesterday, which was the first most people around his riding just east of Edmonton had heard about it.One of Mr. Genuis\u2019s riding association\u2019s advertisements on a Vancouver bus (Photo: Twitter).The ad, featuring a photo of three adorable toddlers and an infant, quotes Mother Theresa asking, \u201cHow can there be too many children? That is like saying there are too many flowers.\u201dCritics immediately jumped on the ads arguing their intent was to attack the right of Canadian women to reproductive freedom. \n\n\nFor his part, the 33-year-old MP offered a different explanation, claiming to be countering a \u201cfalse population control narrative\u201d and standing up for families.According to the Mr. Genuis, well known for his opposition to reproductive rights, the advertisement was just countering a message that he says appeared on earlier bus advertisements seen in Vancouver. He has also argued that calls to restrict family size are often motivated by racism.But as one blunt response to that claim put it: \u201c\u2018Countering the false population control narrative\u2019? Do you think you\u2019re being clever? Everyone knows these are pro-life ads with the intended effect to reduce women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201dWhat really raised eyebrows in Mr. Genuis\u2019s riding and beyond was the statement, clearly visible on the ad, that it was \u201csponsored by contributors to the Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan Conservative Riding Association.\u201dThis had B.C. residents wondering, \u201cWhy is the Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan (Alberta) Conservative Riding Association sponsoring ads on buses in Vancouver, B.C.?\u201d Good question. Maybe its members think the West Coast metropolis is too liberal. \n\n\nConservative Party of Canada Leader Erin O\u2019Toole in 2014 (Photo: Manning Centre).Now, the funding explanation in the ad is somewhat ambiguous, probably intentionally. Does it mean the ads were paid for directly with tax-deductible political donations? Or merely that they were paid for by people who also happened to be contributors to Mr. Genuis\u2019s election campaign?Certainly, these natural questions gave Mr. Genuis an opportunity to provide a link to his bloviations on the topic in the Post Millennial, the far-right website that appears to exist largely to attack Justin Trudeau, the Liberal government in Ottawa, and ride social conservative hobbyhorses. This has earned it the love of politicians like Andrew Scheer, the former Conservative Party of Canada leader who touted it to supporters after losing last year\u2019s federal election.In another tweet, Mr. Genuis said \u201cour response was fully crowd-funded.\u201d If so, though, why was the constituency association even mentioned?This suggests, at least, that Mr. Genuis, whose name is not spelled genius, was trying to be clever.Remember, about this time last year he was in hot water for raising the abortion issue, along with Alberta separatism, in a flyer poll mailed to his constituents at a time when the Conservatives then led by Mr. Scheer kept insisting the issue was \u2014 nudge, nudge, wink, wink \u2014 settled.Perhaps the funding questions about the ad could have been asked back on Oct. 8, when Mr. Genuis clearly signalled his intentions in the House of Commons. \u201cMy riding association is fighting back,\u201d he told inattentive MPs and Press Gallery members that day. \u201cWe are taking out ads on buses in Vancouver\u2026\u201dAlas, no one thought to ask, \u201cSay what? How are you paying for these ads? Are any House of Commons funds or resources being used to raise the money? How was the pitch delivered to CPC donors in the riding? Is buying ads in Vancouver appropriate behaviour for an Alberta MP?\u201d And so on.Oh well, the days are long gone when Alberta news operations kept their own reporters in nation\u2019s capital to keep an eye on the province\u2019s MPs. Why bother? They\u2019re mostly all on the same team anyway.Likewise, since the Conservative Party of Canada has a new leader who says he\u2019s trying to increase the size of the party\u2019s ever more restrictive tent, this is bound to raise the issue again of where it actually stands on reproductive rights.Erin O\u2019Toole has billed himself as a pro-choice MP \u2014 although his voting record is somewhat mixed on the issue. He\u2019s also said he wants to ensure the Conservative Party reflects the interests of more Canadians than just the social conservatives and market fundamentalists who have increasingly dominated it in recent years.Mr. Genuis\u2019s gambit into West Coast advertising raises the question of just how serious Mr. O\u2019Toole is about this.Is he going to make excuses for MPs like Mr. Genuis, singularly focussed on social conservative issues and inclined to get up to embarrassing nonsense like this dog-whistling Vancouver bus ad?If so, that sounds like an excellent way for the Conservatives to alienate voters in Canada\u2019s largest cities. \n\nTagged: Alberta politics,\u00a0Andrew Scheer,\u00a0Canadian Politics,\u00a0Conservative Party of Canada,\u00a0Erin O\u2019Toole,\u00a0Garnett Genuis,\u00a0Liberal Party of Canada,\u00a0Reproductive Rights,\u00a0Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan Riding \n\n\n\n\n\t\tJoin the Conversation\t\t\n\n\n 9 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.

Yes, they are all one grand party! Are you aware that #shpk #fortsask CPC MP Garnett Genuis wholeheartedly supports the UCP agenda of cuts to health and public education.  He has always sought to federally impose his religious morality on our secular society, for example reproductive healthcare choices \u2013 he seems to think women are not smart enough to make decisions regarding their own bodies and actively recruits antichoice politicians on municipal, provincial and federal levels.  He forces his own regressive, outdated ideology into his work such as forming the Alberta chapter of Parents for Choice in Education.  Last week Genuis argued against Conversion Therapy in the HoC but cowardly didn\u2019t register his vote.  Research will inform you that both Genuis and Kenney are religious zealots, Dominionist Christians, and paleolibertarians (research the IDU and their chairman, Stephen Harper).   Just like Trump has done in the US, Kenney is in the process of installing a theocratic kleptocracy that will take over the rest of Canada if CPC gets elected. This is what happens when Christo Fascists are elected.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nDave in Sask says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2, 2020 at 10:22 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAds of any kind by a riding association or MP should at the very least start in his own riding or at least a paper serving his/her riding.  Then if the riding wants it to get more coverage then go in other media in the province the MP is from, finally if more coverage is sought, go national.\nTo do it the way it was done is chicken hearted as though not wanting to make local support peed off by thinking about the subject.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nAbs says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2, 2020 at 10:38 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThe C-mafia strikes again.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nPolitical Ranger says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2, 2020 at 10:46 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 \u2013 3 times as many humans on the globe as can be supported by anything resembling nature.\nThese guys (conservatives) are all ignorant frauds.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nJust Me says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2, 2020 at 7:41 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Genuis ain\u2019t no genius.\nI have wondered why B.C. hates Alberta; now, I know that it\u2019s all Alberta\u2019s fault. No surprise.\nI came across a recent develop where the Angry Midget was trying to explain why Alberta cannot accept (the UCP refuses to use) the federal Covid tracking app. While Kenney went into some highly-convoluted justification for this latest crazy, he managed to get no where explaining away the nonsense of the UCP\u2019s decision. In the end, it all came across to the listener as more of the irrationale why Kenney wants a Alberta-only pension plan and provincial police force \u2014 he hates Ottawa and doesn\u2019t want PMJT to get anymore credit for doing the right thing for Albertans.\nThe level of the Angry Midget\u2019s crazy is becoming so weird, maybe he should just slip himself back into quarantine, until he can make up his mind to go back to Ottawa, where he\u2019s truly happy.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nJoan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2, 2020 at 7:55 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nWell of course there can be too many flowers. If you plant too many flowers, they will not have enough sun or soil or water. They will grow up weak and stunted. So his real message is that we wants our children to be weak and stunted.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nJim says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 3, 2020 at 1:43 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nI think this poor man, apparently an MP, has been watching a little too much American media. There is a lot of that going around these days, you can tell when no one understands outside the small echo chamber what the hell they are saying. We don\u2019t seem to have anyone advocating things like what Virginia Governor Northam has been quoted saying. Hopefully that kind of thing doesn\u2019t cross the border with the flood of refugees after tomorrows election.\nI would be interested to know what the limits are for spending tax deductible contributions are if any. Maybe when Allen is done tracking down those foreigners Kenney is always taking about he can take up the task\u2026.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nDave says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 3, 2020 at 2:33 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThis is indeed strange, Mr. Genuis seems a bit out of his natural habitat with transit ads in Vancouver, leading me to wonder what prompted it and if he is a stable Genuis or not.  Vancouver is not even a common stop over on the flight from Edmonton to Ottawa.\nI suspect Mr. O\u2019Toole will do nothing about this.  I wonder if this is a push back from social conservatives, a testing of the limits under the new leader or perhaps a bit of both.  Well, they probably were not going to win a lot of seats in metro Vancouver anyways, although this surely doesn\u2019t help.\nIt also does cause one to wonder if the Socons are still in charge despite Mr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s more friendly modern face currently at the front of the Conservative store.  Even if he is genuinely trying to lead his party in a different direction, it already seems there is some reluctance to follow.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPingback: Weekly Update: 7-Nov-2020 to 13-Nov-2020 | Canadian Atheist \n\n\n\nLeave a comment\n\nCancel replyYour email address will not be published.
