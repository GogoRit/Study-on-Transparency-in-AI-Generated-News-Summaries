As a\u00a0result, women have too often been left with\u00a0an overwhelming share of the burden of the decision making around reproductive health and securing health care. Add to that, the conservative agenda in some parts of the world that seeks to roll back\u00a0women\u2019s right to choose both whether to terminate a\u00a0pregnancy and even to have access to a full range of family planning and reproductive health services.\nFew studies have directly examined men\u2019s roles in women\u2019s decision-making and experiences around abortion, or men\u2019s own experiences related to abortion.
