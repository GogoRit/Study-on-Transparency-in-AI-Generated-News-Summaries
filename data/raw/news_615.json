His home country of Poland just passed a near-total ban on abortions, and the frontman has slammed the government and its \"religious cancer.\"According to BBC, the ban was first issued in October, which\u00a0resulted in protests around the nation. As of Wednesday night, the ban has been set in motion by the government, only allowing abortions in cases of rape, incest or when the pregnancy poses harm to the mother.A \"passionately enraged\" Nergal took to his Instagram to address the matter.\"We are moving back to the obscure, scary, medieval past. From now on my dear women, in the eyes of Polish political leaders you are just a breeding tool in their rigorous Catholic narration, you have no control over your body whatsoever,\" he wrote.\"What one can do? Well, the battle is lost\u2026 but the war is to be won by those enlightened, forward thinking. Do not\u00a0cease your fight, spread the word, speak up and support Polish women in their relentless struggle! Exterminate religious cancer!\u00a0Fuck the system!\"Read his full post below.Nergal spoke with Full Metal Jackie back in October regarding his willingness to share\u00a0his opinions on such issues. After expressing he believes that a lot of countries are moving backwards as far as political and social progress, he said, \"It's pretty crucial to bring that out and have an open discussion. Sometimes using fists, sometimes not, but it's, it's pretty essential.\"20 Artists Who Told Politicians to Stop Using Their MusicFiled Under: Behemoth, NergalCategories: Metal, NewsCommentsLeave A CommentMore From Loudwire10 Times Bands Lied to Their Fans10 Times Bands Lied to Their Fans27 Rock + Metal Bands That Played Over 150 Shows in One Year27 Rock + Metal Bands That Played Over 150 Shows in One Year10 Years Ago: Behemoth Release Their Masterpiece, \u2018The Satanist\u201910 Years Ago: Behemoth Release Their Masterpiece, \u2018The Satanist\u201920 Important Rock + Metal Albums Turning 20 in 202420 Important Rock + Metal Albums Turning 20 in 2024More Than 20 Big Rock + Metal Albums Turning 10 in 2024More Than 20 Big Rock + Metal Albums Turning 10 in 202413 Rock + Metal Artists Who Were Banned From Countries13 Rock + Metal Artists Who Were Banned From Countries25 Legendary Extreme Metal Albums With No Weak Songs25 Legendary Extreme Metal Albums With No Weak Songs10 Most Terrifying Live Bands10 Most Terrifying Live BandsThe Best Album by 30 Legendary Metal BandsThe Best Album by 30 Legendary Metal BandsInformationContact UsAdvertisePrivacyExercise My Data RightsFollow UsVisit us on InstagramVisit us on YoutubeVisit us on FacebookVisit us on Twitter2024 Loudwire, Townsquare Media, Inc.
