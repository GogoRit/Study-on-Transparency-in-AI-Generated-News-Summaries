Wade, Indiana clinics submitted an average of 1,048 terminated pregnancy reports each month, according to Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) data obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. \nBut those abortion reports dropped sharply between October and January, averaging just 552 terminations per month. That is well below monthly averages for previous years.\u00a0\nState lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban in August, but the procedure remains legal in Indiana while the law is being challenged in court. Under an injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law stands \u2014 allowing abortions up to 20 weeks.\nStill, providers say patients are confused about what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not, adding that such bans create a \u201cchilling effect\u201d and discourage people from seeking out the procedure in Indiana.\u00a0\nStaff shortages are additionally limiting the ability of Hoosier clinics to provide abortions.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Indianapolis clinic \u2014 that provided the largest number of abortions in 2021 \u2014 hasn\u2019t performed abortions since at least the end of February. The organization didn\u2019t respond to requests about the matter but the website for the Georgetown Road location says it is providing only \u201cabortion referrals.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for the folks who are following this and are aware of the injunction, it\u2019s still confusing.\n\n\n\u2013 Dr. Katie McHugh\n\n\nDr. Katie McHugh, a licensed gynecologist in Indianapolis who provides abortion care, attributed much of the decline to uncertainty surrounding Indiana\u2019s laws and whether the ban is still in effect.\n\u201cWe still have patients coming in or calling into the clinic saying, \u2018Where do I go? Can you refer me to a place out of state?\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018Sure. But we can also see you here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cEven for the folks who are following this and are aware of the injunction, it\u2019s still confusing.\u201d\nMcHugh said she and other abortion care providers operate in a sort of legal limbo, where the anticipated decision from the Indiana Supreme Court could alter their practice indefinitely.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s very complicated when you\u2019re trying to schedule patients, when you\u2019re trying to place supply orders (on medicine) \u2026 if you don\u2019t know if you can literally provide care tomorrow,\u201d McHugh said.\nKatie Blair, advocacy and public policy director for the ACLU of Indiana \u2014 who has filed two lawsuits against the state ban \u2014 said \u201cAlthough abortion remains legal, in the past decade, the Indiana General Assembly has enacted more than 50 abortion restrictive laws. These laws, combined with the looming ban that is now held up in the courts can make it more challenging for providers to offer reproductive care, and more difficult for women to access the care they need.\u201d\nBy the numbers\nIn July, August and September, seven abortion care providers licensed in Indiana reported more than 1,000 pregnancy terminations each month, while abortions over the same time period in 2021 averaged just under 700 per month.\nThe state health department hasn\u2019t yet released its full 2022 report, meaning the latest comparable numbers are from 2021.\u00a0\nThe newest data provided by IDOH also only reflect when reports were submitted \u2014 not necessarily when the procedures were performed. But providers have 30 days to file the paperwork.\u00a0\nIn the late summer months, part of the demand came from neighboring states with restrictive laws on abortion, McHugh said. As laws changed, so has the demand.\n\n\nIndiana Department of Health received the following terminated pregnancy reports:\nJuly 2022 \u2013 1035\nAugust 2022 \u2013 1081\nSeptember 2022 \u2013 1030\nOctober 2022 \u2013 446\nNovember 2022 \u2013 605\nDecember 2022 \u2013 755\nJanuary 2023 \u2013 405\n\n\n\u201cOther states that were previously banned now have injunctions in place so that care is accessible,\u201d McHugh said, highlighting Ohio.\u00a0\nMost abortions were illegal in Ohio as soon as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in late June. Several Ohio clinics challenged the law, which started once embryonic cardiac activity could be detected around six weeks. A court issued an injunction on that ban in October.\nOver the summer, Indiana made national news after a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio sought abortion care in the Hoosier State. The child was one of potentially hundreds of Ohioans who left their home state to seek abortion care providers.\u00a0\nAs Indiana grappled with its own new restrictions, reported abortions fell to half the previous month\u2019s reports, from 1,030 in September to 446 in October \u2014 even though abortion in Indiana was only illegal for about a week.\nThe 405 terminated pregnancy reports submitted in January 2023 is roughly half of the 793 terminations reported for January 2021.\nIDOH doesn\u2019t have February numbers yet, prolonging uncertainty about the impacts of the temporary closure of the Planned Parenthood location on the north side of Indiana in late February. That clinic alone performed more than one-quarter, or 29%, of all the state\u2019s abortions in 2021.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood, which operates four of the seven clinics providing abortion services, did not respond to multiple Capital Chronicle requests for comment.\nWomen\u2019s Med Group Professional Corporation of Indianapolis, the clinic performing the second highest number of abortions in Indiana, performed 27% of the state\u2019s procedures in 2021. The location similarly told the Capital Chronicle it needs to train more staff but declined to give an interview before publication.\nBoth clinics, along with Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, were part of the lawsuit that paused the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\u00a0\nThose bans, according to Whole Woman\u2019s founder and CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller, only kept people from accessing safe abortions in their communities.\n\u201cThe same amount of people still need access to safe abortion; abortion bans don\u2019t change the number of people that have unplanned pregnancies,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s not reducing the need, it\u2019s just making people have to travel farther and oftentimes pushing them further into their pregnancy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Indiana Right to Life CEO Mike Fichter said his group \u201csuspect(s) Indiana briefly became an abortion destination in the months following Dobbs,\u201d especially for women coming from Ohio and Kentucky.\n\u201cBoth of these states had strong pro-life laws in effect almost immediately after Roe was overturned, yet Indiana\u2019s new law did not go into effect until mid-September, and then just briefly, before it was blocked in court,\u201d Fichter said in a written statement. \u201cHad the legislature not tightened Indiana\u2019s abortion law in last year\u2019s special session, there is little doubt abortions would have continued to skyrocket in our state.\u201d\n\u2018Help Wanted\u2019 at abortion clinics\nAs the availability of abortion wavered, doctors made other plans. Illinois became a hotspot, as the \u201csanctuary\u201d state saw demand surge as all of its neighbors pursued bans. Pushed out of their home states, many physicians opted to license in Illinois and other states.\nMcHugh, for her part, chose to license in Ohio and Maryland.\n\u201cWe are all still in Indiana, though many of us have also become licensed in other states and are providing abortion care in other states,\u201d McHugh said. \u201cThat is not necessarily the reason for decreased access, that is more a function of the\u2026 instability around whether abortion will remain legal in Indiana.\u201d\nAs a licensed doctor, McHugh said she had flexibility that other staff didn\u2019t \u2014 including positions at other clinics and health services beyond abortion.\u00a0\n  Dr. Katie McHugh\n\u201cIt is very difficult to keep staff at the front desk or people to help take vitals,\u201d McHugh said. \u201c(Those employees) need to make sure they have a steady and stable income to feed their families and pay their bills. It is very different for us to ask these low-paid but dedicated employees to continue to show up for a job that may not exist next week.\u201d\nHagstrom Miller, with Woman\u2019s Health, reported the same staffing difficulty. One staffer relocated to Virginia while another took a different position within the company. Since the ban passed, the clinic hasn\u2019t always been able to schedule appointments and closed intermittently.\n\u201cPeople want to be sure they have a stable income for their families,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cI think all clinics are navigating this.\u201d\nThe South Bend clinic, located at the Michigan border and roughly 90 minutes from Chicago, has the option to divert patients elsewhere if they can\u2019t get scheduled in Indiana, including a virtual option in Illinois.\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes I call this the era of uncertainty. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty because we don\u2019t know how long we can promise somebody work and we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll be able to be open,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the final decision from the lawsuit.\u201d\nMcHugh also doesn\u2019t expect relief soon \u2013 so long as the abortion ban (or lack thereof) remains uncertain. But she said clinics have the responsibility to train their staff to ensure the safety of the procedure \u2013 which has a complication rate far below childbirth, especially in states like Indiana that have a high maternal mortality rate.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that patients are safe; that the employees are supported with the education and the training they need,\u201d McHugh said.\nHagstrom Miller wants Hoosier women to know that the clinic\u2019s abortion care providers can still connect people to services, including funding and travel support.\n\u201cWe are still answering our phones\u2026 we\u2019re helping Hoosiers either get medication abortion by mail in Illinois, to travel to Indianapolis where clinics might be open or travel to Illinois or Michigan,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cThe one promise we know we can keep to our patients is that we\u2019re going to answer those phones and we\u2019re going to give you the most current information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIndiana abortions drop significantly, despite pause on statewide ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle March 15, 2023\nIndiana abortions drop significantly, despite pause on statewide ban\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle March 15, 2023\n Abortions in Indiana spiked in the months following the Dobbs ruling, but the number of procedures happening across the state has since dropped nearly 50%, according to newly released state data.\u00a0\nThe first three months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
