(Courtesy of Shutterstock /VGstockstudio) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people with disabilities struggle with their identity and with fitting into society, often feeling isolated and lacking access to many things \u2013 from disability-friendly buildings to supportive policies.Talking about sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) alone is hard for some, let alone for persons with disabilities (PDWs).\n\u201cTo talk about SRHR is a challenge even for a normal person and it becomes even more challenging for a person with a disability. But nothing is a challenge if you use the right language,\u201d said Tanzila Khan, founder of Creative Alley in Pakistan.\nConfined to her wheelchair since birth, Khan works to bridge the gap between disabilities and SRHR through her organization, which promotes young talent through trainings, projects and events.\nKhan said she was aware that, despite coming from an orthodox society that is not supportive toward women, her power was her public speaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI could always apply my advocacy skills, and now my entire family is on board. So my first leadership project was my own family and my society around me,\u201d said Khan, who says her privileged background is what gave her access to education.\nKhan was a plenary speaker at the 10th Asia Pacific Conference on Reproductive and Sexual Health and Rights (APCRSHR10), held online as part of a series organized by the conference\u2019s steering committee, the UNFPA and Citizen News Service (CNS).\nShe said advocating for SRHR was a challenge for any organization working in Pakistan, and to highlight these taboo issues for people with disability at the government and policy level she had to think of innovative ways.\nHer team came up with creative ideas \u2013 from creating plays and films to holding workshops \u2013 to generate a focus on a taboo subject in the community.\n\u201cDisability in itself is a taboo subject, and if combined with SRHR, it becomes like a double scoop ice cream that is difficult to digest for many people, including policymakers and leaders, who are already intolerant,\u201d Khan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the concepts is to use video and theater.\n\u201cOur theater technique was not just a play that one [simply] watches, but being a part of the play \u2013 where we would make the audience become the actors,\u201d Khan said, adding that, through the play, they let people address their own biases in an enjoyable way.\nOther projects, which include workshops with women with disabilities, give them more insight into what goes beyond SRHR and where the gap lies.\n\u201cWe try to bring all communities together. We do not work only for people with disabilities, as this is likely to alienate them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are a part of society, and they require inclusion. Only then can they feel that they are part of the solution and not just part of the problem.\u201d\nHer latest project, Girly things, refocuses on empowering young women, giving them menstrual healthcare information and access to products and services that are regularly available and are also environmentally friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another initiative, Khan and her team created a short film on Comedy and disability, which she said was the very first such content to be produced in her country.\nThe film centers on a girl who has a disability and is not seen as a sexual human being \u2013 a girl who has bills to pay or who might want to get married and have children.\n\u201cThis is what many of us as people with disabilities face. We are expected to become motivational speakers. We are not allowed to frown or cry. We are asked: \u2018Are you crying because of your disability?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, we have other problems, too, like any other person\u2019. This mindset also has to be changed. Our short film ignited a discussion around this.\u201d\nAnother speaker at the conference, Myanmar\u2019s Colorful Girls magazine editor Phyu Nwe Win, disclosed during the Voice from the Frontline session that, in her country, several research findings suggested that PWDs had many unmet SRHR needs.\n\u00a0She said Myanmar was home to some 2.3 million people with disabilities or 4.6 percent of the total population, based on a 2014 census.\n\u201cThis [unmet SRHR needs] is mainly due to false social perceptions that PWDs, especially young women and girls, lack sexual desire and therefore are unlikely to have SRH needs,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSRHR is a taboo topic to talk about, and PWDs are rendered invisible in relation to SRHR. They are stigmatized and excluded from sexuality education programs due to a perceived lack of need.\u201d\n\n\nTanzila Khan (Courtesy of femmerang.com/-)\nAccording to the WHO World Report on Disability, more than 1 billion people, or about 15 percent of the world\u2019s population, have some form of disability. Some 690 million of them are in the Asia Pacific region.\nIndonesia alone, according to 2019 National Social and Economic Survey (Susenas) data, is home to some 25.6 million PWDs, almost 10 percent of the population.\nEven before the pandemic, PWDs were marginalized and not afforded equal access to public services and information, and now they face even greater challenges.\nIn March, a group of deaf people sent an open letter to President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, calling on him to uphold the rights of people with hearing impairments to have access to all COVID-19 information.\nBagja Prawira, one of the activists behind the letter, previously told The Jakarta Post through an interpreter that, with little to no access to information, many deaf people he knew continued to live their lives as normal \u2013 without fully understanding the dangers of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe are facing a disaster, and we have the right to access all information about it,\u201d Bagja said.\nUnder Law No.8/2016 on PWDs, authorities should provide access to public services, information and protection during disasters.\nHowever, an online survey conducted by the Indonesia Disability Network (JDI) in April this year, which involved 1,683 respondents with disabilities from 32 provinces, showed that only around 60 percent of people with disabilities had adequate access to information about the pandemic and how to avoid infection.\nKhan said the entire battle for PWDs was about access, about being part of a public space \u2013 pulling them out of their shells and cocoons.\n\u201cSo disability is not a concept that is limited to one particular body type. It is a mindset. It is an attitude, and many times even the structures in place have a very disabling attitude. Sometimes some attitudes can disable an entire nation or entire community that has a perfectly able body with no impairments,\u201d Khan said.\n\u201cDo not treat people with disabilities just as a beneficiary. They have so much to contribute, so much knowledge to share,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause of my disability I was able to identify the disabling attitudes of society.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonatan Christie wins first All England badminton title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice raid Korea Aerospace after Indonesian nationals accused of jet tech leak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia alleges 10 Indonesians fighting as mercenaries in Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\nAde Paloh, early aughts indie rock icon, dies at 48\n\n\n\n\nBanten fishing village grapples with piles of trash brought in by tides\n\n\n\n\nUniting to tap into water's potential for peace\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian hospital ship concludes humanitarian mission for Palestine\n\n\n\n\nUS Navy, Marine Corps and Indonesian Navy prepare for CARAT 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Article\n\n\n\nAde Paloh, early aughts indie rock icon, dies at 48\n\n\n\n\nBanten fishing village grapples with piles of trash brought in by tides\n\n\n\n\nUniting to tap into water's potential for peace\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian hospital ship concludes humanitarian mission for Palestine\n\n\n\n\nUS Navy, Marine Corps and Indonesian Navy prepare for CARAT 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonatan Christie wins first All England badminton title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice raid Korea Aerospace after Indonesian nationals accused of jet tech leak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia alleges 10 Indonesians fighting as mercenaries in Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Life\n\n\n                                View more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\nAde Paloh, early aughts indie rock icon, dies at 48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Tech\n\nAustralian taxi drivers win $178 million payout from Uber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks\n\nNew book offers new perspective on Banda massacre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulations\n\n Bank of Japan scraps negative interest rate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditorial\n\nKeeping faith in democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\nPrabowo must take charge of coalition, 'cordial' ties with Jokowi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Latest\n\n\n                            View more \n\n\n\n\n\nElection Updates\n\nTwo regions to go before official election results announced\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia & Pacific\n\nUN sounds 'Red Alert' as world smashes heat records in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulations\n\nLawmakers fail with bid to avoid move to Kalimantan\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\nAde Paloh, early aughts indie rock icon, dies at 48\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\nIDX Composite strengthens amid wait for BI, Fed benchmark rates\n\n\n\n\n\nSociety\n\nIndonesia braces for wildfires ahead of dry season\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulations\n\nGovt announces 14 new strategic projects\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\nGoTo Highlights Indonesia\u2019s Digitalization Potential at China E-Commerce Exhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the latest news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nBusiness\nPolitics\nWorld\nIndonesia\nJakarta\n\n\nOpinion\nAcademia\nCommentary\nInsight\nAnalysis\nInterview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\nNews\nDestinations\nJakpost Guide To\n\n\nMultimedia\nVideo\nPhoto\nDeep Dive\nPodcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture\nLifestyle\nEntertainment\nArt & Culture\nTechnology\nPeople\nHealth\nParents\nBooks\n\n\nMore\nToday's Paper\nJobs\nTJP Images\nCommunity\nYouth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nOpinion\nTravel\nMultimedia\nLife\n\n\nToday's Paper\nJobs\nTJP Images\nCommunity\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nCyber Media Guidelines\nContact\nAdvertise\nPaper Subscription\nPrivacy Policy\nDiscussion Guideline\nTerm of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 - 2024 PT.
