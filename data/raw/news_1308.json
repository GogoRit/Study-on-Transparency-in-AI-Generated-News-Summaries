Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state\u2019s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn\u2019t ever mention abortion and so doesn\u2019t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn\u2019t have to be named to be protected. \u201cThis court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written \u201cto almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.\u201d\nThe state is expected to appeal.Ohio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis said his organization was \u201csaddened but not surprised\u201d by the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe abortion clinics literally forum shopped to get the outcome they wanted. This is a moment in time for the pro-life movement and we are convinced that the Ohio Supreme Court will overturn this ruling,\u201d Gonidakis said in a statement. \u201cNowhere in Ohio\u2019s Constitution does a right to an abortion exist.\u201dThe law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibits most abortions after the first detectable \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The law had been blocked through a legal challenge, briefly went into effect when the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned, and then was again put on hold in court.\n\nJenkins\u2019 ruling following a day of testimony that varied little from existing societal and political arguments for and against abortion, and, he said later, surprised him in its failure to plow any new ground. Lawyers for abortion clinics presented witnesses who emphasized that abortion is safe, necessary health care and that pregnant Ohioans seeking the procedure were devastated when the law was briefly imposed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade case in June.Dr. Steven Ralston, a maternal and fetal medicine doctor at the University of Maryland, said limited exceptions included in Ohio\u2019s so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d law are vague and worrisome to physicians, who face losing their medical licenses or felony charges for misinterpretations.He testified to observing more danger to patients in pregnancy than in abortion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many, many more patients end up in intensive care units after having a baby compared to women who have had an abortion,\u201d Ralston said in video testimony. \u201cIn fact, I can\u2019t even remember a time that I\u2019ve seen a woman end up in a care unit after an abortion.\u201dThe state\u2019s attorneys brought witness Dr. Dennis Sullivan, a bioethics expert from Cedarville University, a private Baptist institution, who testified that human life begins at conception and that\u2019s \u201cscientifically not open to debate.\u201dHe said Ohio\u2019s law is \u201cconsistent with good medical practice\u201d and that he views performing abortions under its limited exceptions \u2014 which include the life of the mother or risk of extensive internal organ damage \u2014 is medically ethical. The law contains no exception for fetal anomalies, which Jenkins raised as a question. He asked a series of pointed questions of Sullivan after he was cross-examined, particularly a view he expressed in testimony that his positions on the nature of human life and the unethical nature of pregnancy termination in cases not involving medical emergencies should be imposed on others. \n\n\u201cMy question is what allows you uniquely, or someone else uniquely, to make that judgment any better than the individual whose rights we are being asked to limit, whose autonomy we are being asked to take away?\u201d Jenkins asked.Sullivan responded with an example of a medical situation where a suffering woman\u2019s autonomy might be sacrificed when she arrives at a hospital in need of life-saving care. He also pointed to Ohio laws beyond abortion that limit citizens\u2019 autonomy, such as the state\u2019s ban on assisted suicide. Plaintiffs\u2019 witness Dr. Steven Joffe, a faculty member in the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, testified that Sullivan\u2019s position gave the moral status of an embryo \u201calmost absolute weight\u201d over the pregnant patient.\n\nJenkins said he was most impressed with the testimony of Dr. Michael Parker, a Columbus OB/GYN, whose testimony revealed a patchwork of hypothetical, sometimes conflicting judgment calls he felt would make sense under the law. The judge said that proved to him it\u2019s \u201cextremely difficult to be a practitioner in the state of Ohio under this law.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIE CARR SMYTH\n\n\n                Smyth has covered government and politics from Columbus, Ohio, for The Associated Press since 2006.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
