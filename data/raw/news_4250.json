From gender-based discrimination and violence to unequal access to education and economic resources, women still struggle to gain access to the same rights and opportunities as men. Global Goal 5 promotes gender equality for all. Join us and take action on this issue here.\u00a0While\u00a0individual countries have made progressed in the fight for equal rights, there is still a long way to go before gender equality can be fully achieved on a global scale. Various factors go into measuring gender equality. Currently, the average global gender gap is 31.4%.\u00a0Political empowerment, education attainment, health and survival, and economic participation and opportunity\u00a0are the four indexes that help to measure and determine global gender equality, according to the 2020 Global Gender Gap report.The Global Gender Gap report is an annual analysis of how close or far the world is to achieving gender equality worldwide. Released by the World Economic Forum, the report uses the aforementioned factors as guidelines to measure overall equality or lack thereof on the basis of sex and gender.\u00a0Political EmpowermentWhile 108 participating countries have made significant strides toward achieving political empowerment for women and girls, it remains the category with the greatest gender disparity. The gap on this sub-index has only been closed by 25% so far, meaning there are still not enough women occupying seats in government on a global scale.\u00a0Equal representation in government is crucial to achieving gender equality. Governmental bodies should be representative of every constituent so that all individuals can be heard and have a say.A group of girls laugh together in Korogocho slum, one of Nairobi's most populated informal settlements.A group of girls laugh together in Korogocho slum, one of Nairobi's most populated informal settlements.Image: Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images/Images of EmpowermentWomen make up around 24% of legislative bodies around the world, according to the Pew Research Center. While this has increased significantly from the previous decade, women are still severely underrepresented in government.The political empowerment index, however, fails to measure the legal rights of women and girls in comparison to those of men, which plays a significant role in determining the extent to which a society is equal.\u00a0Electing more women to political leadership positions would\u00a0allow more opportunities to pass laws that ultimately expand women\u2019s rights.\"Although progress [has been] made in advancing women\u2019s rights, it has been slow and inconsistent, and many sex-discriminatory laws remain entrenched,\u201d Romina Canessa, a human rights lawyer at Equality Now, told Global Citizen.\u00a0\u201cWhen governments deny women and girls the same rights as men and boys, this legitimizes discrimination and abuse, and means they have no formal recourse if their rights are violated.\u201dProtecting the legal rights of women is vital in the fight to achieve full gender equality, she said, adding that all laws that discriminate on the basis of gender must be repealed.Economic Participation and OpportunityWomen are also disproportionately underrepresented in the global economy and the labor market compared to men. The economic and labor market gender index gap has only been closed by 58% and even increased in 2019. On average, only 55% of women are currently participating in the global workforce, and their presence in higher-yielding positions is even lower.Linda Berko, a talented tailor and seamstress, runs a stand in Kwame Nkrumah Circle Market in Accra, Ghana.

All of these components highlight the challenges women face to escape poverty and become financially and economically independent.\u00a0Educational AttainmentAt least 35 countries have closed the education gender gap by 96.1%. However, this gap varies across education levels. The majority of girls (90%)\u00a0between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate, compared to 92.9% of boys within the same age range. In 2018, approximately 88.2% of girls were enrolled in primary school worldwide.Girls are less likely to receive an education due to gender-based discrimination, child marriage, and the burden of fulfilling domestic chores, all of which prevent young girls and teengagers from attending school.\u00a0While progress has been made, there is still room for improvement. More young girls and women are attending primary and secondary school, but less than half are going on to attend college. Women are also still fighting to be fully represented in the job market.\u00a0Health and SurvivalAlthough the global gender gap for health care and survival has been closed by 95.7%, millions of women across the world still do not have equal access to health care, especially reproductive health care.\u00a0Life expectancy is increasing in most countries, despite the health care disparity.Life expectancy, however, does not necessarily measure quality of life. Many women are still forced to undergo female genital mutilation or endure period poverty, which can lead to further mental and physical health complications.Teenagers from socially and economically marginalized communities attend a training about adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Raniganj, India.
