The spokesperson noted that \"to our knowledge\" the Students for Life activists had not obtained permits to write messages on the streets and sidewalks outside the clinic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reference to the arrests, Metro police cited a city statute that makes it\u00a0 \"unlawful\" to \"write, mark, draw, or paint\" on public property without explicit permission from city authorities.\u00a0\nAccording to the website of the District transportation department (DDOT), sidewalks are considered public space. A spokesperson for the DDOT did not answer CNA's inquiry by press time, as to whether a permit was needed to write a chalk message on the sidewalk, and if one had been requested and obtained by Students for Life of America.\nEarlier this summer, District Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered part of 16th Street, near the White House, painted with the slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" during mass anti-racism protests in the city. Protesters also painted \"Defund the Police\" on the same street as an addition to Bowser's message.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a July 20 letter to Bowser, Hawkins asked for permission to paint \"Black Pre-Born Lives Matter\" on the street outside the Planned Parenthood clinic on Aug. 1.\nHawkins argued in her letter to the mayor that it would be unlawful \"viewpoint discrimination\" if the District government painted a street with a message, and allowed protesters to paint another message, while prohibiting pro-lifers from painting their own street message.\n\"If you open the door to free speech on the city streets to one group, you can't shut it to others,\" Hawkins wrote to Bowser.\nAccording to its website, the D.C. police department has arrested 455 people in connection with mass protests this summer. Most (330) of the charges filed were curfew violations, while 57 involved \"felony rioting\" where \"tumultuous and violent conduct\" poses \"grave danger\" or commits \"serious injury to persons or serious property damage.\"\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoric \u2018Requiem for the Forgotten\u2019 Mass to premiere in Miami\u00a0\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPlanned Parenthood, \nprolife, \nWashington DC, \nStudents for Life of America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Hadro was the political editor at Catholic News Agency through October 2021.
