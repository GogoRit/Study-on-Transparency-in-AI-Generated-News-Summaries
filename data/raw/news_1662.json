Traci Blackmon speaks Thursday during a news conference in St. Louis announcing a lawsuit challenging Missouri\u2019s abortion ban (photo submittted).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Missouri lawmakers put the words \u201cAlmighty God is the author of life\u201d into the section of law stating the General Assembly\u2019s intent for abortion regulations, they crossed the line separating church and state, a lawsuit filed Thursday in St. Louis charges.\nThirteen Christian and Jewish leaders are suing the state and six elected prosecutors from most of the state\u2019s largest counties to block enforcement of the abortion ban that took effect in June after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\nThe lawsuit, filed in St. Louis Circuit Court, argues that the law violates the Missouri Constitution\u2019s provisions separating church and state.\n\u201cOur elected officials have violated their oath to uphold that constitution by weaponizing religious beliefs to deny abortion access in a state where studies prove these actions are not the will of the majority of the people,\u201d said Rev. Traci Blackmon, the lead plaintiff, speaking at a news conference Thursday.\u00a0\nBlackmon is associate general minister of justice and local church ministries for the United Church of Christ and senior pastor of Christ The King United Church of Christ in Florissant. The lawsuit is being sponsored by Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\nThe lawsuit is the first of its kind in the nation, to test an abortion ban as an invasion of religious liberty based on the provisions of a state constitution, Denise Lieberman, the Missouri attorney who worked on the petition with lawyers for the national groups, said in an interview with The Independent.\n\u201cThe underlying purpose of Missouri\u2019s abortion ban and its accompanying restrictions is unambiguously religious in nature,\u201d Lieberman said.\nIn the 83-page petition, the plaintiffs are asking the court to issue a permanent injunction blocking enforcement of the challenged law and to declare the challenged provisions of law unconstitutional.\nUnder Missouri\u2019s trigger law passed in 2019, abortions will only be permitted in cases of a medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest under the law.\u00a0\nHealth care providers who violate the law can be guilty of a class B felony, which can result in five to 15 years in prison, and have their medical license suspended or revoked.\n\u201cDuring the legislative debates over (the 2019 bill), Missouri legislators expressly stated their intent to impose on Missourians of all faiths a specifically conservative Christian, religious view about the beginning of life,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe 2019 bill passed on almost pure party line votes, with all but one legislative Republican supporting it and all but one Democrat opposed. Republicans in Jefferson City were quick to defend the law and deny that it violated the constitution.\nSenate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said he didn\u2019t think the lawsuit would succeed during his weekly legislative news conference, calling it \u201cfoolish.\u201d\nRowden, who had a career as a religious musician before entering politics, said his vote was not based on his personal religious beliefs.\n\u201cWe were acting on the belief that life is precious and should be treated as such,\u201d Rowden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a religious belief. And I think people need to understand what separation of church and state is. Most people don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe petition filed Thursday cites several times lawmakers stated during debate that they looked to their religious beliefs to inform their vote on the bill. The attorneys who filed the case listened to dozens of hours of recorded debate and committee testimony in preparation for the filing.\u00a0\n\u201cSo I had to make a decision on when I believe(d) that life was present,\u201d the lawsuit quotes from state Rep. Barry Hovis, R-Cape Girardeau. \u201cAnd being from the Biblical side of it, I\u2019ve always believed that life does occur at the point of conception.\u201d\nThe Missouri Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights has three provisions protecting religious freedom that are far more detailed than the federal constitution. The lawsuit alleges the abortion law violates the provision against an establishment of religion, the provision prohibiting the state from compelling any person to support a particular religious belief and the provision against state aid in support of any church, denomination or sect.\n\u201cThe explicit invocations of conservative Christian notions of \u2018conception\u2019 and sanctity of life in the text and legislative debate (of the trigger law) to justify banning abortion impose these particular religious beliefs on all Missourians, coercing people and faith communities with different beliefs and commitments to adhere to religious requirements of a faith that is not their own,\u201d the petition states.\nIn a statement promising a vigorous defense of the law, Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican,\u00a0 said that in a 1980 ruling on Medicaid funding for abortions, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court rejected arguments like those raised in this case, and the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s Office has won on similar claims at the Missouri Supreme Court.\u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruling is irrelevant, Lieberman said. The case will be tried based on Missouri\u2019s religious freedom provisions, and does not invoke any federal constitutional violations, Lieberman said.\n\u201cThose protections are very, very clear that the wall between church and state is high,\u201d she said, \u201cand it is not porous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLawsuit seeks to overturn Missouri abortion ban as violation of religious rights\nby Rudi Keller, Missouri Independent January 19, 2023\nLawsuit seeks to overturn Missouri abortion ban as violation of religious rights\nby Rudi Keller, Missouri Independent January 19, 2023\n When Missouri lawmakers put the words \u201cAlmighty God is the author of life\u201d into the section of law stating the General Assembly\u2019s intent for abortion regulations, they crossed the line separating church and state, a lawsuit filed Thursday in St. Louis charges.\nThirteen Christian and Jewish leaders are suing the state and six elected prosecutors from most of the state\u2019s largest counties to block enforcement of the abortion ban that took effect in June after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v.
