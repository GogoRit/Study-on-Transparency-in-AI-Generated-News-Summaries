Hear what they have to say\n\n\n                            01:21\n                        \n - Source:\n                CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlanta\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Attendees at the National Right to Life Convention had nearly filled a hotel conference room Friday for a conservative author\u2019s talk when the news broke around 10 a.m. ET. \n    \n\n            Cheers could be heard from outside the room, and a man shouted, \u201cRoe\u2019s been overturned!\u201d \n    \n\n            Inside the room, some started clapping, while others checked their phones in the minutes after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had made access to abortion a federal constitutional right. The session was derailed. Conventiongoers hugged one another, and some were visibly emotional.\n    \n\n            The moment at the annual convention this weekend for the largest anti-abortion group in the US consummated a win for which advocates had fought for decades through organizing, lobbying and voting. While the court\u2019s overturning of its historic ruling had been expected for a variety of reasons, it was a highly emotional day for people on both sides of the debate on abortion access in the United States.\n    \n\n            Many convention attendees who spoke with CNN after the ruling said they had been involved with the anti-abortion movement for years. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters, demonstrators and activists gather in front of the Supreme Court as the justices prepare to hear arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, on December 1, 2021 in Washington.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nConservative justices seized the moment and delivered the opinion they'd long promised\n\n\n\n\n            Jessica Rodgers, 33, was speaking to a group of teens attending the convention, explaining just \u201chow historic today might be\u201d as the ruling came in. A former intern with National Right to Life who\u2019s now the vice president of DC Metro Life Alliance, Rodgers said the ruling moved her to tears.\n    \n\n            \u201cTo see this barrier put up for all of these decades that have prevented states from taking necessary steps to protect human life at every level. To see that barrier fall and crash was just kind of euphoric. It was joyous,\u201d she told CNN on Friday.\n    \n\n            Carol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, said attendees would \u201cbe celebrating for the rest of the weekend.\u201d (National Right to Life did not provide the number of attendees at this year\u2019s convention.)\n    \n\n            \u201cWe are all excited,\u201d Tobias told CNN, shortly after the decision. \u201cOf course, everybody here is erupting in tears of joy that this has finally happened.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Right to Life Committee President Carol Tobias speaks at the anti-abortion group's annual convention on Friday, June 24, 2022, at Atlanta, Georgia. \n\nPanelists from left to right are:\n \nDerrick Jones, National Right to Life Chief Marketing Officer\nBenjamin Clapper, Louisiana Right to Life Executive Director\nCarol Tobias, National Right to Life President\nMatt Birk, Minnesota GOP Lt Gov. candidate and former NFL player\nBishop Peter Christensen of Idaho\nDavid Scotton, attorney\n \n\n\nVeronica Stracqualursi/CNN\n\n\n\n            Anne Carmichael, a former executive director for Missouri Right to Life, was in fifth grade when Roe was handed down. She said she had since made it her life\u2019s work to ensure the decision was overturned.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to actually get your head around it now that it\u2019s here,\u201d Carmichael said.\n    \n\n            \u201cEveryone here is elated, but it\u2019s very emotional for everybody,\u201d Carmichael said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people over the years that gave a lot of their life to this that were not able to see it. For those of us that were fortunate to do so, it is very momentous.\u201d \n    \n\n            While anti-abortion groups celebrated, abortion rights advocates expressed anger, disappointment and fear over the court\u2019s ruling and vowed to fight back. \u201cWe are angry. And we are devastated,\u201d Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, the executive director of Women\u2019s March, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a nightmare come to life, one with deadly consequences for women.\u201d\n    \n\n            Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, 38, the founder and president of the anti-abortion organization the New Wave Feminists, said she was experiencing mixed emotions.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt was such a weird conflicting cry, because it was equal parts joy that the humanity of the unborn child is being recognized but also this deep agony for all of the women in our country right now who are absolutely terrified what this decision looks like for them. Because they haven\u2019t seen states actually step up and give them something. They\u2019re only seeing stuff being taken away.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Rodgers and Herndon-De La Rosa both said the movement should focus on providing support to women.\n    \n\n            Abortion rights supporters have warned that overturning Roe won\u2019t stop women from seeking and obtaining abortions. And before the court\u2019s ruling, 66% of Americans said they did not want Roe to be completely overturned, according to CNN\u2019s most recent poll. The court\u2019s decision on Friday does not make abortion illegal nationwide.\n    \n\n            Herndon-De La Rosa said that if the demand for abortions isn\u2019t addressed, there will be an increase of women getting abortion pills in the mail or traveling across state borders to get abortions \u201cbecause we haven\u2019t actually addressed the desperation that a woman feels when she is in a crisis pregnancy.\u201d \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Nacion/Cover Images/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThese are the states where abortion rights are still protected after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade\n\n\n\n\n            With the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion, while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\u202f\u202fIn at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.\n    \n\n            Tobias of the National Right to Life Committee sees more work ahead.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe have a long battle ahead of us. Abortion is not going to be illegal because of this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThe elected officials are now going to have to determine what the laws will be at federal and state levels. There\u2019s a lot of work to do. And we need to build a culture that is pro-mom, pro-baby, pro-life. So we know that this is certainly not the end.\u201d\n    \n\n            Lynda Bell, the chair of the board of the National Right to Life Committee and President of Florida Right to Life, teared up as she described what she was feeling Friday.\n    \n\n            \u201cI can barely talk,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have waited for this for 49 years, and finally the court has recognized their egregious decision that stripped the states of the ability to protect life.\u201d \n    \n\n            She called the ruling the \u201ccorrection of a terrible, terrible decision.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWhen you fight for something for decades and it comes to fruition, it is just stunning,\u201d she told CNN.\n    \n\n            Herndon-De La Rosa recalled being 16 when she became pregnant with her son. \u201cThe fear and terror when that second line shows up is so valid and so real,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            She told CNN the only reason she now has a 21-year-old son is \u201cbecause I had a roof over my head, I had medical insurance, I had a family that was supporting me, not kicking me out in the streets.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWe have to become that community and that family to people who are going to be vulnerable to still seeking abortions even when it\u2019s no longer legal,\u201d she added.\n
