As we turned down a street in the municipality of Ilopango, my friend pointed out a looming structure \u2014 the Ilopango women\u2019s prison \u2014 where, it turns out, a number of women convicted of abortion-related crimes are incarcerated.\nEl Salvador has some of the\u00a0most draconian abortion laws\u00a0on the planet. Since 1998, the procedure has been\u00a0totally banned\u00a0\u2014 including in cases of rape and incest, or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Even having a miscarriage can land you behind bars. The charge is often \u201caggravated homicide,\u201d which can carry a sentence of\u00a0up to 50 years\u00a0(ironic considering San Salvador\u00a0is\u00a0among the world\u2019s murder capitals \u2014\u00a0you\u2019d think the police would have enough actual homicides to deal with).\nA new documentary titled\u00a0En Deuda con Todas \u2014 produced by the Galician organisation Agareso \u2014 offers a striking glimpse at the war on reproductive and human rights in El Salvador. One protagonist is Teodora V\u00e1squez, released from prison in 2018 after her 30-year sentence was commuted to ten. Her crime? \u201cKilling\u201d her newborn by fainting during labor. She was awaiting the arrival of an ambulance and awoke to find her baby dead.\nThen there\u2019s 26-year-old Sara Rogel, a chipper, ponytailed inmate at a prison in the Salvadoran department of Sonsonate, who is six years and four months into her own three-decade sentence for \u201caggravated homicide\u201d \u2014 this one for slipping and falling in her home while pregnant. Requiring urgent medical attention, Rogel recounts how the police showed up and attempted to handcuff her before the surgeon was even done.\n\nIn fact, medics are\u00a0frequently the ones\u00a0to alert Salvadoran law enforcement to obstetrical complications potentially qualifying as prosecutable offenses. Failure to do so can mean violating the Salvadoran constitution \u2014\u00a0Article 1 of the document recognises human life as beginning from the very moment of conception.\nAnother interviewee in the film is Xiomara Argueta, a Salvadoran OBGYN who suffered sudden complications during her own pregnancy and knew that her baby wouldn\u2019t survive \u2014 and that she wouldn\u2019t either, if the medical personnel attending to her abided by Salvadoran law. But she had an out: \u201cIn my country,\u201d Argueta humbly acknowledges, \u201cwomen with money don\u2019t go to jail.\u201d\nAs in the United States, where the wealthy are able to skirt abortion restrictions, Salvadoran women with access to the proper resources can either have the procedure performed at private clinics in the country, travel abroad to abort, or obtain abortion pills. According to figures I received from a Salvadoran feminist activist, an in-country abortion can cost up to $1,200, and pills are similarly expensive \u2014 plenty of families survive on $200 a month or less.\nWomen stand chained together outside the Supreme Court in San Salvador, May 2013, during a protest in support of a 22-year-old woman identified as Beatriz who requested an abortion because she suffers from lupus.

The effective institutionalisation of sexual violence against women \u2014 and the rape stigma that, as in any patriarchal society, hits women rather than men \u2014 also means that rapists frequently enjoy impunity for their crimes while women are punished for, you know, miscarrying. For many poor women who are not keen on reproduction, the only options are unsafe (i.e. potentially lethal) abortions or suicide. Perhaps the Salvadoran state can begin prosecuting female corpses for aggravated homicide of embryos.\nThe state\u2019s crusade against reproductive rights has plenty of institutional support. The Catholic Church \u2014 among other powerful religious forces in El Salvador \u2014 vouches for the morality of the barbaric campaign. Politicians, too, are ready with anti-abortion sound bites \u2014 like Congresswoman Karla Hern\u00e1ndez of the right-wing ARENA party, who\u00a0swears that\u00a0women\u2019s bodies are \u201cprogrammed like computers to give birth\u201d and that cancer and other maladies will proliferate if abortion is permitted. The left-leaning FMLN has also been bad on the issue, doing nothing in its ten years in power (2009\u20132019) to reverse the abortion ban.\nIn\u00a0En Deuda con Todas, Hern\u00e1ndez asserts that \u201cthe trauma of rape can\u2019t be resolved with the trauma of an abortion.\u201d In my own\u00a0experience, I\u2019d say abortion ranks among the most relief-filled decisions of my entire life \u2014 though I\u2019d imagine spending decades in prison for either voluntarily or involuntarily dispensing with a clump of cells in my womb would be pretty traumatic.\nAlso read: Rape Survivors\u2019 Right to Abortion: Are Doctors Listening?\nThere have been a few relative victories on the abortion rights front in El Salvador, as when 21-year-old Evelyn Hern\u00e1ndez was acquitted\u00a0last year of \u201caggravated homicide\u201d for delivering a stillborn baby after being raped by a gang member. Granted, this was after she had spent\u00a0nearly three years\u00a0in prison.\nAs Salvadoran human rights defender\u00a0Morena Herrera notes, the criminalisation of women continues to amount to \u201cstate violence.\u201d Which brings us back to the previous point: in such a violent state \u2014 where homicides, forced\u00a0disappearances, extrajudicial\u00a0assassinations\u00a0by state security forces, and ongoing impunity for slaughter conducted during El Salvador\u2019s brutal civil war of 1980\u20131992 are a daily reality \u2014 this sort of ultra-policing of women\u2019s bodies comes off as ludicrous and illogical.\nThen again, perhaps distraction is precisely the point. If the patriarchal state has no interest in protecting its citizens from the moment of conception, it might as well blame poor women for the oversight.\nBut that, in itself, is one colossal crime.\nBel\u00e9n Fern\u00e1ndez is the author of The Imperial Messenger: Thomas Friedman at Work, Marytrs Never Die: Travels through South Lebanon, and, most recently, Exile: Rejecting America and Finding the World.
