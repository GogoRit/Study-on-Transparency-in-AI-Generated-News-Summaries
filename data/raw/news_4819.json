Wade\u2019s Norma McCorvey called her just days before she died.\nThe post comes in response to the FX Documentary AKA Jane Roe, which claims that McCorvey pretended to be pro-life for money.\nThe former Planned Parenthood clinic director-turned pro-life advocate explained that McCorvey carried a heavy burden: 60 million abortions. She said McCorvey called her because Johnson knows the weight of \u201ca big number.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the post below:\n\nClick here if you cannot see the post above.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the full text of Johnson\u2019s post:\n\u201cI spoke to Norma McCorvey days before her death. It was the only time we had ever spoken. An unexpected call and a number I didn\u2019t recognize, I almost didn\u2019t answer. I am so thankful that I did.\n\u201cThere was no long introduction. No formalities. She told me that she called because she needed to talk to someone else who had a \u2018big number\u2019 and would understand what she needed to ask me.\n\u201cYes, I have a \u2018big number.\u2019 Twenty-two thousand. \n\u201cBut it was a drop in the bucket compared to the burden that she felt. My number was just part of \u201cher number.\u201d Because she felt like she owned EVERY number.\n\u201cShe owned my 22,000. She felt like she owned them all. Every abortion that had been committed under the law that bore her name\u2026\u201dJane Roe\u201d\u2026they were \u201chers.\u201d\n\u201cI know what my burden of 22,000 feels like and it\u2019s heavy. Some days, especially in the beginning, it was debilitating.\n\u201cAnd yes, God forgives. Yes, you know that. Yes, you believe that. But you don\u2019t forget. You never forget what you have done. Most days you don\u2019t want to forget what you have done because those memories are what keep you motivated to fight for justice.\n\u201cBut SOME days, you drink a bottle of wine and you pretend that you spent those years working as an accountant or a hair stylist or something else, anything else, besides what you really were. And that\u2019s when your number is 22,000.\n\u201cNow imagine 50 million. 60 million.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the burden that Norma carried. A self-imposed burden that she could not shake\u2026that she carried with her until the day of her death.\n\u201cShe was a fragile woman\u2013a woman whose life was riddled with heartache. She was shamelessly used by the abortion industry at a young age.\n\u201cShe was a vulnerable target for them and that\u2019s who they prey on. No one reading this can even understand the mental state of a woman tormented by that burden\u2026especially in the last year of her life.\n\u201cWere there mistakes made when Norma joined the pro-life movement? I\u2019m sure there were.\n\u201c\u2018Jane Roe\u2019 joining the pro-life cause was certainly unexpected and I think people didn\u2019t know what to do with her. I\u2019m not sure people truly saw or understood the tremendous burden she carried when she first left.\n\u201cI do know this. Of all of the people who claimed to be friends with Norma McCorvey, the one I saw who loved her completely was Fr. Frank Pavone.\n\u201cListen to his opinion of this nonsense. Listen to his perspective.\n\u201cI have a personal and private story of a time I saw Fr. Frank put his life on hold to care for Norma in her time of need. He journeyed with her into the Catholic Church. He watched her place all of her faith into the loving arms of Christ.\n\u201cHe truly saw her as Norma McCorvey, not Jane Roe. He loved her well.\n\u201cThere is a reason that HE was not asked to be in this recent documentary. If he would have been involved, the entire thing would have crumbled.\n\u201cHe knew the real Norma. And he knew the sincerity of her conversion.\n\u201cHer many years as a dedicated pro-life advocate was not a lie. \n\u201cHer tearful conversation (which I will keep private) with me days before her death was not a lie.\n\u201cThe hours she spent praying in front of abortion facilities was not a lie. Her life with Christ was not a lie.\n\u201cTHE ABORTION INDUSTRY IS A LIE.\n\u201cThey lied about and manipulated her so many years ago, they did it right before her death, and they are even doing it after her death.\n\u201cThey are the lie.\u201d\nPray for the soul of Norma McCorvey!\n[See also: New Film Says Norma McCorvey Pretended to be Pro-Life for Money, Fr.
