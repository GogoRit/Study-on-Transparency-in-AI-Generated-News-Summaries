She was always full of life and was also a role model to her nine-year-old daughter Maja. Her death shook our family,\u201d Skrobol told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cWhen she got pregnant again, the news made all of us very happy. But 22 weeks into her pregnancy, Poland\u2019s new abortion law dictated the course of her life,\u201d she added.\nPoland has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. In October 2020, the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortion due to foetal defects was unconstitutional.\nThe court added that pregnancies could be terminated only in cases of rape, incest or if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. This legislation was ratified by the Polish government in January 2021.\nIzabela Sajbor became one of the first known victims of this de facto abortion ban and Skrobol has been lobbying hard for justice. She is also keen to ensure that no other woman endures a similar experience as her sister-in-law.\nSkrobol shows a picture of Izabela on her phone [Valeria Mongelli/Al Jazeera]\nSpeaking at a public hearing on Poland\u2019s abortion law at the European Parliament in Brussels on November 17, Skrobol described Izabela\u2019s last moments at the hospital in Pszczyna.\n\u201cWe were not let to visit her but received text messages from her saying the doctors were waiting for her fetus\u2019s heartbeat to stop,\u201d Skrobol said, adding that the doctors were following Poland\u2019s abortion law of not terminating a pregnancy due to foetal issues.\n\u201cIza knew her life was in danger but was keen to live for her family. Just hours before she died, her last text message said: \u2018Women are being treated as incubators\u2019,\u201d\u00a0Skrobol\u00a0said.\nShe summoned the European Union to take a tougher stance on the matter so that stringent laws do not continue shaping women\u2019s lives in Poland.\nWidespread protests\nIzabela\u2019s death sparked widespread protests in Poland with women condemning the abortion law. Since her death, many have also become apprehensive about becoming pregnant.\nAccording to an October 2022 report by the Polish newspaper Dziennik Gazeta, 52 percent of Poles believe the new abortion rules have made them less keen to have children. This is a 45 percent rise from last year.\nKamila Ferenc, lawyer at the Warsaw-based Foundation for Women and Family Planning (FEDERA), told Al Jazeera that since Poland\u2019s restrictive family planning act was introduced in 1993, women have not been guaranteed their reproductive rights.\n\u201cThe strong position of the Catholic Church has stigmatised abortion and our conservative government ratifying the October 2020 abortion legislation has made it very hard for many women. Even accessing contraceptives is hard,\u201d Ferenc told Al Jazeera.\nShe highlighted that since the October 2020 legislation came into force, more than 70,000 Polish women have been affected and six women have died the same way as Izabela, as doctors refused to terminate their pregnancies.\n\u201cThe case is against the doctors as well, because by not providing medical services when needed, they are neglecting the patient\u2019s life,\u201d Ferenc said.\n\nWhile she is aware that some doctors are not carrying out abortions when needed due to fear of getting caught by government authorities, her organisation is trying to cooperate with them and help them.\n\u201cWe organise workshops for them and try to change their attitude by making them aware of how brutal the government\u2019s rules are, and how they as doctors should prioritise saving a person\u2019s life over following a discriminatory law out of fear,\u201d Ferenc said.\nEU\u2019s stance\nThe European Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, has criticised the Polish abortion law.\nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution in November 2021, calling on Warsaw to lift the de facto ban that threatens women\u2019s lives.\nAt a hearing in the European Parliament in Brussels this week, Polish politician Robert Biedron, who is also the chair of the European Parliament\u2019s Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality Committee, reported on a recent visit to Poland.\n\u201cWe met many women, NGOs supporting pregnant women in need, government leaders and opposition party members. Under the current situation, access to legal abortion is still very limited,\u201d he told reporters at a news conference at the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\u201cIt is important for the EU to call on Poland to lift this ban and also ensure that every EU nation gives women the right to undergo abortions. This should be a part of the bloc\u2019s strategy on health and reproductive rights,\u201d Biedron added.\nUkrainian refugees\nBiedron also pointed out that the European Parliament\u2019s delegation met several Ukrainian refugee women in Poland, who are also subject to the abortion ban.\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, millions of Ukrainians have fled to neighbouring Poland and other EU nations.\nPoland\u2019s strict abortion rules have come as a brutal surprise to Ukrainian women, according to Ferenc.\n\u201cThese women were used to a more liberal abortion legislation in Ukraine, and now, they are surprised that in Poland, which on one hand is giving them shelter, is not letting them exercise their fundamental reproductive rights on the other hand,\u201d Ferenc told Al Jazeera, adding that they have not protested against the law but are instead \u201csuffering in silence\u201d.\nAnother challenge for Ukrainian women is how Polish law deals with abortion after rape. While abortion is allowed, women have to be able to prove they have been raped.\n\u201cThis is already difficult for Polish women and will be even harder for Ukrainian women. But we at FEDERA help them get a certificate from a prosecutor,\u201d Urszula Grycuk, the organisation\u2019s coordinator for international advocacy, told Al Jazeera.\nTo support Ukrainian women further, Biedron told Al Jazeera that the EU should consider including a clause to let them seek abortion services freely in every EU country as a part of the bloc\u2019s temporary protection directive, which gives Ukrainians the right to live and avail medical care, work opportunities and education till 2024 in the EU.\n\u2018Let women protest\u2019\nCaroline Hickson, regional director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation European Network, highlighted the importance of protecting women\u2019s rights to protest as the global battle to have abortion bans lifted magnifies with women protesting not only Poland\u2019s laws but also more recently, the US\u2019s abortion laws.\n\u201cMany women like Marta Lempart, who are leading the Polish women\u2019s strike, have been slapped with charges for protesting the government\u2019s laws. The right to peacefully protest needs to be protected in the EU because it can make a difference as it has in countries like Ireland,\u201d she said at the European Parliament hearing.\n\u201cIf it is not protected, more women will die and we will be here at a hearing again in 10 years,\u201d she added.\nSkrobol shared a similar view.\n\u201cIzabela\u2019s daughter Maja takes her school artwork and a teddy bear and goes to visit her mother\u2019s grave every single day,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLet us not take away wives from their husbands and mothers from their children and continue fighting for our rights,\u201d Skrobol added.\n\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
