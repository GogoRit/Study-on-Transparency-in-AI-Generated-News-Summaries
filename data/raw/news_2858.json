Authorities do not know how the fetuses were obtained or how they got into the home where anti-abortion activist Lauren Handy was staying before she was arrested. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jonah McKeown \n\nDenver Newsroom, Apr 1, 2022 / 16:41 pm\nPolice on Wednesday found the remains of at least five aborted fetuses at the Washington, D.C. home of activist Lauren Handy, who is affiliated with the group Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, a secular organization that demonstrates against abortion.\u00a0\nThough it is not immediately clear who has legal responsibility for the remains, PAAU says a member of their group \u201c\u200b\u200bprivately arranged\u201d for police to pick up the remains for \u201cforensic examination,\u201d fearing that the babies were aborted illegally.\u00a0\nMetropolitan police said they searched the home March 30 following a tip on potential \u201cbiohazard material.\u201d The unborn children, who police said were \u201caborted in accordance with D.C. law,\u201d were collected by Washington\u2019s medical examiner and the investigation into how the remains ended up in the apartment is ongoing, police said.\u00a0\nPAAU is a relatively new group created and led by Terrisa Bukovinac, the founder and president of Pro-Life San Francisco and former president of Democrats For Life.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNA contacted PAAU to ask why and how the remains were being stored at Handy\u2019s home and who has legal responsibility for the remains, among other questions. CNA was informed that the group does not plan to comment publicly until a press conference set to be held April 5.\u00a0\nHowever, an online statement from PAAU says that the fetuses came from \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d and that the group believes that the babies may have been aborted in violation of federal laws against partial-birth abortion and infanticide.\u00a0\nThey said the \u201cwhistleblowers who received the fetuses\u201d will be present at the Tuesday press conference. At least five fetuses were recovered by the police, though PAAU hinted that they have more fetuses in their possession that have not been turned over to police.\u00a0\n\u201cTheir late gestational ages as well as their apparent sustained injuries potentially show violations of the Partial Birth Abortion Act as well as the Born Alive Infants Protection Act which are federal crimes,\u201d the statement says.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe group also said that a funeral Mass and \u201cnaming ceremony\u201d for the fetuses was held. PAAU has not yet commented on whether it will be possible for the fetuses to be given a dignified burial.\nHandy is a Catholic convert who has been involved in pro-life activism, including sidewalk counseling to encourage women not to enter abortion clinics, for several years.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2017 report from EWTN Pro-life Weekly shows Handy praying the Divine Mercy Chaplet and the rosary outside a clinic, and lauding the \u201cpower of prayer\u201d in helping women reconsider getting an abortion. That year she said she had saved \u201cclose to 500\u201d babies from abortion through her encounters with women at abortion clinics, and had been arrested several times for her activism.\u00a0\nHandy was, along with eight other protestors, charged this week for apparent violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act during a protest at the Washington Surgi-Center abortion clinic in 2020, which one of the protestors streamed live on Facebook.\u00a0\nThe FACE Act prohibits the obstruction, intimidation, or injury of those seeking abortion, though it expressly does not prohibit peaceful protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice charged the protestors with conspiracy against rights, and with violations of the FACE Act, following Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s vow to enforce the FACE Act in September 2021. At issue, according to the DOJ, was the protestors' use of \u201ctheir bodies, furniture, chains and ropes\u201d to \u201cblockade\u201d the clinic doors.\u00a0\nIf convicted, the protestors could each face up to 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fines of $350,000, prosecutors said.\nAhead of PAAU\u2019s October 2021 launch, Bukovinac explained to CNA that her group is \u201can uprising of grassroots activists\u201d who are \u201clooking to organize blue cities across America\u201d against abortion. She said she opted for the phrase \u201canti-abortion\u201d in the group\u2019s name, instead of \u201cpro-life,\u201d because \u201cIn more left-leaning circles, sometimes the phrase \u2018pro-life\u2019 has become a little meaningless.\u201d\nBukovinac has described the group as \u201ca single-issue organization\u2026we are opposed to abortion.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nBukovinac, an atheist, said another goal of PAAU is to highlight the existence of pro-life activists who do not consider themselves religious or right-leaning; she has written on non-religious reasons to oppose abortion.\u00a0\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nprolife, \nProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, \nLauren Handy, \nD.C.
