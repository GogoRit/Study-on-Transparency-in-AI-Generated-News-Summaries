The US-facing site is currently out of stock of both the McLaren Limited Edition and Vive Pro Starter Kit; he full Vive Pro Kit is no longer available there.\nPriced at \u20ac1,219 (\u00a31,119), the Vive Pro Full Kit includes the headset itself, two SteamVR 2.0 base stations, two \u2018wand\u2019 style controllers, and all the necessary cabling to get you into PC VR. Besides a download code for Half-Life: Alyx, the offer also includes two free months of Viveport Infinity, the company\u2019s Netflix-style game download service.\nThe deal is also available through online retailers such as\u00a0Scan, Overclockers, Curry\u2019s PC World, Ebuyer,\u00a0Box.co.uk, and Amazon.\nSEE ALSOHTC Reveals Vive Proton, a Compact Standalone VR Headset Prototype\nFirst launched back in 2018, Vive Pro is now being discontinued in favor of the newer Vive Pro Eye, a version of the headset with integrated Tobii eye-tracking. Vive Pro notably upped the resolution of the original 2016-era Vive and included the ergonomic audio headstrap as a standard feature.\nEarlier this year HTC permanently reduced the price of Vive Pro to $600 (or local equivalent), which includes only the headset. With that, it\u2019s possible we\u2019re seeing the last Vive Pro stocks dwindle as Vive Cosmos and Vive Pro Eye take its place as the company\u2019s flagship headsets.\nHTC Vive Pro Specs\n\nDisplay \u2013 Dual AMOLED 3.5\u2033 diagonal\nResolution \u2013 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye (2880 x 1600 pixels combined)\nRefresh rate \u2013 90 Hz\nField of view \u2013 110 degrees\nAudio \u2013 Hi-Res certificate headphones (removable), High impedance headphones support\nInput \u2013 Integrated microphones\nConnections \u2013 Bluetooth, USB-C port for peripherals\nSensors \u2013 SteamVR Tracking, G-sensor, gyroscope, proximity, Eye Comfort Setting (IPD)\nErgonomics \u2013 Eye relief with lens distance adjustment, Adjustable Eye Comfort Setting (IPD), Adjustable headphones, Adjustable headstrap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for Signing Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease correct the marked field(s) below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,true,6,Contact Email,2\n\n\n\nRoad to VR - Daily Roundup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article may contain affiliate links.

He has been professionally reporting on the space for nearly a decade as Editor at Road to VR, authoring more than 3,500 articles on the topic. Scott brings that seasoned insight to his reporting from major industry events across the globe.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmfx\n\n\n\nI thought their vive pro was for pro market, free Half-life game bundle doesn\u2019t sound like pro bundle.\nWith such a price, such an old hardware (and still those crappy wand controllers), even if it features a integrated 200 dollars eye tracking, is a rip off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ilbaize\n\n\n\nincredible pricing !  incredible  offer ! incredibly\u2026insane  !\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoneWuff326\n\n\n\nValve Index   vs    Htc Vive Pro\nFOV     130                      110\nRes      1440\u00d71600             1440\u00d71600\nRefre    120hz                       90hz\nTrackin  Base sta 2         Base sta 1\ncontrol  Knuckles            Wands\nJust get the index the extra 100 dollars are worth it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmersive Computing\n\n\n\nField of view is not 130 degree on index? (Would be great) it\u2019s heavily dependent on eye relief which is determined by craniofacial anthropometry (i.e. your face and head). Personally I found the Vive Pro more comfortable than my index. \nI\u2019m getting slightly more vertical, and about the same horizontally on my index than my Vive, albeit with less stereo overlap. I used the thinnest face cushion on Vive, am using 3D printed wide face gasket on Index. \nSomething the Vive Pro is better for is darker scenes, the Index doesn\u2019t handle dark scenes\u2026at all well. \nI\u2019ve had to refund several games that were unplayable on Index due to its LCD display, the most recent \u201cGloomy Eyes\u201d which looked great on Vive Pro Eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSven Viking\n\n\n\n(Base station version, that is. Both come with 2 base stations.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmfx\n\n\n\nRes 1440\u00d71600 for both\u2026 actually even here the vice pro loose because it\u2019s real rgb pixel on the index and crap pentile on the Vive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArSh\n\n\n\nVive Pro is OLED, Index is crap LCD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArSh\n\n\n\nYou can get the Vive Pro headset, Index basestations, Index controllers (which includes HL:Alyx) for only \u00a320 more than the \u201cfull\u201d Pro kit which has the old wand controllers\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob\n\n\n\nNeed StarVR one for that! ;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTonyVT SkarredGhost\n\n\n\nI admit I don\u2019t understand this move. The Pro should be for prosumers and enterprises\u2026 IMHO they should have offered free assitance, or Vive Events for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39,929FansLike13,574FollowersFollow66,541FollowersFollow27,800SubscribersSubscribe  \n\n\n\n\nLatest Headlines\n\n\n\n\nNew VR Publisher Unveils \u2018VRIDER\u2019 Superbike Racing Game, Coming to Quest and PC VR\n\nMar 19, 2024 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHTC is Giving Devs a Big Revenue Share Boost on Its VR Platform\n\nMar 18, 2024 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2018Escape Simulator\u2019 is Bringing 8-player Co-op Escape Rooms to VR Next Month in Free Update\n\nMar 18, 2024 \n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nFeatures & Reviews\n\n\n\n\nWhat Any VR Game Can Learn From the \u2018Electronauts\u2019 Interface \u2013 Inside XR Design\n\nMar 18, 2024 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhy \u201cEmbodiment\u201d is More Important Than \u201cImmersion\u201d \u2013 Inside XR Design\n\nMar 14, 2024 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVision Pro Preview: Early Thoughts on My Time Inside Apple\u2019s First Headset\n\nFeb 1, 2024 \n\n\n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
