(The foundation paid out $5.5 billion in all grants over the same period, meaning that most of its donations went to support abortion or birth control groups.)\nOf that $4 billion, the Buffett Foundation paid about $675 million to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its international and state-level affiliates from 2000 to 2018. Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of abortions in the United States. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion think tank affiliated with Planned Parenthood, received over $112 million from the Buffett Foundation.\nIn that same period, the foundation paid $293 million to the National Abortion Federation, the coalition of abortion providers that supports loosened restrictions on abortion.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s \u201cMalthusian Dread\u201d\nSo what is the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation?\nAs InfluenceWatch explains, it was created in 1964 by famed investor and billionaire Warren Buffett as the Buffett Foundation, but was renamed in the early 2000s after his late wife, Susan Thompson Buffett.\nFrom the start, the foundation\u2019s goal was population control\u2014what a biographer has called Warren Buffett\u2019s \u201cMalthusian dread\u201d of overpopulation among the world\u2019s poor. (Prior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in America, Buffett and his business partner Charles Munger operated a fake church that helped women reach abortion clinics where it was legal.)\nThe foundation received another influx of $2.5 billion from Susan Thompson Buffett\u2019s estate after her death to continue its pro-abortion activities. And Warren Buffett continues to directly fund it himself, gifting the foundation $259 million in 2018 alone.\nBillions for Abortion\nGynuity Health Projects is another key group, which received $36 million from the Buffett Foundation. As I\u2019ve recently written, Gynuity is a New York LLC-turned-nonprofit that conducts horrifying experiments on women in Burkina Faso, a destitute country in West Africa. The group provides mail-order abortion drugs in the U.S. designed to induce a miscarriage in the first trimester. The drugs being tested in Africa would extend that to the second trimester, effectively enabling at-home abortion of fetuses up to 28 weeks old.\nThe Buffett Foundation paid out $365 million to Ipas, a major abortion provider in poor nations that also lobbies against the so-called Global Gag Rule\u2014the ban on federal funding of groups that provide abortions overseas. The ban, known to supporters as the Mexico City Policy, was instituted by President Ronald Reagan. It has since been rescinded by every Democratic president since and reinstated by each subsequent Republican president up through President Donald Trump in 2017.\nThe foundation also gave $48 million to Pathfinder International, which I\u2019ve documented as another major group trying to overturn the Mexico City Policy. Pathfinder spent $1 billion over the past decade pushing population control policies overseas\u2014with $972 million in funding from your tax dollars.\nSimilarly, the foundation granted an incredible $441 million to Marie Stopes International, another major abortion provider in the Third World. The Buffett Foundation is easily one of the biggest\u2014perhaps the biggest\u2014donor to Marie Stopes. In 2017, the abortion group reported revenues of $62 million. That same year, the Buffett Foundation poured $56 million into Marie Stopes.\nAnother major recipient is EngenderHealth, with $91 million in Buffett Foundation grants. EngenderHealth, founded in 1937 as the Sterilization League of New Jersey, provides abortions in poor countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\nThe foundation has paid an impressive $223 million to DKT International, a pro-abortion nonprofit that sells cheap birth control to the Third World. The group is chaired by Philip Harvey, founder of the mail-order erotica company Adam & Eve.\nNotably, the Buffett Foundation gave $42.5 million to Catholic pro-abortion groups, including Catholics for Choice based in Washington, DC, and Cat\u00f3licas por el Derecho a Decidir, its Latin American affiliate. The group lobbies against the pro-life movement and has been denounced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as taking positions contrary to Roman Catholic teaching.\nOther Notable Grant Recipients\nThe list of Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation grant recipients is available here. Other notables include:\n\nPopulation Services International: $416 million\nNARAL Pro-Choice America and state affiliates: $31 million\nNational Network of Abortion Funds: $11.4 million\nNational Partnership for Women and Families: $11 million\nNational Women\u2019s Law Center: $27.1 million\nPhysicians for Reproductive Choice and Health: $28 million\nPopulation Council: $46 million\nPopulation Reference Bureau: $13 million\nSociety of Family Planning (and its research arm): $76 million\nWorld Health Organization: $17 million\n\nSee our profile at InfluenceWatch.org for more on the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and other major funders of the pro-choice movement.\n\nHayden Ludwig\n\nHayden Ludwig is the Director of Policy Research at Restoration of America.
