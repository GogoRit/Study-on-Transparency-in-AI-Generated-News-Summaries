Wade. Governor Stitt and Attorney General O\u2019Connor were joined by Secretary of Health and Mental Health Kevin Corbett.\n\u201cI am thrilled that Attorney General John O\u2019Connor certified the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to ban abortion in Oklahoma,\u201d said Gov. Stitt. \u201cWhen I ran for governor, I promised Oklahomans that I would sign every pro-life bill that came across my desk. I am thrilled to have kept that promise to get us to where we are today and I am proud to be called America\u2019s most pro-life governor.\u201d\nImmediately following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Attorney General O\u2019Connor certified that Roe and Casey were overruled, banning abortion in Oklahoma.\n\u201cMy first major act as Oklahoma\u2019s Attorney General was to urge the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn their decisions in Roe and Casey,\u201d Attorney General O\u2019Connor said. \u201cToday, in an historic opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court did just that.\u00a0 After almost 50 years, and after the deaths of over 60 million children in America, the U.S. Supreme Court finally returned policy making on this life and death issue to the people.\u00a0 I am grateful the Court demonstrated the courage to issue this landmark decision in the face of an unprecedented campaign of violence and intimidation.\u201d\nThe press conference can be watched here.\nAdditional background:\nOklahoma\u2019s \u201ctrigger law\u201d was enacted last year (SB 612) and amended this year. Pursuant to this amended trigger law, the Oklahoma Attorney General has the duty of determining whether the U.S. Supreme Court has overruled in whole or in part Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, such that the State of Oklahoma may enforce Section 861 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes or enact a similar statute prohibiting abortion throughout pregnancy. Section 861 is a 1910 law that makes intentionally performing an abortion on a woman a felony, punishable up to five years in prison, unless it is \u201cnecessary to preserve her life.\u201d\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Attorney General John O\u2019Connor certified that Roe and Casey have been overruled. That immediately put into effect Oklahoma\u2019s trigger law, which also means\u2014because the Attorney General certified it\u2014that Section 861\u2019s total criminal ban on abortion throughout pregnancy can be enforced because state officials were never actually enjoined from enforcing it; rather, it was merely declared unconstitutional under Roe.\nSimply put, Section 861 prohibits abortion in the short term, and Senate Bill 612, passed this year, will become the primary prohibition once the law takes effect on August 25, 2022. Until then, civil penalties could likely be obtained throughout pregnancy under House Bill 4327, which includes exceptions for rape and incest, and became effective May 25, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Modified on\n      Jun 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Back to Top\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  Back to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Governor J.
