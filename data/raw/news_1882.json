Beatriz was diagnosed with a high-risk pregnancy at 11 weeks, when an ultrasound showed the fetus to be anencephalic, a congenital malformation with no prognosis for survival outside the womb. If a woman with an anencephalic pregnancy is forced to carry the fetus to term, it can lead to multiple complications, including obstetrical hemorrhage.\nThe Medical Committee of El Salvador\u2019s national maternity hospital recommended terminating the pregnancy. But in El Salvador, abortion is illegal in all circumstances, even when the pregnant woman\u2019s life, health, and personal integrity are at risk, or the fetus has serious complications incompatible with life outside of the womb.\nThrough a lengthy process, Beatriz requested the termination of her pregnancy and took her case to the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled she could not have an abortion. On April 29, 2013, the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) noted that Beatriz had a high-risk pregnancy and called on El Salvador to carry out the \u201cnecessary measures to implement the treatment\u201d recommended by the Medical Committee.\nHowever, El Salvador failed to comply, prompting the Inter-American Court to adopt provisionary measures and on June 3, Beatriz underwent an emergency C-section. The anencephalic fetus died five hours later.\nIn January 2022, the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights sent the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, alleging that El Salvador violated Beatriz\u2019s rights to life and health, to be free from inhumane treatment, and to privacy, equality before the law, and judicial guarantees and protection, under the American Convention on Human Rights. The Inter-American Commission also reiterated that the absolute criminalization of abortion exposes women to dangerous and even lethal practices that put their health and lives at risk, noting that women who are poor and most vulnerable are disproportionately affected.\nDespite the Inter-American Commission\u2019s recommendations, El Salvador continues to criminalize abortion in all circumstances. Women have been convicted of homicide for having an abortion, sometimes with sentences of up to 40 years in prison. In some cases, having a miscarriage or stillbirth was used as evidence to convict them. The Inter-American Court has already ruled that El Salvador was responsible for the death of Manuela, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 for aggravated homicide after suffering an obstetric emergency that resulted in her losing her pregnancy.\nAccess to safe and legal abortion protects autonomy and reduces maternal mortality and morbidity. Authoritative interpretations of international human rights law establish that denying women, girls, and other pregnant people access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. These include the rights to life and to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; liberty; health and information; privacy and bodily autonomy and integrity; deciding the number and spacing of children; enjoying the benefits of scientific progress; and freedom of conscience and religion.\nUnited Nations human rights treaty bodies regularly call for governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases and, at minimum, to ensure access to safe, legal abortion in certain circumstances.\nLatin American countries such as Uruguay, Argentina, and Colombia, and some states in Mexico, currently recognize access to abortion services as a human right, and some have legalized the procedure in the last three years. Meanwhile, other countries, such as Chile and Ecuador, have taken steps forward in decriminalizing abortion in cases such as rape, fetal unviability, and when the life of the pregnant woman is at risk.\n\u201cEl Salvador needs to fulfill its obligations to respect and protect human rights, including reproductive rights,\u201d Quijano Carrasco said. \u201cEl Salvador should decriminalize abortion and ensure women and pregnant people\u2019s access to safe and legal abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAmericas El Salvador \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nEcuador's Uptick in Violence Heightens Risks for Schoolchildren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nWomen with Disabilities are Rights Holders, Not Passive Recipients of Care \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWe Must Ask for What Is Already Ours\u201d\n\n\nAfro-descendant Women and Access to Land in Alto Mira y Frontera, Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 14, 2021\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWhy Do They Want to Make Me Suffer Again?\u201d\n\n\nThe Impact of Abortion Prosecutions in Ecuador \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nEcuador's Uptick in Violence Heightens Risks for Schoolchildren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nWomen with Disabilities are Rights Holders, Not Passive Recipients of Care \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIsrael Not Complying with World Court Order in Genocide Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
