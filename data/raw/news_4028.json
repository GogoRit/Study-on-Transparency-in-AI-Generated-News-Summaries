He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n      \n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court announced on Friday that it will hear Trump v. Pennsylvania and Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, two consolidated cases examining the Trump administration\u2019s rules allowing virtually any employer to deny birth control coverage to its employees.\nThe cases reignite a legal conflict over the rights of employers who object to contraception on religious grounds. This conflict raged throughout much of the Obama administration, then briefly simmered down after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death temporarily stripped conservatives of the Supreme Court majority they needed to expand the rights of religious employers.\nThe core question in the Pennsylvania cases, however, is not whether the Constitution gives such religious objectors a right to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees. Rather, it\u2019s whether the Trump administration acted properly when it wrote a sweeping exemption into regulations requiring employers to include birth control coverage in employee health plans.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s rules permit many employers to ignore the requirement to provide birth control coverage to their employees if the employer expresses either a religious or a \u201cmoral\u201d objection to contraception. A federal appeals court struck down these rules.\nHow we got here\nUntil fairly recently, the general rule in \u201creligious liberty\u201d cases was that people of faith may sometimes seek exemptions from laws they object to on religious grounds, but they could not claim an exemption that would undercut the rights of a third party. This was especially true in the business context. As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Lee (1982), \u201cwhen followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.\u201d\nThat changed with Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), which held that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) allows many employers that object to birth control to offer health plans that do not include contraceptive coverage. \nYet while Hobby Lobby was a doctrinal earthquake \u2014 erasing the old rule that religious objectors may not undercut the rights of people who do not share their beliefs \u2014 the opinion itself was fairly limited in scope. Much of the Court\u2019s reasoning rested on the fact that, rather than requiring all employers to provide birth control coverage directly to their employees, the Obama administration could have achieved the same goal more indirectly.\nUnder this indirect approach, an employer could \u201cself-certify that it opposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services.\u201d After this happens, the government could then make a separate arrangement with the company that runs that employer\u2019s health plan to ensure the employer\u2019s workers still receive contraceptive coverage.\nYet after the Obama administration took up the Supreme Court on its suggestion that it use this more indirect method of providing birth control coverage, some religious employers objected to this indirect process as well. That kicked off a second round of litigation that ultimately fizzled in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Zubik v. Burwell (2016).\nShort one justice, the Court punted Zubik back to the lower courts \u2014 most likely because the justices were divided 4-4 on who should prevail.\nThe Trump administration gave the religious right all it asked the courts for and more\nPresident Trump\u2019s election, and the appointment of archconservative Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court\u2019s vacant seat, seemed to ensure that conservatives would prevail as soon as a case like Zubik reached the justices again.\nRather than wait for such a decision, however, the Trump administration decided to act on its own to give religious objectors a broad exemption from the requirement to provide birth control coverage. In May 2017, Trump issued an executive order instructing his administration to \u201cconsider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate.\u201d \nA few months later, the administration pushed out new rules granting a broad exemption to employers with moral or religious objections to birth control. Among other things, these rules exempt both nonprofit employers and for-profit employers that are not publicly traded, if those employers object \u201cbased on its sincerely held moral convictions\u201d to contraception.\nLast July, however, a federal appeals court struck down the Trump administration\u2019s rules. The court concluded that the administration did not follow the appropriate procedures when it promulgated the new rules, and that federal law does not authorize the broad exemptions described by the Trump administration\u2019s rule.\nAs a general rule, proposed regulations must undergo a process known as \u201cnotice and comment,\u201d where the text of the proposed rule is released to the public so that anyone with an interest in that regulation may comment on it. The Trump administration bypassed notice and comment, although it did put the rule through this process retroactively after it was already in effect.\nAccording to the lower court, that\u2019s not allowed. Among other things, the administration claimed it could bypass notice and comment because of \u201cthe urgent need to alleviate harm to those with religious objections to the current regulations.\u201d But, according to Judge Patty Shwartz, who wrote the lower court opinion, that claim would allow too much.\n\u201cAll regulations are directed toward reducing harm in some manner,\u201d she explained in her opinion. So if harm reduction were sufficient reason to bypass ordinary procedures, those procedures would largely cease to exist.\nMore significantly, Shwartz wrote that no federal statute authorizes the Trump administration\u2019s rules. Though many federal laws permit agencies to issue binding regulations, agencies cannot act on their own \u2014 they can only regulate when Congress has given them the power to do so. \nJudge Shwartz\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that RFRA might let the administration exempt some religious objectors from some federal rules. But the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It\u2019s not the Moral Freedom Restoration Act. As Shwartz points out in a footnote, the Trump administration didn\u2019t even attempt to argue that \u201cRFRA authorizes or requires the Moral Exemption.\u201d\nSo what happens now?\nShould the Supreme Court ultimately agree with Shwartz that the administration needed to conduct notice and comment before this rule takes effect, that would temporarily strike down the rule. As a practical matter, however, the administration could eventually revive it by jumping through the appropriate procedural hoops.\nMeanwhile, it is probably inevitable that, one way or another, the Supreme Court will determine that religious objectors should enjoy broad exemptions from the requirement to provide birth control coverage. There were almost certainly four votes for this outcome when the Court heard Zubik, and Gorsuch, who occupies the seat that was vacant in 2016, is a staunch conservative in religion cases.\nBut the question of whether the administration can create a freestanding \u201cmoral\u201d exemption to a federal regulation is novel. And, as Shwartz notes, it\u2019s hard to find statutory support for such an exemption. It\u2019s possible this \u201cmoral\u201d exemption will be a bridge too far even for the current Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
