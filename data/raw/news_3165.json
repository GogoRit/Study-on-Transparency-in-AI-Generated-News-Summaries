And their Declaration changed the course of human history\u2026\u201dthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u2013That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2013That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.\u201d\nBut after we won our independence as nation, our Founders failed to ensure everyone was free. And nearly 90 years later, our fight for freedom continued on through the abolition movement, a bloody Civil War, and then decades of marching in streets to ensure full citizenship for Black Americans. This was our second fight for freedom.\nFriends, I believe it was no mistake as to why our founding fathers listed LIFE as the very first of those God-given rights in the Declaration of Independence\u2026for without life, none of our other rights matter. Abortion advocates want to claim that they are defending freedom of choice\u2014what we call violence, they call a \u201cwoman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d But\u00a0no one\u00a0has a right to choose death for another innocent human being. The Founders understood that freedom can only survive within the constraints of justice. If a king, slave holder, or even an abortion facility \u2026. can take away a person\u2019s life at will, then no one\u2019s rights are truly secure.\u00a0\n\nAnd when the protection of these rights become disordered, with one\u2019s pursuit of happiness or liberty preceding another\u2019s right to life \u2013 the result has always been the same devastation resulting in\u00a0subjugation to a foreign crown,\u00a0slavery\u00a0for those of a different skin color, and, since 1973,\u00a0death\u00a0for those whose existence is an inconvenience.\u00a0\nSo, today, on this the 49th anniversary of handing down of the\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0&\u00a0Doe v. Bolton\u00a0decisions, which together legalized abortion in all nine months of pregnancy,\u00a0I propose to you that it us, our generation\u2026each of us born after 1973 who all could have been aborted for the mere price of a playstation\u2026who have been called to launch what will be the third and final fight for freedom in our nation.\u00a0\nTo\u00a0end\u00a0the predatory lies and violence of the abortion industry.\u00a0\nTo\u00a0serve\u00a0every woman and family in crisis on our campus and in our community with hope, love, and tangible support.\nTo\u00a0protect\u00a0every baby and their very first freedom\u2026the right to be born, no matter their genetic code, race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or circumstance of conception.\nTo\u00a0ensure\u00a0Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton never see their 50th anniversary.\nTo\u00a0accomplish\u00a0our full mission of making abortion unthinkable and unavailable in our lifetime.\nTo\u00a0finally\u00a0make good\u00a0on our Founders\u2019 promise of a nation devoted to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d for every citizen, without exception. No matter their age, size, location, development, or circumstance.\nAnd as we anxiously, impatiently await the Supreme Court decision\u2019s in the\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0case this June, a decision that may very well throw\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0\u00a0on to the ash heap of history,\u00a0right where it belongs right alongside Dred Scott and Plessy,\u00a0and launch the next legal phase of the anti-abortion movement from Washington, D.C. to every state capitol\u2026.\nIt\u2019s time for us to work harder than we\u2019ve ever worked before.\nAt Students for Life, I proud to say that this Pro-Life Generation is a diverse army, that\u2019s more than 1300 campuses and more than 100,000 supporters strong. Every day,\u00a0you\u00a0have the most mind-changing conversations with those most-directly targeted by the abortion industry\u2019s create-a-customer business model. And every day, you ensure that no woman stands alone during her pregnancy or after the birth of her child.\nBut this morning, I\u2019m asking you to do more.\nTake out your phones right now and go to\u00a0StudentsforLIfe.org/Fight\u00a0to share the TV commercial Students for Life is running nationwide to recruit new members, both young and old, to our army.\n\nNext, be ready to call out the abortion lobby\u2019s post\u00a0Roe\u00a0plan which is a radical and dangerous expansion of Chemical Abortion Pills that are not only deadly for preborn children with heartbeats but their mothers. They even want them to come right to your campus health center. So, write this website down,\u00a0ThisisChemicalAbortion.com, for I need you to watch our brand-new social media docu-series on these threats and share the powerful and brutally honest testimonies of dozens of women harmed by these pills.\nAnd finally, before you leave this Summit, go to\u00a0PostRoeGeneration.org\u00a0to commit to your next steps after today. On this day, the49th anniversary of\u00a0Roe v. Wade,\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0pray you realize your future and take your place in this Final Fight for Freedom to become the first Post Roe Generation of Americans\u00a0by continuing your work on your campuses to change minds and unjust policies but also go out into your community, through Students for Life\u2019s\u00a0Campaign for Abortion Free Cities,\u00a0through our ground-breaking\u00a0Standing With You Initiative,\u00a0and or through our All Expense Paid for Activism Trips at\u00a0Students for Life Action, to get door by door, church by church, or computer to phone to show America, to show her the non-violent resources that exist to help her see abortion as we do\u2026unthinkable and help elect leaders who will stand with us to make it\u00a0\nOur fathers ended their Declaration, their call for revolution saying it was \u201cwith a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor\u201d.\u00a0\nMen and Women, Friends and Allies, our Founders\u2019 pledge is my pledge to you today\u2026my honor, my fortune, and my life \u2013 to ensure millions of lives may one day be free to live. The Fight Fight for Freedom is here. It\u2019s today. It\u2019s now.\u00a0\u00a0For there is no better cause in the world. And I\u2019m All in\u2026for Life.\n\n\n Post Views: 1,680\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
