Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Justice Department on Wednesday indicted 11 pro-life activists who investigators said blocked access to a Tennessee abortion clinic during a protest, saying they violated the FACE Act.    The activists, according to the indictment, organized an event blockading an abortion clinic near Nashville earlier this year. The DOJ alleges the group physically prevented both employees of the clinic and at least one would-be patient from entering the building in early March. The federal FACE Act prohibits demonstrators from blocking access to abortion clinics.The DOJ charged seven of the protesters with \"conspiracy against rights secured by the FACE Act,\" including Chester Gallagher, 73; Paul Vaughn, 55; Heather Idoni, 58; Calvin Zastrow, 57; Caroline Davis, 24; Coleman Boyd, 51; and Dennis Green, 56.  The indictment also charged four others with committing FACE Act violations: Eva Edl, 87; Eva Zastro, 24;\u00a0James Zastro, 25; and Paul Place, 24.

Those charged with FACE Act violations face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.  The DOJ alleges the protesters planned a \"blockade\" at the Carafem Health Center Clinic and \"blocked the clinic\u2019s entry doors and prevented a patient and an employee from entering.\"The DOJ also states that Boyd livestreamed the incident on social media and that footage showed members of the group \"attempting to engage a patient and her companion as Boyd told his livestream audience that the patient was a \u2018mom coming to kill her baby.\u2019\"  The charges come weeks after the FBI raided the home of a Catholic pro-life activist in Pennsylvania, alleging that he had assaulted a man outside an abortion clinic earlier this year.
