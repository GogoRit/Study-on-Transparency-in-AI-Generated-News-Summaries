She called the march \"a fight against good and evil.\u201dWhile there were many issues at stake\u00a0\u2014 from abortion rights to civil rights to global warming\u00a0\u2014 opposition to Trump was a unifying theme to many.\"One, we are in an election year,\" said Carmen Perez, an original co-chair of the Women's March.\u00a0\"Two, we are in potential war conversations, with the fact the U.S. has struck another country.\"On the Women Rising\u00a0Facebook page, D.C. organizers said this year's protest\u00a0arrived with \"renewed energy to take on Trumpism and a plan to build with a growing\u00a0community of activists.\"\u00a0They said the marchers \"will enter 2020 ready to finish what we started.\"In Sarasota, Florida, the sign Mimi Fiedler carried was blunt: \"Impeach Putin's Puppet.\" Her fellow marcher, Linda Postlewaite, had a similar message: \"Wake up R's. Trump is a crook.\"In Chicago, where organizers estimated a turnout at 10,000 people, marchers completed the planned route\u00a0from Grant Park to Federal Plaza,\u00a0then the more restless protesters continued through downtown and made their way to Trump Tower, where the march turned into a rally of a couple hundred people.Likewise in Washington, the march ended in front of the Trump International Hotel, steps away from Freedom Plaza. A small group of about 100 protesters, surrounded by a larger collective of marchers, performed \u201cA Rapist in Your Path,\u201d the thud of drums emphasizing their every move.Right when the march officially ended, the crowd mostly dispersed \u2014 but shouts continued, as protesters called for Trump to go to jail. Another key rallying cry: \u201cI believe we can win.\"Marches were held in a variety of cities, large and small. In Akron, Ohio, freezing rain and snow delayed the march, forcing many of the participants\u00a0indoors. In Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where about 500 people participated, many attended a Planned Parenthood workshop on protecting reproductive rights.\u00a0In Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, protesters sprinkled their signs with a bit of humor, one reading: \"It's so bad even introverts are here.\"In Austin, nearly 3,500 people rallied at the Texas State Capitol.\u00a0Qurrat Thakur, who brought along her daughter and niece, held a sign saying, \u201cRespect my Existence or Expect Resistance.\"Thakur said she attended the Austin event in hopes it would spark change so the girls by her side would not have to fight the same fight as the women who came before them.\u201cEveryone needs to be treated equally,\u201d Thakur said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to turn my daughter and niece into social justice warriors.\u201dWomen rising' but numbers are falling:2020 March tries to re-energize amid flagging enthusiasmIn New York City, activists battled the cold and snow as they marched along the edge of Central park and down Sixth Avenue.\u201cThis sense of community is life-changing,\u201d said marcher Belinda Jones of West Connecticut. \u201cThis is joyous.\u201dThe D.C. march focused on a smaller slate of issues, shifting away from its original 10-point program into three central themes:\u00a0reproductive rights, immigration and climate change. Similarly, Chicago's Women's March featured a \"gallery of issues,\" highlighting\u00a0voting, the census, climate justice, gun violence prevention and women's health.\"It's just trying to create a very festive atmosphere, but one that encourages our marchers to educate themselves on the issues and activate around them,\" said Chicago march organizer Harlene Ellin.\u00a0\"We want people not just to march, but to go out and do something.\"To many women, the theme of the day was about persistence.\u00a0In Sarasota, Susie Sherwood fought the wind coming off the Gulf Coast as she held a sign reading, \"Let's leave this world a better place for children.\"\u00a0\"We've been doing this since 2016,\" she said, \"and are not giving up.\"In Washington, humanitarian and activist Andrea Waters King told the crowd that it was not good enough to remember the gains of the past, like the women's right to vote.\u201cWe must see this march as a time of rededication and renewal ... this can be the decade that ushers in new freedom.\u201dMartin Luther King Jr.'s son still works to achieve the dream:\u00a0'The work is nowhere near complete'In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted that many women have been elected to office \"up and down the country,\" but she quickly added: \"We're not resting.\"She also urged marchers not to let their passions about individual issues divide them: \"It\u00a0is crucial that we stay united.\"Contributing: Heather Osbourne of the Austin American-Statesman in Austin, Texas; Anna Bryson of the Herald-Tribune in Sarasota, Florida; Rebecca King of\u00a0 northjersey.com in New York City; Scott Broden of the Daily News Journal in Murfreesboro,\u00a0Tennessee; and Jorge Ortiz, USA TODAY.USA TODAY's Doug Stanglin reported from McLean, Virginia; Joshua Bote from Washington, D.C.; and Grace Hauck in Chicago.\u00a0Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
