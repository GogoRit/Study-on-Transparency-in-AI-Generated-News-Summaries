When Cosmopolitan pressed her on the fact that her parental leave plan, which offered nothing to fathers or mothers who didn\u2019t physically give birth, stood to further entrench women\u2019s disproportionate share of parenting responsibilities, she lost her usual composure and snapped at the journalist interviewing her. Former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, tried to bribe the organization into halting its abortion care, by promising to secure more funding for it if it eliminated abortion services\u2014a deal that would have been a major victory for Donald Trump, whom anti-abortion groups have called the \u201cmost pro-life president ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest newsletter\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\n\n        Thanks for signing up!

Ivanka has consistently sought to portray herself as a moderating force in her dad\u2019s administration, a poised and culture war\u2013averse influence to balance out the far-right ideologues on staff. She once told the New York Times that she wanted to sand down the edges of her father\u2019s worst policies, especially those on climate policy and immigration. And she never talked about abortion. She seemed to want her presence to soothe voters\u2014particularly women who were a bit turned off by Donald Trump\u2019s demeanor and extremism but were looking for reasons to feel OK about supporting him anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of the Trump administration, it has become ever clearer that Ivanka\u2019s supposed influence isn\u2019t worth a dime. If Ivanka Trump has had any success in her alleged mission to make her dad\u2019s presidency less catastrophic, it\u2019s entirely invisible. If kidnapping migrant children from their parents with no plan to reunite them was the Ivanka-moderated policy, what was the original? Ivanka claimed to be an LGBTQ ally, but never uttered a peep when her father barred transgender Americans from serving in the military. Donald Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, opened up protected lands to fossil fuel pillagers, and is reversing almost 100 environmental regulations. From where did Ivanka pull him back? This administration\u2019s total lack of federal response to the COVID-19 crisis has forced hundreds of thousands of women, many of them mothers, out of the workforce.

So, like the rest of the Trump campaign, Ivanka is pivoting to riling up the base rather than attempting to win over those in the middle. Aware that women have fled from his side with haste, the president is making his rallies more sexist than ever in an attempt to energize his sexist supporters. Likewise, Ivanka is adjusting her image to better align with Trump fans who support him unconditionally. They\u2019re the only people left to please: Donald Trump has already revealed himself to be the cruel, wannabe-authoritarian president he promised he\u2019d be. Four years in, there are no Americans whose concerns about a Donald Trump presidency could be assuaged by a seemingly intelligent daughter-adviser with a women\u2019s empowerment shtick. She seems to have realized that she might as well give up that act and try out a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              2020 Campaign\n            \n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Donald Trump\n            \n\n\n              Ivanka Trump\n            \n\n\n              Media\n            \n\n\n              Women\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
