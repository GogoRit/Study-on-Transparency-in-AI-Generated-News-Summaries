Wade, which had ensured a federal right to an abortion. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\nHow we did this\nPew Research Center conducted this study to better understand Americans\u2019 attitudes about abortion and their reaction to the June 24, 2022, U.S. Supreme Court decision overruling Roe v. Wade. For this analysis, we surveyed 6,174 U.S. adults between June 27 and July 4, 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for the report and its methodology.\n\nA majority of Americans disapprove of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling overturning the Roe v. Wade decision, which had guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. Public support for legal abortion remains largely unchanged since before the decision, with 62% saying it should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nNearly six-in-ten adults (57%) disapprove of the court\u2019s sweeping decision, including 43% who strongly disapprove. About four-in-ten (41%) approve of the court\u2019s decision (25% strongly approve).\nPartisan differences on the legality of abortion have widened in recent years, and Republicans and Democrats are sharply divided in their initial views of the court\u2019s decision.\nAbout eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (82%) disapprove of the court\u2019s decision, including nearly two-thirds (66%) who strongly disapprove. Most Republicans and Republican leaners (70%) approve of the court\u2019s ruling; 48% strongly approve.\nThe new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted among 6,174 Americans between June 27 and July 4 on the nationally representative American Trends Panel, finds that most women (62%) disapprove of the decision to end the federal right to an abortion. More than twice as many women strongly disapprove of the court\u2019s decision (47%) as strongly approve (21%). Opinion among men is more closely divided: 52% disapprove (37% strongly), while 47% approve (28% strongly).\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe gives the states the authority to set their own abortion policies. These laws vary widely, and in several cases, state laws that prohibit or place tight restrictions on access to abortion are currently facing legal challenges.\nThe survey finds that adults living in the 17 states where abortion is newly largely prohibited (or where prohibitions are set to take effect soon) are divided in opinions about the court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe: 46% approve of the court\u2019s decision, while slightly more (52%) disapprove. (Information on state laws on abortion following the Supreme Court decision overruling Roe v. Wade is based on tracking data compiled by The New York Times. Data for each state is current as of July 5, 2022; see appendix for the complete categorization of states.)\nOpinion also is divided among adults in the four states that have new gestational restrictions on abortion in effect (or set to soon take effect) but have not prohibited it outright: 52% in these states disapprove of the court\u2019s decision, while 47% approve. The balance of opinion is similar in the nine states where the status of the state\u2019s abortion laws are uncertain (in which further action may be taken in the near term by state governors, legislatures or public referendum).\n\nIn the 20 states (plus the District of Columbia) where abortions are legal through at least 24 weeks of pregnancy, 65% disapprove of the court\u2019s decision, including half who strongly disapprove. About a third of adults in these states approve of the court\u2019s decision (34%), with just 19% strongly approving.\nThe survey finds that a majority of adults nationally (62%) say abortion should be legal in all (29%) or most cases (33%); 36% say it should be illegal in all (8%) or most cases (28%). These views are little changed since March.\n\nThe partisan divide in abortion opinions remains wide. In the new survey, 84% of Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 38% of Republicans.\nWhile the share of Democrats who favor legal abortion in either all or most cases has changed only modestly since March (from 80%), there has been a 7 percentage point increase in the share of Democrats saying abortion should be legal in all cases, from 38% to 45%; currently, a larger share of Democrats say it should be legal in all cases than say it should be legal in most cases (45% vs. 38%).\nThere has been virtually no change in Republicans\u2019 views since earlier this year; a 60% majority say abortion should be illegal in most (48%) or all cases (13%).\nMajorities in many demographic groups disapprove of decision to overturn Roe v. Wade; clear majority of White evangelicals approve\n\nAmericans\u2019 opinions about the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2013 which ended the long-standing federal guarantee to abortion \u2013 differ widely by race and ethnicity, age, education, and religion.\nMajorities of Asian American, Black, Hispanic and White adults disapprove of the decision, but opposition is most pronounced among Asian (72% disapprove) and Black adults (67%). Smaller shares of White (55%) and Hispanic adults (56%) disapprove.\nThe youngest adults are more likely than older people to disapprove of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on abortion. About two-thirds of adults under the age of 30 (69%) say they disapprove of the decision \u2013 including 55% who strongly disapprove. While 60% of those ages 30 to 49 also disapprove, those 50 and older are divided (51% disapprove, 48% approve).\nTwo-thirds of adults with a postgraduate degree say they disapprove of the Court\u2019s decision, with a majority (55%) saying they strongly disapprove. Nearly six-in-ten adults with a college degree or some college experience (60% each) say they disapprove of the decision. Among those with a high school degree or less, views are nearly evenly divided: 48% approve and 50% disapprove.\nAmong religious groups, 71% of White Evangelical Protestants approve of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on abortion, including a 54% majority who strongly approve. Just 27% say they disapprove.\nBy contrast, White Protestants who are not evangelical are more divided in their views. About half (47%) say they approve of this decision, including 28% who strongly approve. A similar share (52%) say they disapprove, including four-in-ten who strongly disapprove. Catholics are similarly divided: 48% approve of the decision and 51% disapprove.\nAbout two-thirds of Black Protestants (68%) disapprove of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, including roughly half (48%) who strongly disapprove. About three-in-ten (29%) say they approve of the decision.\n\nSimilarly, a large majority of religiously unaffiliated adults (77%) disapprove of the court\u2019s decision, with 63% saying they strongly disapprove. About two-in-ten (22%) approve.\nAdults who are not married or living with a partner are 11 percentage points more likely to say they disapprove of the decision than those who are married or living with a partner (64% vs. 53%, respectively).\nWhile women (62%) are more likely than men (52%) to disapprove of the Supreme Court decision on abortion, the gender gap varies by race and ethnicity. Among White adults, a 62% majority of women disapprove of the court\u2019s decision, compared with 47% of White men. By contrast, comparable shares of Black men (66%) and women (69%) and Hispanic men (59%) and women (54%) disapprove.\n\nWhile Republicans and Republican-leaning independents approve of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, there is variation in the extent to which subgroups of Republicans \u2013 particularly by gender and age \u2013 approve of the decision.\nAmong Republican women, 63% approve of the decision, while 36% disapprove. By comparison, 76% of GOP men approve and 23% disapprove. Roughly eight-in-ten Democratic and Democratic-leaning men (83%) and women (81%) disapprove of the decision.\nA slim majority (56%) of Republicans under the age of 30 approve of the court\u2019s decision, while 43% say they disapprove. Older Republicans are more likely to approve of the decision. Among those ages 30 to 49, 64% approve, while 35% disapprove. And nearly eight-in-ten Republicans 50 and older (78%) approve of the decision, while just 22% disapprove. Sizable majorities of Democrats across all age groups \u2013 80% or more \u2013 disapprove of the decision.\nHowever, while large majorities of White, Black and Hispanic Democrats disapprove of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on abortion, opposition is higher among White Democrats (89% disapprove) than among Black (74%) or Hispanic Democrats (69%).\nAmericans\u2019 views of abortion\n\nThe wide differences in support for legal abortion across race and ethnicity, educational attainment and religious groups are little changed since earlier this year.\nAbout six-in-ten Americans (62%) say abortion should be legal in all (29%) or most (33%) cases. Around a third of the public (36%) says abortion should be illegal in all (8%) or most (28%) cases.\nTwo-thirds of women (66%) say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, compared with a narrower majority (57%) of men.\nAbout seven-in-ten Black (71%) and Asian (78%) adults say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Smaller majorities among White (60%) and Hispanic (61%) adults also say this.\nYounger adults are more supportive of legal abortion than older adults. Seven-in-ten adults ages 18 to 29 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases (including 41% who say it should be legal in all cases), as do 64% of those 30 to 49. Among those 50 and older, 57% say abortion should be legal in at least most cases.\nAmericans with postgraduate degrees are particularly likely to say abortion should be legal in at least most cases; 72% say this, as do 65% of those with college degrees and an identical share (65%) of those with some college experience but no degree. Adults with a high school degree or less education (55%) are the least likely to say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nThere are wide gaps across religious groups in views of abortion. An overwhelming share of religiously unaffiliated adults (83%) support abortion being legal in all or most cases, as do six-in-ten Catholics. Overall, Protestants are divided in their views (48% legal in all or most cases, 50% illegal in all or most cases): About three-quarters of White evangelicals say abortion should be illegal in all (20%) or most cases (53%), while majorities of Black Protestants (71%) and White non-evangelical Protestants (61%) take the position that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nAmericans who are married or living with a partner are somewhat less supportive of legal access to abortion (59%) than those who are not married or living with a partner (67%). There is a similar gap between parents and people who do not have any children (67% of non-parents say abortion should be legal in all or most cases vs. 59% of parents).\n\nAbout three-quarters of conservative Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (73%) say abortion should be illegal in all (16%) or most (56%) cases. By contrast, a majority of moderate and liberal Republicans (60%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\nAbout three-quarters (77%) of conservative and moderate Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, as do roughly nine-in-ten liberal Democrats (92%). However, liberal Democrats (59%) are much more likely than conservative and moderate Democrats (34%) to say abortion should be legal in all cases.\nCorrection (July 11, 2022): The following sentence was updated to reflect the correct difference in shares between adults who are not married or living with a partner and adults who are married or living with a partner who say they disapprove of the court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade: \u201cAdults who are not married or living with a partner are 11 percentage points more likely to say they disapprove of the decision than those who are married or living with a partner (64% vs. 53%, respectively).\u201d\nThe change did not affect the report\u2019s substantive findings.\n\n\n\n\nNext: Acknowledgments \n\n\u2190 Prev Page\n\n\n\nYou are reading page1Page2Page3Page4 \n\n\nNext Page \u2192\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSign up for our Politics newsletterSent weekly on Wednesday\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Materials\n  Topline Questionnaire  Complete Report PDF\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMajority of Public Disapproves of Supreme Court\u2019s Decision To Overturn Roe v.
