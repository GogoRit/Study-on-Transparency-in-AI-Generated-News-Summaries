There would be exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother.\nCurrent Nebraska law bans abortion after 20 weeks.\nDozens of people are expected to testify at the public hearing on LB 626 on Wednesday afternoon.\nWhile opponents such as Waller contend the bill is government intrusion on personal health care decisions and could force women to take extreme and dangerous means to end an unwanted pregnancy, abortion opponents maintain that life begins at conception and should be protected.\nSandy Danek of Nebraska Right to Life said she became an activist after she had a stillborn child. She is now a facilitator for a Catholic Church hospice program called \u201cHealing Heart,\u201d which provides support and counseling for couples facing a stillbirth.\nHospice care is an alternative\nThe program gives couples more time to grieve, Danek said, and a chance to hold their child before it dies.\n\u201cWith hospice care, it gives them the support they need to allow their baby to come to natural death,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nBut during a virtual press conference Tuesday sponsored by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, Waller and three other women related their personal experience with barriers to an abortion.\nOne, Kacie Ware of Omaha, said she was abused and raped by a much older man and became pregnant during high school.\nShe said she believes that the heartbeat bill would have prevented her from getting an abortion because she had to go through the time-consuming \u201cjudicial bypass\u201d procedure required of a minor to get an abortion without parental permission.\nBan would \u2018end safe abortions\u2019\n\u201cI would have done anything to end the pregnancy,\u201d said Ware, now the mother of two. \u201cAbortion bans are only going to end safe abortions.\u201d\nWaller said she was excited to learn that she was pregnant with her second child, but genetic tests indicated that her baby had Downs syndrome and that her brain wasn\u2019t developing correctly and had a heart condition.\nDoctors told her the baby had only a 10% of survival, and even if she survived, she would only live a few months and would have to be hooked to a ventilator.\nWaller said she and her husband made the \u201cdifficult\u201d choice of abortion, which was performed two years ago. She said that since genetic testing is allowed only after 10 weeks, the heartbeat bill would have forced her to \u201cwait for my child to die on her own.\u201d\nHospice care\nDanek, of Nebraska Right to Life, said she often hears from couples who want to bring their child to term, even when they know they might not be viable.\n  Opponents of abortion rights filled the streets of Lincoln near the State Capitol on Saturday for the annual \u201cWalk of Life\u201d demonstration.
