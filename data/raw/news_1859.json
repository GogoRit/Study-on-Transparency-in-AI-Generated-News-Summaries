Richardson Preyer Federal Courthouse in Greensboro (Photo: Lynn Bonner) \n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\u00a0 District Court Judge Catherine Eagles was clear Wednesday that she would not put a freeze on the state\u2019s recently enacted 12-week abortion ban, meaning that most of the restrictions will take effect July 1.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic and a Duke University OB/GYN sued to stop the law from taking effect, at least temporarily. Brigitte Amiri, the ACLU lawyer representing Duke OB/GYN Beverly Gray, asked Eagles Wednesday to put a hold on the entire law. Eagles said she wouldn\u2019t, calling the request \u201coverbroad relief.\u201d\nWhat Eagles will do with some of the abortion providers\u2019 specific complaints are a different matter. They\u2019re tied up not only by lawyers\u2019 differing views of what the law says, but also with the timing of changes the legislature made in response to the lawsuit. It\u2019s possible Gov. Roy Cooper will veto the bill containing the corrections, so the abortion law\u2019s mistakes would be in force for a while. Or, Cooper could sign the clean-up bill before Saturday, meaning that a federal court order putting some of the law\u2019s changes on hold wouldn\u2019t be needed.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I do agree, a narrow injunction is appropriate,\u201d Eagles said. \u201cProbably, I do have to do something if the Governor doesn\u2019t act. How that should be worded, I don\u2019t exactly know.\u201d\nEagles said she would have a decision by Friday. Most of the law takes effect Saturday. It bans most abortions after 12 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest, \u201clife-limiting fetal anomalies\u201d and emergencies.\u00a0\nThe legislature this week passed a bill clearing up in the law. For example, a change made it clear that medication abortions will be allowed through 12 weeks. The clean-up bill received final legislative votes on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe House sent that to Gov. Roy Cooper, but as of Wednesday afternoon, he had not signed it. If he decides to veto it, there may be two weeks or more during which some of the problematic provisions would be in effect.\u00a0\nThe legislature would likely override a veto, said Ellis Boyle, the attorney representing Republican legislative leaders. Cooper has until July 7 to sign the bill or veto it, Boyle said. He could also announce it will become law without his signature. If Cooper decides to veto the bill, the veto would take two to four weeks to override, Boyle said. He was accounting for legislators\u2019 July vacations. (Some recent veto overrides have been accomplished in a much shorter time frame.)\nA lag would mean that provisions abortion providers said were vague or contradictory, and that the legislature meant to change, would be in force for weeks.\u00a0\nOpposing lawyers did not agree that some of the legislature\u2019s changes went far enough.\nThe legislature changed the law this week, with Republicans explaining that they intended to say it is okay to give someone advice on how to get a legal out-of-state abortion after 12 weeks\u2019 gestation.\n\u201cNorth Carolina can\u2019t stop someone from driving a person to another state after 12 weeks,\u201d Boyle said.\nLawyers for abortion providers say the law still has problems.\u00a0\nOn Monday, the Senate rejected a proposed change to the clean-up bill that Democrats offered that would make it clear that people can help women seeking out-of-state abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are in a different world where there is heightened concern about the use of statutes to go after abortion providers,\u201d Amiri said.\u00a0\nBoyle and the abortion providers\u2019 lawyers hold different positions on a section of the law requiring a provider prescribing abortion pills to document that the pregnancy is in the uterus using an ultrasound.\u00a0\nBoyle said the requirements were to ensure that someone with an ectopic pregnancy \u2014 where a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus \u2014 isn\u2019t given abortion pills. They shouldn\u2019t be used with ectopic pregnancies, according to the FDA.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to give abortion pills when there is an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nPeter Im, the Planned Parenthood of America lawyer, said some people seeking abortion pills don\u2019t have gestational sacs visible in ultrasounds. They may have miscarriages after positive pregnancy test results, or may be seeking pills so early in pregnancy that gestational sacs aren\u2019t visible, he said.\nThe law \u201cprohibits providing medication abortion for pregnancy of unknown location,\u201d Im said. \u201cMedication abortion can safely be provided for pregnancy of unknown location.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXFederal judge won\u2019t stop NC\u2019s 12-week abortion ban from starting July 1\nby Lynn Bonner, NC Newsline June 28, 2023\nFederal judge won\u2019t stop NC\u2019s 12-week abortion ban from starting July 1\nby Lynn Bonner, NC Newsline June 28, 2023\n U.S.\u00a0 District Court Judge Catherine Eagles was clear Wednesday that she would not put a freeze on the state\u2019s recently enacted 12-week abortion ban, meaning that most of the restrictions will take effect July 1.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic and a Duke University OB/GYN sued to stop the law from taking effect, at least temporarily.
