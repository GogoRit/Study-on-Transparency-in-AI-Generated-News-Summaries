Wade, the landmark national protection for abortion access, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray convened a Senate briefing on the state of abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health obliterated Roe, gutting abortion access in abortion-hostile states and placing a growing burden of care on states like Washington.\nContinue reading Ahead of Roe Anniversary, Sen.

Jackson Women\u2019s Health last year, I heard panicky speculation about what would come next: criminalizing people for their pregnancy outcomes. I have bad news, I thought grimly. That was already happening. It\u2019s not going to be new. It\u2019s going to be worse.\nContinue reading Emerging Data Shows Pregnant People Face a Greater Risk of Prosecution Without Roe \u2014 And Not Just For Abortion \u2192 \nAbortionDobbs v.

Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, speculation swirled as to how the decision would impact abortion access. But it was difficult to capture meaningful data in the immediate aftermath: Abortion rates shift seasonally, and they were already on the rise in states like Washington in the years before Dobbs, largely because of restrictive abortion laws that have propagated throughout conservative-controlled state legislatures since Roe v. Wade was first decided.\nNow, emerging data on the fallout from Dobbs is getting clearer: What was already a national crisis in maternal health among Americans has been catalyzed by the loss of Roe, according to physicians responsible for providing pregnancy care across the country, both in states with abortion bans and broader access to care. From March 17 to May 18, health policy organization KFF surveyed 569 obstetrician-gynecologists about their experiences after Dobbs and released the results of its national survey on June 21. Here are the major takeaways from the report \u2014 and what they could mean for the Pacific Northwest.\nContinue reading OB-GYNs Say Dobbs Has Harmed Their Capacity to Provide Care and Deepened Health Disparities \u2192 \nAbortionAbortion AccessDobbs v.

Wade was overturned, representatives from service providers and community organizations \u2014 everyone from the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project to the Girl Scouts \u2014 stood behind tables lining a path at Tacoma\u2019s Wright Park, steps from an array of picnic-table birthday parties, a congested playground and adjacent splash pad, and a botanical conservatory and foliage drawing yellow butterflies. Anyone who happened to stroll along could stop by to sign up for cash or food assistance, learn about accessing medical care through Medicaid, or just grab a lollipop. You wouldn\u2019t know by the look of it that the event, the Grit City Community Resource Fair, was crafted as a response to crisis pregnancy centers, right-wing-operated groups that offer nominal resources, like free pregnancy testing, as part of a coordinated agenda to dissuade people from having abortions.\nContinue reading OPINION | South Sound Reproductive Health Activists Debunk False Promises of Crisis Pregnancy Centers \u2192 \nCrisis Pregnancy CentersDobbs v.

Now We Know How Important That Is\n\nJune 9, 2023 Editor \n\n\nby Megan Burbank\n\nEven before the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision leaked a year ago, Washington State lawmakers established new and strengthened protections for abortion access, shielding providers and patients from prosecution and protecting private health information not covered under HIPAA. Though the impact of Dobbs will likely not be fully understood for years or even decades, recent developments nationwide show how critical Washington\u2019s protective policies are.\nContinue reading OPINION | In Recent Years, Washington Expanded Abortion Access.

Wade\n\nJuly 1, 2022 Editor \n\n\nby Ronnie Estoque\n\nOn June 24, protestors filled the streets of Downtown Seattle in response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had protected abortions at the federal level. Prior to marching, protestors gathered outside of the Federal Building for a rally that was organized by the Puget Sound Mobilization for Reproductive Justice (PSMRJ) \u2014 a growing coalition of groups and individuals initiated by Radical Women nationally to step up the defense of abortion rights. The event was also coordinated alongside other protests occurring in other cities across the U.S.\u00a0\nContinue reading Seattle Protests the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision to Overturn Roe v.

Jay Inslee\u2019s signoff, birth doulas in Washington State have established their work as a profession based on voluntary competency-based state certification, paving the way for reimbursement under Medicaid. ESHB 1881 passed both chambers in Olympia earlier this month, where it drew broad support, passing with a wide margin of 85\u20138, backing from both parties in the House, and unanimous support in the Senate, according to a media release from Surge Reproductive Justice, an organization backing the legislation. It was among a docket of bills Inslee signed into law on Wednesday, March 30, in a ceremony at the State Capitol streamed live on TVW. \nContinue reading Washington Birth Doulas Advocated for a Pathway to Certification \u2014 and Won \u2192 \nDoulas for All CoalitionESHB 1881FeaturedFeaturesGovernor Jay InsleeJasmyne BryantMedicaidMegan BurbankReproductive HealthReproductive Health CareReproductive Justice\n\n\n \n\n\nVoices\n\nMy Solidarity Vigil for the Immigrant Women Sterilized in Georgia\n\nOctober 9, 2020 Editor \n\n\nby Heather Rosewarne\n\nWhen I heard the news on September 21 that immigrant women at Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia had their reproductive organs removed without consent, I was horrified then angry. I had spent the previous day in a conference about systemic racism in healthcare with a specific focus on violence against enslaved women in U.S. history. Currently, immigrants in detention are particularly vulnerable to abuse and neglect, but the reports of the reproductive violence in Georgia are particularly chilling.\u00a0\u00a0\nI have lived and worked on the Texas-Mexico border in shelters with immigrant and refugee families. There I heard first-hand stories about people\u2019s migration journeys such as leaving home because there was no work to support their families or because of gang violence in which their lives are threatened. People leave when situations are dire, traveling by foot, on buses or trains, with the hope of better opportunities elsewhere. In general, people flee their countries of origin because of extreme political and social instability, where many endure violence and persecution. Many migrants experience sexual violence along the journey and then suffer abuses while held prisoner in U.S. immigration facilities. Most of these people will be deported without fair legal access.\u00a0\nOver the last 15 years as a labor and delivery nurse in Seattle, I have cared for people giving birth as well as during emergencies and tragedies. Fundamental healthcare rights include making sure people understand what\u2019s happening during their care, holding space for questions, using medical interpreters, getting consent, and giving access to pain medicine when needed. The fact that none of these basic healthcare rights were given to incarcerated people is heartbreaking. When people are given a consent to sign in medical jargon in a language they don\u2019t understand or are coerced to make a decision by a medical authority, that is not proper informed consent.\nContinue reading My Solidarity Vigil for the Immigrant Women Sterilized in Georgia \u2192 \nFeaturedHysterectomyImmigrant DetentionImmigrant RightsInvoluntary SterilizationIrwin County Detention CenterMedical MalpracticeProject SouthReproductive JusticeReproductive ViolenceResolution 1153\n\n\n\nAmplifying the Authentic Narratives of South Seattle\n\nAbout\n\nOur Team\nOur Board\nOur Content Contributors\nOur Partners\n\n\nStandards & Ethics\n\nConflict of Interest & Outside Employment Policy\nEditorial Independence Policy\nFunding & Financial Transparency\n\n\nWork With Us\nSupport\nContact\n \n\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) organization, the South Seattle Emerald cannot endorse candidates or political campaigns.\nFollow Us\n\n\nTwitter   \n\n\nFacebook   \n\n\nInstagram   \n\n\nNEVER MISS A GREAT STORY WITH OUR WEEKLY NEWSLETTERStories that matter, delivered daily\n\n\nBe the first to get new stories sent straight into your inbox.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address:\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFollow\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab Our Latest Literary South End Mixtape:South Seattle is Reading:\n\nFind All the Flowering Cherry Trees in Seattle With This Updated Interactive Map\n\n\nDOOM LOOP: Reboot\n\n\nNEWS GLEAMS | KC Sheriff Refuses to Enforce Burien Homelessness Law; Potential TikTok Ban Moves to the Senate\n\n\nBeacon Hill Produce Stand MacPherson\u2019s Reopens\n\n\nOPINION | Under Sara Nelson, More Money for Cops, Less for Communities\n\n\nMy TweetsLIKE us on Facebook: \n\nLIKE us on Facebook:\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
