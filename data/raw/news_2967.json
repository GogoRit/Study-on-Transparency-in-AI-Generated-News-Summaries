Wulfsohn  Fox News  \n      Published\n       August 27, 2022 12:41am EDT  Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email  close      Video This was a lie and I have never been for abortion: Elaine Riddick The Rebecca Project for Justice\u2019s Elaine Riddick discusses how The Washington Post exploited the pro-lifer\u2019s painful past to advance its abortion agenda on \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight.\u2019 \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher rejected the notion that someone who opposes abortions means they \"hate women.\"    During Friday night's panel discussion, Maher boasted how the abortion debate that's been revived following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has helped motivate Democrats ahead of the midterms, which had previously forecasted a red wave for a big Republican takeover of Congress.\u00a0\"The Supreme Court did you, politically, a big favor,\" Maher told Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. \"Because for a while, people were, 'I don't know, this really gonna get people out to the polls?' We have enough evidence now with these special elections and the polling, we see. And you know, who really is up in arms about this that we didn't think was going to be? Dads.\"  BILL MAHER RAILS AGAINST \u2018CONSPIRACY\u2019 BY MEDIA, BIG TECH, TO SUPPRESS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY IN 2020  \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher went to bat for pro-lifers who are often attacked by Democrats as being anti-women. (HBO)  Klobuchar responded by saying she sees it as \"the women of America and the men who stand with them don't believe that politicians should be telling them what to do with their bodies.\"  She then referred to her last appearance on \"Real Time\" last year, telling Maher he \"didn't agree\" with her on abortion, which prompted the host to push back.\"I'm certainly pro-choice\u2026 What I'm saying is you shouldn't say to the other side, 'You people hate women.\u2019 They don't hate women. They just think it's murder,\" Maher said. \"And if you think it's murder, then you can't go, \u2018Well except for people with a vagina. They can commit murder.\u2019 I don't think it's murder, but they legitimately do. And it insults them.\"  BILL MAHER SAYS DEMS COULD \u2018LOSE\u2019 ABORTION ISSUE BY USING WOKE TERMS LIKE \u2018BIRTHING PEOPLE\u2019 INSTEAD OF WOMEN\"There are pro-life people that have the view- that's fine. They just don't think that they should put their views on someone else,\" Klobuchar told Maher.\u00a0  \"But you wouldn't say that about a murderer. And that's what their point is,\" Maher exclaimed. \"But it's not because they hate women.\"  Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., speaks before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2020, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, Pool) (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)    Director and liberal activist Rob Reiner chimed in, claiming pro-lifers are pushing a \"Christian nationalist agenda.\"\"Not everyone who is pro-life is a Christian nationalist,\" Maher said.BILL MAHER ADMITS FBI RAID IS \u2018SAVING TRUMP POLITICALLY\u2019 JUST AS HIS FORTUNE WAS \u2018FINALLY FALLING\u2019    \"No, no, no, no, I'm not saying that,\" Reiner responded. \"I'm not saying everybody who's pro-life. I'm saying the people who think it's murder and there should be no exceptions for that. That's a very small group of people. That's not the vast majority of people in this country.\"\"No, it's not. But it's a sizable minority,\" Maher replied.\u00a0  \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher. (HBO) (HBO)In June, Maher suggested the abortion issue could actually hurt Democrats, particularly if they kept pushing their \"woke\" idealogy.\u00a0  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    \"For decades, liberals have said, 'If only men could get pregnant, this wouldn't even be an issue' and 'abortion rights are women's rights.' Well, that's wrong now,\" Maher said during a monologue. \"When the wokey end of the progressive spectrum talks about abortion now, they shy away from that word 'women' and preferred terms like \u2018birthing people\u2019 or \u2018people who menstruate\u2019 because somewhere there's a trans man was pregnant and I say good for him- and I'll be looking for his story somewhere in a future issue of 'Ripley's Believe It or Not.'\"\"Oh, Democrats, let's take the first f---ing word a human animal understands: mama- and replace it with something best understood by four Trotskyites at Berkeley,\" Maher told his audience.\u00a0  Joseph A.
