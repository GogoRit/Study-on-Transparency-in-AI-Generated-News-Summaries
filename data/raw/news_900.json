Lauren Book and then passed the bill on a party lines vote.\u201cWe have to give these survivors a little grace,\u201d Book said before her amendment failed. \u201cIf a girl or a woman does not want to carry a pregnancy to term because she did not consent to being raped, none of the members of this committee should be able to deny her a safe a legal abortion because she needed more time.\u201dSen. Kelli Stargel, a Republican who sponsored the bill, noted that her proposal was not an all-out ban on abortion and said allowing such exemptions would give criminals more room to hide sexual crimes.\u201cI think this amendment does nothing to solve the problems that we all agree are awful \u2014 rape, human trafficking, incest \u2014 and I will partner with you to fight these crimes and I will partner with you to take the people who are doing that to these children to the furthest extent of the law,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think allowing those individuals to continue to hide their crimes by forcing the abortions or allowing those abortions are going to solve that problem.\u201d\n\n\nCopyright 2022 Scripps Media, Inc.
