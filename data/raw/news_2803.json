Here\u2019s my response.Jeannie GaffiganOctober 01, 2020Election yard signs are seen outside of an early voting site in Fairfax, Va., Sept. 18, 2020. (CNS photo/Al Drago, Reuters)Editor\u2019s note: This essay is part of a series of articles on the presidential election. For more, including alternative views on the candidates, visit\u00a0americamagazine.org/election2020.On the closing night of the Republican National Convention, my husband, the comedian Jim Gaffigan, shocked Twitter with a highly uncharacteristic, profanity-laden\u00a0rant against President Trump.His online outburst shocked me as much as it did so many others. Of course I knew how he felt about the president\u2014in private. But in Jim\u2019s public persona as an entertainer, he has mostly steered clear of politics and focused on other divisive issues like mayonnaise, napping and horses. His 20-year career of clean and apolitical comedy unraveled with one tweet. When I saw the tweet, I was so confused and embarrassed that I didn\u2019t even realize who or what he was reacting to.[Podcast: Jeannie Gaffigan was told \u2018Real Catholics vote for Trump.\u2019 Here\u2019s how she responded.]The next day when I opened\u00a0my Twitter feed, it had suddenly become the battlefield of a modern-day culture war, complete with compliments, fiery insults, plenty of bots and\u2014my personal favorite\u2014speculation that I was the lefty Jezebel behind my husband\u2019s anti-Trump tirade. My critics seemed to conclude: If you don\u2019t support Mr. Trump, you,\u00a0Jeannie Gaffigan, mother of five, are a pro-abortion, \u201cfake Catholic.\u201dIronically, what set off Jim\u2019s \u201cIrish temper,\u201d as my mother calls it, was that speakers at the R.N.C. repeatedly called Joe Biden\u2019s faith into question and accused him of being something that sounded very much like a \u201cfake Catholic.\u201d And now the finger-pointing is directed at the Gaffigans.My critics seemed to conclude: If you don\u2019t support Mr. Trump, you, Jeannie Gaffigan, mother of five, are a pro-abortion, \u201cfake Catholic.\u201dHere is my confession: I am a real Catholic, and I am not going to vote for Donald J. Trump.I was not even watching the convention when Jim went on his Twitter tirade. Like many mothers of big families, the pandemic quarantine has not allotted me much time to kick my feet up and watch TV. By day, I run from room to room, vacuuming endless snack crumbs and unsuccessfully trying to connect multiple children to Zoom classes while losing track of my full cup of coffee I had made hours earlier. By night, I am begging my kids not to brush their teeth with ice cream, while sorting through mountains of laundry, perplexed at how so many matching socks are missing when no one has left the house in six months. I had no desire to watch the convention. Political news coverage these days makes it seem like there are two completely separate Americas, and neither one seems real. TV news just riles me up, and I have plenty of other sources of rile.But at this point I was in deep. We all know the primary purpose of Twitter is to feed one\u2019s ego, so now defend my Catholicism I must.Here is my confession: I am a real Catholic, and I am not going to vote for Donald J. Trump.My faith, family and Catholic education have given me the belief in the innate dignity and worth of every single human being. Human life is sacred, and all humans have equal value. Of course, this means it is wrong to intentionally take a human life under any circumstances, but it is also wrong to disregard human life through racism, unjust social and economic structures, providing inadequate access to health care, wantonly harming the environment, abusing or neglecting anyone\u2014a child, a mother, a father, a grandparent, an immigrant. I am not sure how one thing that harms a life can be weighted more strongly than another, but based on the reaction to Jim\u2019s now-infamous tweetstorm, it is abundantly clear that there is a segment of the Catholic Church that feels that the single issue of abortion, for lack of a better word, trumps every other evil. Somehow a vote against Mr. Trump has become synonymous with not only being a \u201cbad Catholic\u201d but ultimately, being complicit in murder. And even worse, the murder of \u201csociety\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201d[Related: I helped write the bishops\u2019 first document on Catholics and voting. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m voting Biden, not Trump.]The strangers who attacked me on Twitter using words and phrases like \u201cbaby killer\u201d and \u201cinfanticide\u201d and who even sent me ghastly photos of aborted fetuses did not have the effect they probably intended. Anyone who knows me or knows of me knows where I stand on life. I would, however, offer a gentle suggestion that anyone showing graphic photographs that depict dead bodies cease and desist immediately. Aside from it being utterly disrespectful of human life, some of us have lost babies prematurely at birth, and these images can be a form of spiritual terrorism. I do not negotiate with terrorists.These misguided extremists are not the ones who made me stop and examine my own beliefs. What challenged me the most as a Catholic were the people that I love and respect who reached out to me privately and suggested that our Catholic faith dictates that, above all, we must vote for the \u201cpro-life\u201d candidate, that I need to \u201chold my nose and vote for Trump.\u201d They don\u2019t like him. They hate everything else that he stands for, but we just have to vote for him. Maybe their priest, bishop or beehive convinced them Mr. Trump is the \u201cmost pro-life president in history,\u201d and they believed it.I am not writing this to prove them wrong; I assume if you are reading this you have eyes, ears, brains and\u00a0Google. But in my observation, Mr. Trump is only pro-Mr. Trump. Still, the hardline message from so many whom I love dearly was clear: Real Catholics vote Trump.The hardline message from so many whom I love dearly was clear: Real Catholics vote Trump.\u00a0How am I supposed to handle that?How am I supposed to handle that? I went to a Jesuit school, where my education was \u201cguided by a spirituality that seeks justice.\u201d This seemed like a perfect opportunity to dig into my Ignatian roots and\u00a0examine my conscience. So I turned to prayer and Scripture, which have gotten me through the roughest days of my life. In meditating on the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the rosary, I found myself guided to the words and actions of Jesus himself. His commandment of loving our neighbor as ourselves is paramount. But as much as \u201cgentle Jesus\u201d guides us through parables, he consistently challenged powerful leaders. He reserves his harshest words (\u201chypocrites,\u201d \u201cbrood of vipers,\u201d \u201cyou fools\u201d) not for known sinners or disbelievers but for self-righteous religious elites at the center of power whose religion had become an idol and whose message was toxic and oppressive.Has the abortion issue become an idol for some Catholics at the expense of everything else? Of course, Scripture can be misinterpreted\u2014the devil himself quotes from it. I needed to work with a guide to help me discern. Jesus gave the keys of the kingdom to St. Peter, and as Catholics we believe that the keys have been passed down through the popes. I decided to look to Pope Francis.RELATED STORIES The Passions of Jim and Jeannie GaffiganBill McGarveyThe pope has had his own strong words for American Catholics in recent months. Following the killing of George Floyd, Francis said in\u00a0a message to the people of the United States, \u201cWe cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life.\u201d The dignity of the human person extends to all of us created in his image, both in the womb and out of the womb. As a Catholic I desire to support a society that strives to protect every life. Systemic racism in our culture has led to such economic and social inequality that it is virtually impossible to have a \u201cculture of life\u201d without addressing the fact that we have been complicit in a long history of devaluing our fellow human beings based on the color of their skin or the way they came to this country.Can we really sit in our homes with our private health insurance and judge our neighbors who have nothing? How can we strive to heal the tragedy of abortion without acknowledging the deep wounds and life-threatening crises that drive people to it? How arrogant we are to condemn women of any color living in poverty, faced with the unimaginable and horrific circumstances that would drive them to seek an abortion, without taking a good look at how we have failed them by not offering adequate health care, child care, education and employment opportunities? Do we ever stop to think about how far we are from achieving a \u201cculture of life\u201d in light of the well-documented and video-recorded police brutality against Black Americans? Are refugee children, homeless pregnant women or the prisoners on death row not also \u201csociety\u2019s most vulnerable\u201d?How can we strive to heal the tragedy of abortion without acknowledging the deep wounds and life-threatening crises that drive people to it?Sure, there are wonderful third-party candidates out there who stand up for life and the whole range of Catholic social justice issues. Small parties have fought and struggled to find a voice within the two major parties but have been callously rejected by both. Some Catholic friends have advised me to simply cast a \u201cprotest vote\u201d so I can walk away with a clean heart and conscience. I\u2019ve got news for you: This is going to be a close election. There is only one candidate that has a chance to unseat President Trump.As much as some of my well-intended fellow Catholics will hate to hear this, it is crystal clear to me that the right thing to do is vote for Joe Biden. I believe it will be impossible to tackle these other issues with a president who is working overtime to sow division and hatred in this county through insults, intimidation, fear and\u00a0blatant racism. This venomous \u201cus against them\u201d mentality is trickling down, seeping into our churches and poisoning our pulpits. To a culture of life, vipers are deadly.Mercy and forgiveness are at the heart of Francis\u2019 papacy. We cannot move even an inch closer to a culture of life without a culture of love. It is true that showing love, mercy and forgiveness to persuade others to value life is much more work than sitting back and pointing fingers and judging. I am ready to start working.For the sake of Christ\u2019s sorrowful passion, have mercy on us and on the whole election.Listen next:More: Election 2020 / Donald Trump / Abortion / Catholic Social TeachingJeannie GaffiganJeannie Gaffigan is an actress, producer, writer, philanthropist, mother of five and all around comedic force.
