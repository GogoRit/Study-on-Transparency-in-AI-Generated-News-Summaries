Women discuss their experiences with unplanned pregnancy and former abortionists explain in detail how abortions work. The video goes on to suggest opportunities available to support women and their children.\n\u201cInstead of pro-life or pro-choice, is it possible for us to be pro-love? Is it possible for us to love both the mother and the baby? Maybe the answer isn\u2019t either-or,\u201d a voiceover explains at the onset of the video. \u201cWhere is God\u2019s heart at? Where is the truth and peace amidst all the chaos and lies?\u201d\nThe couple used LiveAction materials and worked with Embrace Grace, a non-profit that equips churches with knowledge of how to support single, pregnant young women in their communities.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe LaBrant Family kind of just implied that abortion is worse than the Holocaust in their new documentary,\u201d one viewer wrote online, reacting to the statistics the documentary shared comparing abortion in the United States to death rates caused by car accidents, smoking, heart disease and several genocides, including the Holocaust.\u00a0\nThough the comments on the video itself were never activated, people took to other social media platforms to share their frustrations. \u201cWhy has no one canceled the Labrant family?\u201d another person asked.\u00a0\nCole shared news on his story that Instagram took down his feed post addressing the documentary. He described how YouTube demonetized the video and removed it from the website\u2019s algorithm, which significantly decreases its reach.\n\u201cAt this point we\u2019ll leave the message in God\u2019s hands and trust that whoever is supposed to watch it, will watch it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSavannah shared her experience of becoming pregnant at 19 and recalled feeling fearful of the future. Her daughter Everleigh was born in 2012. Savannah and Cole met in 2016 and married in 2017, and share three children \u2014 Everleigh, Posie and Zealand. Savannah is currently pregnant with their fourth child.\nCole said that if even just one mother changes her mind about getting an abortion, it will have been worth it. The video also seeks to provide resources to people looking to provide aid and support for women in need.\nDr. Anthony Levatino, who has provided abortions up to 21 weeks gestation, explained that a unique genetic signature begins at conception.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you figure out here,\u201d he said, pointing to his heart, \u201cnot here,\u201d pointing to his head, \u201cthat killing a baby this big for money is wrong, it doesn\u2019t take you too long to figure out that it doesn\u2019t matter if the baby is this big, or this big, or even this big. It\u2019s all the same.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHe shared that he\u2019s often heard the phrase, \u201cWe need abortion to save women\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\u201cThe vast majority of times that a pregnancy becomes dangerous to a woman \u2014 there are a few cases early in pregnancy, we can talk about those \u2014 but the vast, vast number of these cases occur after 22 weeks, when the baby is viable,\u201d Levatino said. \u201cAs a pro-life obstetrician gynecologist and almost 10 years experience, I have terminated, i.e., ended, hundreds of pregnancies to save women\u2019s lives. How many babies did I have to deliberately kill in the process? None. Not even one. It\u2019s called delivery.\u201d\nThe LaBrants speak with two mothers about how crucial support during their unplanned pregnancies was for them and how women searching for help now can get it, specifically discussing Embrace Grace, which provides community to when during and after pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can have your baby and your dreams too,\u201d one mother said.\u00a0\nIsrael Jones\u2019s story concludes the documentary. After the father of her unborn child left her, she attempted to go through with an abortion. She received a pill from Planned Parenthood and \u201cthey sent [her] home, to do this abortion by [her]self.\u201d\u00a0\nThree months later, after finding strange changes happening with her body, she went to the hospital, where they spotted her five-month old child on an ultrasound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt so shameful, you know? I felt so guilty. I am just so blessed to have this beautiful daughter. She\u2019s so perfect,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI literally cried tears of joy when she came out of me. I couldn\u2019t believe how beautiful she was.\u201d\nShe experienced fear of how the abortion pill she\u2019d taken would affect her daughter.\n\u201cBut God, he just made her perfect. I know that when she grows up, she\u2019s going to know that she was meant to be here and that she was loved,\u201d Jones said. \u201cGod heard my prayer, and he redeemed me. He was like, \u2018You know what? You are worthy. You can do this.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \ncancel culture\nabortion\nyoutube\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Schultz A former Register news intern and Hillsdale College graduate, Meghan Schultz works in public relations based in Washington, D.C.
