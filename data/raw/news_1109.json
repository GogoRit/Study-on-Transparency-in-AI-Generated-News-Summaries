Is nationwide action by Congress the next frontier?By Isaac ChotinerJune 28, 2022The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has implications for legal readings of constitutional clauses regarding commerce and due process, among other topics.Photograph by Nathan Howard / GettySave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyLast week, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion and returning the issue to the states, many of which have already enacted harsh bans on the procedure. Some Republicans have floated the possibility of a federal statute banning abortion nationwide; Democrats, meanwhile, have spoken of a federal law codifying Roe, but haven\u2019t been able to overcome the Senate\u2019s filibuster math. To discuss what\u2019s in store, and how the Court might view legislative responses to the decision, I spoke by phone with Leah Litman, an assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan and a co-host of the \u201cStrict Scrutiny\u201d podcast. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we touched on the different legal approaches the Court would take in assessing  a national law that either bans or enshrines abortion, the distinct threats to abortion laws in blue states, and whether disagreements among the Court\u2019s conservatives, as embodied in the concurring opinions written by Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh, offer any real room for compromise.If Republicans take power in Congress and the White House, perhaps in 2024, they may try to pass a federal law banning abortion. How would the Supreme Court view such a ban? Does the decision last week provide any hints?At minimum, this opinion makes clear that a majority of the Court believes that such legislation would not violate the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment on the ground that it infringes on unenumerated, fundamental rights to privacy or abortion, or violates the equal-protection principles that are incorporated into the same amendment. What it doesn\u2019t answer, however, is whether a majority of the Court would believe that Congress possesses the authority under its enumerated or delegated powers to enact that legislation.There are at least two bases on which Congress might enact a federal abortion ban. One would be under its power to regulate interstate commerce. Some of the conservative Justices have adopted a pretty limited reading of Congress\u2019s powers to regulate interstate commerce, but there could be some ways for a Republican legislature to write a statute that makes it more likely to be upheld on Commerce Clause grounds. Say [Congress] writes a statute that says, \u201cNo abortion can be performed if it uses any device that has travelled in interstate commerce or any medication that contains a component that has travelled in interstate commerce.\u201dThe second basis is that Congress might say, \u201cWe are enacting this legislation under our power to enforce Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. We believe that fetuses are people. Therefore, we are enforcing and protecting fetal personhood and rights to life.\u201d Would the six conservatives conclude that Congress lacks the authority to enact either version of the statute, or reject both of those theories? I don\u2019t think we know. Chief Justice Roberts has taken more expansive views of Congress\u2019s power.So the Chief Justice, despite having more qualms about this decision than the other five conservatives, actually has a more expansive view of congressional power, and so he may be more likely to uphold a congressional ban?Yes, exactly.The counter-argument would be that a federal law banning abortion violates the Commerce Clause by getting the federal government too involved in state actions. Is that accurate?Yes. That\u2019s an argument under the Commerce Clause, but the Court\u2019s cases right now allow Congress to regulate more traditional areas of state concern if they include what\u2019s called a jurisdictional hook. That is, limit the statute to regulating procedures that involve some element of interstate commerce.What\u2019s the upshot of that? That they could find a way to ban abortion nationwide, essentially?Exactly.You alluded to this when you mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014there is stuff in the decision just about protecting life. That reading would seem to give Congress fairly broad powers to do what it wished, right?That\u2019s exactly right. If you read the section of the opinion that explains why Mississippi\u2019s statute is constitutional under the new standard of review that the Court announced, the Court basically says in a single paragraph that Mississippi viewed fetuses as unborn human beings and that that was a rational basis for it to act on. Even for Justices like, say, Justice Clarence Thomas, who have a narrower reading of the Commerce Clause, I can easily imagine them embracing the theory that Congress could view fetuses as human beings, and therefore ban abortion on that basis.What about flipping it the other way? It doesn\u2019t seem like Democrats anytime soon are going to get rid of the filibuster and codify a bill into law that protects the right to abortion, but how do you think this Court might look at such a law? We\u2019ve been hearing for a long time from conservatives that the importance of getting rid of Roe was to bring this power back to the people and their legislators. I\u2019m curious how you think a conservative Court might view a law codifying Roe.I\u2019m extremely skeptical that they would allow Congress to codify a federal right to abortion. They are much more likely to conclude that such a statute exceeds Congress\u2019s powers because they don\u2019t believe that there is any right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment that Congress might be safeguarding if it enacted a federal protection for abortion. So that possible basis for the law goes out, and that leaves the Commerce Clause. Given how easy it has been for [the Court] to find ways to strike down statutes that they don\u2019t like under the Commerce Clause\u2014like in N.F.I.B. v. Sebelius, on the Affordable Care Act\u2014I\u2019m not at all confident that they would say, \u201cYes, Congress has the authority to codify Roe or the right to an abortion.\u201dThere has been a slight tension in progressive commentary between this idea that Democrats in Washington have to do something, have to codify Roe and get rid of the filibuster, and, at the same time, this idea that the Court will do whatever it wants. I don\u2019t see why the Court in its current makeup would allow a national bill to stand. It doesn\u2019t quite seem like a long-term solution.I don\u2019t see it differently. I guess I would just say two things. One is that I don\u2019t want the White House or Congress to not be doing things just because they think that the Court will strike them down. I mean, my goodness, the Court is poised to tell the E.P.A. that it can\u2019t regulate climate change. I don\u2019t think that should stop Democrats from trying. I do think it means they have to figure out how to address this conservative wrecking ball that is standing in front of them.Did anything in the concurring opinions by Roberts and Kavanaugh strike you as notable for abortion law going forward, or abortion cases that liberals could have some faith in winning?The only passage in either concurrence that falls into that category would be the passage in Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence, in which he says that he doesn\u2019t think states have the authority to criminalize residents going to other states to obtain abortions. We\u2019ve already seen some legislatures floating or enacting laws that would criminalize residents of Texas going to New York to get an abortion. Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion indicates that he doesn\u2019t believe those laws are constitutional. He thinks that they would violate the right to travel, which, as I\u2019m sure you know, is not in the text of the Constitution, either, and yet he thinks that one exists.And the Roberts concurrence?It\u2019s just an indication of how, frankly, irrelevant he has become on this Court. His vote isn\u2019t needed, so he can\u2019t craft these kinds of compromises that people used to laud him for.What were your first thoughts about the dissent\u2014how it was crafted and what it was arguing?Two things struck me about the dissent. One is that I thought it was very well done, in particular how they centered the impact that this decision will have on women and their lives. I appreciated that. Second is that they encouraged everyone to worry about where this Court is headed next. They likened what the Court was doing to toppling a Jenga tower of rights, and repeatedly underscored that what was guiding the majority opinion was nothing approximating law. It\u2019s power. I think the combination of those statements, and others, were really a call for people to worry about this as not the end. It\u2019s just the beginning of what this Court might do.There have always been some complaints, even from progressive lawyers, that Roe, despite its important impact on the country and for women, was not necessarily the most well-reasoned decision. Did anything from the dissent suggest how a progressive rebirth on the Court at some future point would view abortion law, and how it might be similar or different from Roe?I don\u2019t think the dissenters really offered a theory on how they would bring back Roe on alternative grounds. They defended Roe on its existing basis. Namely, it falls within an unenumerated right to privacy. I personally think, as other scholars have suggested, and as the former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested, that one of the best arguments for a right to an abortion is on equal-protection grounds\u2014that access to abortion, the ability to control when and whether you have a child, is fundamental to women\u2019s ability to participate equally in society. Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s majority opinion writes out that argument in the span of a paragraph, insisting that it\u2019s foreclosed by precedent in an opinion in which he overrules another precedent. [Alito discounts the theory that abortion rights can find a \u201cpotential home\u201d in the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because earlier precedents \u201cestablish that a State\u2019s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification.\u201d] In the future, in a different world with a different Court, there is some possibility for that argument to become the basis for the legal right to an abortion.What did you make of the dissent focussing on a right to abortion, rather than a broader conception of reproductive freedom?They also located the right to an abortion within a broader umbrella of a right to privacy and a right to bodily autonomy, as well as a right to autonomy over decisions regarding parentage. They cite Skinner v. Oklahoma about the right not to be sterilized without consent. So I do think that they link it to other decisions that suggest there is a broader right to reproductive freedom, but they are specific about abortion in this case.Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence has some lines about where the Court might go or where he would like to see the Court go, in terms of issues such as gay marriage, which I gather Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence shoots down to some extent. Are there five votes for anything specific that you\u2019re worried about? What areas of the law might be particularly at risk?In the immediate short term, I am very nervous about state restrictions on forms of contraception that states or the conservative legal movement label as forms of abortion or as abortifacients, whether that\u2019s IUDs or the morning-after pill. I am worried that states will test the argument that, because those are forms of contraception they view as abortion, this decision allows them to criminalize those forms of contraception. It\u2019s a very real short-term risk given that the Court, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, said that employers didn\u2019t have to abide by the contraception mandate under the Affordable Care Act, and that they were entitled to view certain forms of contraception as methods of abortion. That is on the table in the short term.The other decisions that I am very worried about include Griswold, a broader right to contraception; Lawrence v. Texas, the right to consensual, same-sex intimacy; and Obergefell v. Hodges, marriage equality. I don\u2019t think those decisions are under threat tomorrow, maybe not even in the next five years. But I am concerned that we are going to see states chipping away [at those rights], in the same way we saw with abortion. And that culminated in an outright reversal of Roe. Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence, frankly, doesn\u2019t give me a lot of hope or faith. He rejects the idea of fetal personhood, the idea that the Constitution itself criminalizes abortion. But I don\u2019t know where he will be, let\u2019s say, in five years or ten years or fifteen years on Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell, if that\u2019s where the other Justices and the conservative legal movement and Republican politicians are going.In practical terms, you\u2019re saying that, even if Obergefell is not going to be reversed, the Court will still allow states to go further than we might have thought toward restricting established rights?Yes, exactly. I\u2019m thinking back, for example, to the Court\u2019s decision in Pavan v. Smith, in which the old Court, the one with Justice Anthony Kennedy on it, said that states couldn\u2019t make it harder for same-sex couples to be listed on the birth certificate for their child. Now the Court could say that states can do that without issuing an opinion that formally overrules Obergefell, and so those are the kinds of limits and chipping away at Obergefell that I am concerned about, which would allow states to discriminate against same-sex families in ways other than formally denying a marriage license.You talked about why a national law codifying Roe might be unlikely to be upheld. Are you concerned, separately from a national ban, that abortion laws in blue states could come under attack?In blue states, we\u2019ve already seen some abortion laws coming under attack on First Amendment grounds. California\u2019s law required unlicensed crisis pregnancy centers to disclose that they were unlicensed, and it required licensed facilities to basically inform individuals that the state would pay for some forms of abortion. The Court struck that down, in Becerra. So, yes, I am concerned that the Court will limit blue states\u2019 ability to provide information about how to obtain abortions.What is the reasoning?The reasoning from that opinion was that California required providers that didn\u2019t provide abortions to inform their patients that abortions were an option for them. The Court said that you couldn\u2019t require providers to speak about abortion if they didn\u2019t want to. So that\u2019s just one possible theory that might limit a state\u2019s ability to require health-care providers or other professionals to inform people about their rights to abortion under blue-state laws.There is also this theory of fetal personhood, as well as possible limits on blue states\u2019 ability to offer services to individuals who have left their state to get an abortion and then go back, and whether a state such as Texas could prosecute a California provider or a patient who went to California. I\u2019m not quite as concerned about that in light of the Kavanaugh concurrence, but I am still concerned about it because there is uncertainty, and that might make people more reticent to offer services to individuals coming from abortion deserts.\u00a0\u2666More on Abortion and Roe v.
