Minister of Health Roberto Speranza announced last weekend on social media revisions to outdated national guidance, which will ease restrictions on medical abortion \u2013 a safe way to end a pregnancy using medication rather than more invasive surgical methods.\nThe announcement \u2013 as the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbates existing barriers to legal abortion in Italy \u2013 comes none too soon for women like \u201cElisabetta,\u201d who sought a medical abortion after discovering she was pregnant in early April. \u201cI called all the hospitals of Milano province,\u201d she said. \u201cSome said they had suspended the service [because of Covid-19], some said they don\u2019t do it at all.\u201d By the time Elisabetta found a hospital providing abortions in a town about 60 kilometers away, the doctor said she was past the legal time limit for medical abortion.\nUntil now, medical abortion has been permitted in Italy only until the seventh week of pregnancy \u2013 when some people may not even know they are pregnant \u2013 and national guidance says it should be administered during a three-day hospitalization. Yet the World Health Organization (WHO) says medical abortion can be safely self-managed by women up to the twelfth week of pregnancy. While surgical abortion can be performed in outpatient hospitals throughout Italy, only 5 of 20 regions have permitted outpatient medical abortion.\nBut following pressure from local organizations, the health ministry has indicated that new guidelines will allow medical abortion on an outpatient basis up to the ninth week of pregnancy.\nImproved medical abortion access will help ensure implementation of Italy\u2019s national law, which permits abortion during the first 90 days of pregnancy for any reason. But burdensome requirements and medical personnel\u2019s extensive use of \u201cconscientious objection\u201d to deny services leave women like Elisabetta scrambling to find care within the legal time frame. Though Italian law requires authorities to ensure that conscientious objection does not prevent legal abortion, this is not upheld or enforced.\nThese changes to Italy\u2019s national guidance on medical abortion are critical to getting women and girls the health care they need. The government should monitor regional health authorities to ensure they implement these measures and uphold the national law and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 reproductive rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia Italy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKazakhstan: Women\u2019s Rights Activist Targeted with Dubious Fraud Charges \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKyrgyzstan: Domestic Violence Against Women, Girls with Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cViolence with Every Step\u201d\n\n\nWeak State Response to Domestic Violence in Tajikistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKazakhstan: Women\u2019s Rights Activist Targeted with Dubious Fraud Charges \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nKyrgyzstan: Domestic Violence Against Women, Girls with Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
