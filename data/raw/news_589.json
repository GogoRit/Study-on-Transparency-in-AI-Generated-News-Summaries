This removed one of the last legal avenues for women to terminate a pregnancy in a country that already has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe.\u00a0AdvertisementNews\u2018We Are Governed By Morons': Poland's Leading Pro-Choice ActivistPawe\u0142 M\u0105czewski01.25.21Following the ruling, hundreds of thousands of people took part in months-long demonstrations, led by women, in cities across Poland, at a scale not seen in decades. The mass movement initially forced a partial climbdown from the ruling right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS), as the government delayed implementing the new measure which, according to Polish law, should have come into effect days after the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s October ruling. Still, the government\u2019s decision to postpone enacting the law didn\u2019t stop hospitals from pre-emptively cancelling abortions. In the days following the ruling, Polish reproductive rights organisations reported a rise in the number of women seeking advice and travelling to other countries for abortions.News'No More Compromise' \u2013 Pro-Choice Protesters in Poland Vow to Fight On Tim Hume11.02.20Unable to ignore the scale of the protests, Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, initially called for talks with pro-choice groups, signalling that the government was listening to concerns and open to finding a compromise.\u00a0Pro-choice protesters hold up banners during a protest on the 27th of January in Warsaw, Poland. Photo by Omar Marques/Getty ImagesBut any chance of a full climbdown were ended on Wednesday afternoon when the government abruptly announced that in just a few hours, it would be publishing the high court\u2019s decision in the country\u2019s Journal of Laws, the final step needed to officially action a new ruling.\u00a0NewsPoland\u2019s Abortion Ban Is Already Having a Chilling EffectTim Hume11.19.20Hours after the announcement, thousands of protesters returned to the streets of Warsaw and other major cities.\u00a0The demonstrations were organised by the Polish Women's Strike \u2013 Poland\u2019s largest pro-choice group. Early this week, in an interview with VICE World News, the group\u2019s co-founder, Marta Lempart, predicted that the government would eventually go through with the ban because they were afraid to \u201cshow weakness to their conservative voters and lose to the [far-right] Confederation party who pretend they're libertarians, while, in fact, they\u2019re regular neo-fascists.\u201dNews'There Is No Turning Back' \u2013 Polish Women Undeterred by Threat of Far-Right Violence Tim Hume, Nina Zabicka10.30.20The ruling, which came into effect at midnight, means that abortions are now limited to cases of rape and incest, or if the mother\u2019s life is in danger \u2013 scenarios that represent about 2 percent of all abortions in the staunchly Catholic nation.\u00a0\u00a0Tagged:worldnewsVICE Internationalabortionswomen's rightsGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
