(AP) \u2014 The GOP\u2019s nominee for Nevada governor said Thursday he would fight against a national abortion ban if Congress were to pass one.\u201cIt\u2019s the vote of the people within the state of Nevada, and I will support that,\u201d Joe Lombardo, who is generally anti-abortion, told reporters while campaigning in the state with Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. \u201cThat is an issue that doesn\u2019t need to be in politics.\u201dNevada voters codified the right to abortion up to 24 weeks into law in a 1990 referendum. Any order to further restrict abortion would have to come from a vote of the people, not the state legislature, unlike in many other states.Earlier this week, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham proposed a near-total abortion ban after 15 weeks. The legislation undermined many GOP candidates\u2019 arguments this summer that the future of abortion rights in the U.S. would be decided by individual states.\n\nLombardo, who is the Clark County sheriff, has long maintained that as governor he would respect the 1990 vote though he is Catholic and holds anti-abortion views.Still, a nationwide abortion ban would supersede Nevada law, and it is unclear how Lombardo could fight one.\nLombardo\u2019s announcement came in contrast to some Republicans who have shied away or supported Graham\u2019s proposal. Republican April Becker, a candidate in Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, opposes abortion except for instances of rape and incest. But she told NBC News this week that she would vote against a nationwide abortion ban, calling it unconstitutional for Congress to regulate abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on Thursday, New Mexico\u2019s Republican governor nominee proposed a referendum that could place new limitations on abortion access.Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade, Nevada Gov. Sisolak signed an executive order saying Nevada will not assist other states that try to prosecute residents who travel to Nevada for abortions. It also ensures medical boards and commissions that oversee medical licenses do not discipline or disqualify doctors who provide abortions.\n\nThough he has stepped back from when he said he would overturn the executive order, Lombardo has maintained that he would \u201clook at it from the lens of being a pro-life governor.\u201dAfter Thursday\u2019s rally, Sisolak spokesperson Natalie Gould released a statement saying \u201cJoe Lombardo is lying.\u201dLombardo and Youngkin spent the day holding events in both Las Vegas and Reno, where the Virginia governor evoked his own high-profile victory a year ago.Lombardo attacked the Democratic incumbent Sisolak on education, crime and for closing nonessential businesses early in the COVID-19 pandemic. He talked of further diversifying Nevada\u2019s economy, more power for school decision-making to parents and expanding charter schools.\u201cThis was a movement,\u201d Youngkin said of his victory later on. \u201cAnd that movement is here now. It\u2019s your turn.\u201d___Stern is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
