Newsroom, Sep 26, 2022 / 15:00 pm\nThe FBI is disputing published accounts of a \u201cSWAT\u201d raid on a pro-life Catholic family\u2019s home in Pennsylvania last week.\nThe alleged circumstances of the Sept. 23 arrest of Mark Houck, a 48-year-old father of seven, have led to a public outcry about what many view as an unnecessarily aggressive show of force.\nHouck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie Houck, told CNA that a large contingent of federal law enforcement officials arrived early that morning outside the family\u2019s home in Kintnersville in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cA SWAT team of about 25 came to my house with about 15 vehicles and started pounding on our door,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey said they were going to break in if he didn\u2019t open it. And then they had about five guns pointed at my husband, myself, and basically at my kids,\u201d she added.\nOn Monday the FBI disputed her account.\n\u201cThere are inaccurate claims being made regarding the arrest of Mark Houck,\u201d the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia office said in a statement.\n\u201cNo SWAT Team or SWAT operators were involved. FBI agents knocked on Mr. Houck\u2019s front door, identified themselves as FBI agents, and asked him to exit the residence. He did so and was taken into custody without incident pursuant to an indictment,\u201d the statement continued.\nAn FBI spokesman declined to answer CNA\u2019s questions about the number of law enforcement personnel at the scene and whether any drew their weapons and pointed them at the family.\n\u201cExtensive planning takes place prior to the service of any federal warrant. The FBI then employs the personnel and tactics deemed necessary to effect a safe arrest or search,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s the FBI\u2019s standard practice not to discuss such operational specifics, we can say that the number of personnel and vehicles widely reported as being on scene Friday is an overstatement, and the tactics used by FBI personnel were professional, in line with standard practices, and intended to ensure the safety of everyone present in and outside the residence,\u201d the statement concluded.\nBrian Middleton, who has acted as the Houck family\u2019s spokesperson, responded to the FBI\u2019s statement.\n\u201cThey\u2019re turning this into a technical conversation about the representation of a woman who on Friday morning was awakened by a bunch of FBI agents armed with automatic weapons, some of them with body armor \u2026 pointing automatic weapons at her and her husband when they arrived in front of their children,\u201d Middleton told CNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is absurd. If they\u2019re not going to tell us the number, what they\u2019re trying to do is make it look as if the Houcks aren\u2019t telling the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a math contest. The issue is excessive force for the crime of maybe pushing another person.\u201d\nMiddleton noted that publicist Tom Ciesieka will be taking over the role of family spokesman.\nAltercation on video\nMark Houck, the founder and co-president of a men\u2019s spiritual formation apostolate called\u00a0The King\u2019s Men, faces the possibility of 11 years in prison if convicted of violating the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, more commonly referred to as the FACE Act.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law carries stiff penalties for those who engage in \u201cviolent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services,\u201d according to the Department of Justice.\nA federal indictment accuses Houck of twice assaulting a Planned Parenthood client escort, identified in the document as \u201cB.L.,\u201d outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic on Oct. 23, 2021.\nHouck regularly prays the rosary, hands out literature, and \u201cdoes some sidewalk counseling\u201d outside the clinic, his wife told CNA.\nMark Houck maintains that he pushed the clinic escort away from Houck\u2019s then 12-year-old son because the man was verbally harassing the boy, Middleton told CNA.\nThe man fell down but was not seriously hurt, Middleton said, requiring only \u201ca Band-Aid on his finger.\u201d\nMark Houck with two of his seven children. Courtesy of the Houck family\nMiddleton said the altercation was captured on camera, though he said Sunday that the Houcks were still trying to locate the video.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nMiddleton said after local authorities declined to press charges, the escort pressed charges in Philadelphia municipal court, but the case was dismissed when the man repeatedly failed to show up for court dates.\nAs of Monday afternoon, an\u00a0online fund drive\u00a0for the Houck family has raised more than $191,000.\nDefended by Thomas More Society\nHouck\u2019s arraignment on the charges is scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Philadelphia. In a press release issued Monday, the Thomas More Society nonprofit legal firm announced it is representing Houck.\nThe law firm said one-on-one altercations like the one involving Houck do not fall under the federal FACE Act, citing a decision in a\u00a0similar case\u00a0Thomas More lawyers won in June 2019 on behalf of a sidewalk counselor.\n\u201cThis case is being brought solely to intimidate people of faith and pro-life Americans,\u201d Peter Breen, a Thomas More vice president and senior counselor, said in a statement. \u201cMark Houck is innocent of these lawless charges, and we intend to prove that in court.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law firm said it informed the Department of Justice in June that if Houck were charged he would turn himself in voluntarily.\n\u201cRather than accepting Mark Houck\u2019s offer to appear voluntarily, the Biden Department of Justice chose to make an unnecessary show of potentially deadly force, sending 20 heavily armed federal agents to the Houck residence at dawn this past Friday,\u201d Breen said.\n\u201cIn threatening form, after nearly breaking down the family\u2019s front door, at least five agents pointed guns at Mark\u2019s head and arrested him in front of his wife and seven young children, who were terrified that their husband and father would be shot dead before their eyes.\u201d\nAccounts of how Houck was taken into custody have been met with sharp criticism from GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\u201cI want to know from Merrick Garland directly why Biden\u2019s DOJ is arresting Catholic protestors like terrorists \u2014 complete with SWAT-style tactics \u2014 while letting actual terrorist acts like firebombings go unpunished,\u201d Hawley said in a tweet.\nWilliam Donohue, president of the Catholic League, wrote a letter to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, imploring him to \u201cget to the bottom of this duplicity.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI am not in a position to judge the veracity of the account offered by the FBI or Houck. But it surely seems that the FBI overreacted in its handling of this matter. Houck had seven children at home as the SWAT team pounded on his door, showing up fully armored, yelling at him to open it,\u201d Donohue wrote.\n\u201cThis kind of overreaction for a minor infraction of the law is deeply troubling, and it becomes even more troubling when paired with the underreaction by the Department of Justice when the pro-life side is targeted,\u201d the letter said.\nDonohue wrote in June to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking him to \u201cimmediately deploy the full resources of the Department of Justice to apprehend and prosecute domestic terrorists who have recently attacked Catholic individuals, vandalized Catholic churches, and torched Catholic-operated crisis pregnancy centers.\u201d\n\u201cNot only did I not receive a response from the attorney general, there have been no news stories on SWAT teams crashing the homes of abortion-rights terrorists,\u201d Donohue said in the letter to Grassley.\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPro-life advocacy, \nFBI, \nFACE Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Mullen is the editor-in-chief of the National Catholic Register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Bukuras is a journalist at the Catholic News Agency.\u00a0 Joe has prior experience working in state and federal government, in non-profits, and Catholic education.
