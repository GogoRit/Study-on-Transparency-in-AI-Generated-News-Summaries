Church and state have merged, giving birth to conflict and contradiction. A woman\u2019s right to choose is under siege, the LGBTQIA+ community is treated like second-class citizens, and sex education is being phased out.Poland has the strictest abortion legislation in the EU. Abortion is illegal with three exceptions [in cases of rape, incest or where there\u2019s a threat to the mother\u2019s life], and these exceptions are being slowly erased. This will affect not just our women, but our entire community. On 22 October, the Constitutional Court outlawed abortion in the case of severe and irreversible foetal impairment. This basically means that the state will force women to carry their pregnancies to term and give birth to children with severe deformities who may die, in extreme pain, just minutes after. The state is starting to interfere with our most personal decisions that impact our life, our destiny, our health and safety.Read MoreWhy An Abortion Was The Right Choice For Me: 5 Women Share Their StoryBy Emily ChanA woman\u2019s right to choose is the litmus test for a healthy and progressive society. This moment in time will affect the Polish community for decades to come. Our women \u2013 our mothers, wives and daughters of the future \u2013 are relying on us to put them first.(Photo by Omar Marques/Getty Images)\nOmar MarquesMost PopularNewsIf Anyone Can Bring Back Skinny Jeans, It\u2019s Kate MossBy Hannah JacksonNewsSydney Sweeney Just Found A Genuinely Novel Way Not To Wear Clothes On The Red CarpetBy Hayley MaitlandFashionH&M X Rokh May Just Be The Brand\u2019s Best Collaboration To DateBy Joy MontgomeryMeanwhile, the LGBTQIA+ community in Poland lives in fear. We are a sum of parts, and to allow a faction to be marginalised or discriminated against is abhorrent and cowardly. So much of this behaviour is fear-based and ignorant. A Polish church that picks and chooses its dogma to manipulate an outcome is a direct contradiction of where Pope Francis is leading the Catholic faith in 2020 and beyond. To those who are LGBTQIA+ phobic, I would ask you to confront your fears and be better. Poland is better than this. We are better than this.I started a sex-education foundation in Poland in 2017 [called SexedPL]. It wasn\u2019t as much a passion project, as it was a practical solution. For thousands of years, sex has been part of our lives, beyond algebra and physics. We are here, every single one of us, at a cellular level, because of sex. How is it possible to imagine a healthy community where we don\u2019t teach our children about their bodies, their personal boundaries, consent and safe sex? Sex is inherently personal, comes with deep insecurities and dangers, and to simply ignore or reject it is irresponsible and a step backwards for Poland. In 2020, the Polish government is doing its best to censor and ultimately ban sex education. The adults of tomorrow face an isolated and uncertain future without the very best community care and structured education. Our government\u2019s attack on sex education is an attack on our children.Read MoreDakota Johnson Is Here To Remind You That Sexual Wellness Is Self-CareBy Lauren ValentiThere are moments and days where I feel deflated and terrified. Let me be clear: I feel I\u2019m no more significant than the next Polish citizen. My family and community are riddled with anxiety and uncertainty. I watch the protests on the streets, provoked by the abortion ruling, with a mixture of pride and terror as I wonder how our Poland has become this place. After all we have faced over the past 100 years \u2013 the adversity, the heroes, the lessons learned \u2013 we find ourselves here. I try to stay positive and do everything in my power to support the men and women rebelling against oppression and fighting for our freedom, and the recognition of human rights. During low moments, I share phone calls and conversations with my friends and restore my confidence that we can make the change by being brave and speaking out.We have learned many things during our lifetime, but a fundamental that underpins us is that \u2018our Poland\u2019 has the ability to thrive and adapt during crises. There is goodness in every single one of us. We need to remain calm, listen, focus and never undermine our own integrity. We are only free when everyone is equal.Most PopularNewsIf Anyone Can Bring Back Skinny Jeans, It\u2019s Kate MossBy Hannah JacksonNewsSydney Sweeney Just Found A Genuinely Novel Way Not To Wear Clothes On The Red CarpetBy Hayley MaitlandFashionH&M X Rokh May Just Be The Brand\u2019s Best Collaboration To DateBy Joy MontgomeryA near-total abortion ban took effect in Poland on 27 January.More from British Vogue:Arts & LifestyleViewpointHealthVogue RecommendsNewsWhat\u2019s Happening On The Frontline Of Poland\u2019s Pro-Choice Movement?By Agata PyzikOscars 202110 Women Directors That Deserve An Oscar Nomination This YearBy Radhika SethArts & Lifestyle\u201cI Became A Free Woman\u201d: Le\u00efla Slimani On Leaving Social MediaBy Amanda RandoneSexWe Need To Talk About The Links Between Sex, Race And ColonialismBy Almaz OheneFacebookInstagramXYouTubeMore from VogueFashionBeautyArts & LifestyleRunwayShoppingNewsVideoVogue ShopPhotoVogueCond\u00e9 Nast BritainCN TravellerGlamourGQHouse & GardenJohansensTatlerVanity FairWiredWorld of InteriorsPrivacy Policy & Cookie StatementCode of ConductTerms & ConditionsContactEditorial Complaints PolicyCareersNewsletterSubscribe\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 NastSelect international siteBritainLargeChevronArabiaAustraliaBrasilChinaCzechoslovakiaEspa\u00f1aFranceGermanyGreeceHong KongIndiaItaliaJapanKoreaM\u00e9xicoNederlandPhilippinesPolskaPortugalScandinaviaSingaporeTaiwanThailandT\u00fcrkiyeUkraineUnited States"
