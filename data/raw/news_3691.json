Wade\nSupreme Court justices\u2019 abortion views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs abortion a constitutional right?\n\nNot under the U.S. Constitution, according to the current Supreme Court. In\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0(2022), the Supreme Court overturned\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0(1973), which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. Some state constitutions, however, independently protect abortion rights.\nIn\u00a0Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decided that the right to privacy implied in the 14th Amendment protected abortion as a fundamental right. However, the government retained the power to regulate or restrict abortion access depending on the stage of pregnancy. And after fetal viability, outright bans on abortion were permitted if they contained exceptions to preserve life and health.\u00a0\nFor the following 49 years, states, health care providers, and citizens fought over what limits the government could place on abortion access, particularly during the second and third trimesters. But abortion was fundamentally legal in all 50 states during that period.\nWriting for the majority in\u00a0Dobbs, Justice Samuel Alito said that the only legitimate unenumerated rights \u2014\u00a0that is, rights not explicitly stated in the Constitution \u2014 are those \u201cdeeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d and \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Abortion, the majority held, is not such a right.\u00a0\nFollowing\u00a0Dobbs, reproductive rights are being decided state by state.\u00a0Constitutions in 10 states\u00a0\u2014 Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, and New Mexico \u2014 have been interpreted by state high courts to guarantee the right to abortion or protect access more strongly than the federal constitution. Other state legislatures have passed laws protecting abortion rights. Many states, however, have\u00a0made abortion illegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoe v. Wade\n\nThe road to\u00a0Roe\nAbortion was illegal in most states in the 1960s, often with no exceptions for cases of rape or threat to life. A pair of high-profile crises, however, shined a spotlight on the impact of these restrictions.\nBeginning in the late 1950s, thousands of babies were born with severe birth defects after their mothers took the morning sickness drug thalidomide while pregnant. The most well-known\u00a0case was that of Sherri Finkbine, a host of the children\u2019s television program\u00a0Romper Room, who was forced to travel to Sweden to obtain an abortion. A Gallup poll showed, perhaps surprisingly given the legal backdrop, that a majority of Americans\u00a0supported\u00a0Finkbine\u2019s decision.\nShortly after the thalidomide scandal, an epidemic of rubella, or German measles, swept across the country. Babies that survived rubella in utero were often born with a\u00a0wide range of disabilities\u00a0such as deafness, heart defects, and liver damage. (A\u00a0rubella vaccine\u00a0didn\u2019t become available until 1971.)\nIt was in this environment of maternal risk that high-profile doctors like\u00a0Alan Guttmacher\u00a0began to argue publicly that abortion should be treated like other medical procedures \u2014 as a decision to be made between physician and patient.\nGriswold v. Connecticut\u00a0(1965)\nWhile thalidomide and rubella impacted public perspectives on abortion, a series of cases built the foundation for the coming revolution in abortion law. The first involved the right to contraception, and the story begins in the 19th century.\nIn 1879, Connecticut senator P.T. Barnum (yes,\u00a0that\u00a0P.T. Barnum)\u00a0introduced a bill\u00a0barring not only contraceptives but also\u00a0the distribution of information relating to them. The Barnum Act was still on the books in Connecticut in 1960, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first oral contraceptive. Estelle Griswold, executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, was fined $100 for violating the law. Her appeal went all the way to the Supreme Court.\nIn\u00a0Griswold v. Connecticut, a seven-justice majority struck down the Barnum Act. Justice William O. Douglas explained that the Bill of Rights implies a right to privacy because when viewed as a coherent whole, it focuses on limiting government intrusions. The\u00a0Griswold\u00a0majority held that the government cannot prevent married couples from accessing contraception. (At the time, the justices did not extend the right to unmarried people.)\u00a0Griswold\u2019s contention that the Constitution creates a zone of privacy into which the government cannot enter paved the way for\u00a0Roe, among other landmark decisions.\nEisenstadt v. Baird\u00a0(1972)\nThe road from\u00a0Griswold\u00a0to\u00a0Roe\u00a0was not perfectly straight. Two years after\u00a0Griswold, reproductive rights activist\u00a0William Baird\u00a0offered contraceptives to an unmarried woman after a lecture on contraception to students at Boston University. He was sentenced to three months in prison.\nLike Estelle Griswold, Baird appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. In\u00a0Eisenstadt v. Baird, the Justices extended\u00a0Griswold. Justice William Brennan, writing for the six-justice majority, explained that the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law. There was no reason to treat married and unmarried people differently with regard to contraception.\nUnited States v. Vuitch\u00a0(1971)\u00a0\nOver the course of nine years,\u00a0Washington, DC,\u2013based physician Milan Vuitch was\u00a0arrested 16 times\u00a0for performing abortions, which had been illegal in the district since 1901 except \u201cas necessary for the preservation of the mother\u2019s life or health.\u201d\nVuitch appealed his eventual conviction, arguing in part that the exception for \u201chealth\u201d was unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court disagreed in\u00a0United States v. Vuitch. Taking a broad view of the word \u201chealth,\u201d the justices ruled that abortion was legal in the district whenever necessary to protect mental or physical health.\nThe significance of\u00a0Vuitch, however, was to be short-lived.\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0was already wending its way through the courts by the time of the decision. The day after they decided\u00a0Vuitch, the justices voted to hear\u00a0Roe.\u00a0\nThe parties to\u00a0Roe\nTexan Norma McCorvey became pregnant for the third time in 1969. Struggling with drug and alcohol use, she previously relinquished responsibility for her first two children. She decided that she did not want to continue the pregnancy.\u00a0\nTexas law, however, allowed abortion only to save the patient\u2019s life. With McCorvey six months pregnant, Texas lawyers Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington filed a suit on her behalf in federal court under the pseudonym Jane Roe.\nHenry Wade was a legendary and\u00a0controversial\u00a0district attorney with an impressive conviction rate, most famous for prosecuting\u00a0Jack Ruby, who killed JFK\u2019s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Wade was, however, an odd foil for pro-choice activists. He did not aggressively prosecute illegal abortions and said little about them.\nThe lower court\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas\u00a0struck down\u00a0Texas\u2019s abortion ban, finding it overbroad and locating the right to reproductive choice in the 9th and 14th Amendments. Citing\u00a0Griswold, the court noted that the Constitution guarantees \u201cthe right of choice over events which, by their character and consequences, bear in a fundamental manner on the privacy of individuals.\u201d While the federal court declared the Texas law unconstitutional, it declined to immediately block its enforcement, putting\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0on a fast track to the Supreme Court.\nNorma McCorvey gave birth to a girl, Shelley Lynn, on June 2, 1970, fifteen days before the federal district court issued its ruling. The baby was adopted when she was three days old. Her identity was not known to the public until 2021.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0oral argument\nSarah Weddington, who was just 26 years old when she stood before the justices of the Supreme Court on December 13, 1971, built her case for the constitutional right to abortion around the 9th and 14th Amendments, arguing that \u201cmeaningful\u201d liberty must include the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.\nAlthough the justices were largely receptive to Weddington\u2019s points, Justice Byron White demanded to know whether the right to abortion extended right up to the moment of birth. After some hesitation, Weddington answered yes. Legal personhood began at birth, Weddington claimed. Until that moment, there should be an unfettered constitutional right to abortion.\nAfter Weddington sat down, Texas Assistant Attorney General Jay Floyd stood to defend the state law. He began, inexplicably, with a sexist joke: \u201cIt\u2019s an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they are going to have the last word.\u201d The bafflingly inappropriate comment was followed by three seconds of dead silence.\nThere was, however, one moment of wit in the argument. When Floyd argued that a woman who becomes pregnant has already made her choice, Justice Potter Stewart shot back, \u201cMaybe she makes a choice when she decides to live in Texas!\u201d The retort brought roars of laughter from the gallery.\nOf particular note is how little the oral argument focused on the history of abortion laws during the founding or the post\u2013Civil War era when the 14th Amendment was ratified. The justices focused instead on the biological realities of abortion and the text of the Constitution itself.\nAlso interesting: Justice Harry Blackmun, who would write the majority opinion in\u00a0Roe v. Wade, spoke only twice during the oral argument. By contrast, Justice Thurgood Marshall spoke more than 10 times, Justices White and William\u00a0Brennan\u00a0more than 20 times, and Justice Stewart more than 30. (Perhaps this was because Blackmun was initially inclined to\u00a0write a much more restrained opinion\u00a0than he ultimately did.)\nThe\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0opinion\nThe Supreme Court handed down its decision on January 22, 1973. Seven of the nine justices agreed that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment \u2014 which says that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d \u2014\u00a0implies a right to privacy. The majority seized upon Weddington\u2019s definition of liberty, citing a series of prior cases indicating that the term \u201cliberty\u201d must be interpreted broadly in a free society.\nThe justices did, however, recognize that the state could place some limits on abortion if necessary to further a compelling state interest. The state\u2019s ability to regulate increased as a pregnancy progressed. And after a fetus reached viability, the state could prohibit abortion, except when necessary to protect health or life.\nJustices William Rehnquist and White dissented. Rehnquist argued that privacy, in the constitutional sense of illegal search and seizure, has nothing to do with abortion. In his view, since abortion bans implicate no fundamental rights, they must only have some rational basis, such as protecting a fetus. Foreshadowing the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0decision in 2022, Rehnquist also declared that the only recognizable rights not explicitly listed in the Constitution are those with deep roots in the American legal tradition.\nDoe v. Bolton\u00a0(1973)\nOn the same day the Supreme Court decided\u00a0Roe, it decided\u00a0Doe v. Bolton, which challenged Georgia\u2019s abortion ban. The Georgia law limited abortion to cases of documented rape, a severely disabled fetus, or a threat to life. Before the procedure, it was necessary to obtain the approval of a doctor, two additional consulting physicians, and a hospital committee. The law also permitted relatives to challenge the abortion decision. It was, in short, a burdensome process.\nIn another 7\u20132 vote, with Blackmun again writing for the majority, the Court ruled that although the rights identified in\u00a0Roe\u00a0are not absolute, Georgia\u2019s restrictions violated the constitutional right to abortion. He noted that the law established hurdles that were far higher than those that had to be overcome for other surgical procedures.\nWhite and Rehnquist again dissented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the impact of the Roe v. Wade decision?\n\nRoe\u00a0significantly reduced maternal mortality. A total of 39 women are known to have\u00a0died from unsafe abortions\u00a0in 1972, and this was almost certainly a drastic undercount. In 1975, there were only three such deaths. In 1965, eight years before\u00a0Roe\u00a0was decided, illegal abortion\u00a0caused 17 percent of pregnancy-related deaths. In modern times, just 0.2 percent of people who undergo abortions even require hospitalization for complications.\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what effect\u00a0Roe\u00a0had on public attitudes toward abortion because public opinion was already in flux before the case was decided. In 1965, just\u00a05 percent\u00a0of Americans thought abortion should be legal for married people who simply didn\u2019t want any more children. That number had risen to 36 percent by 1972, the year before\u00a0Roe\u00a0was decided. After\u00a0Roe\u00a0came down, pollsters began asking about abortion \u201cfor any reason,\u201d and the polls show\u00a0relative stability\u00a0in the responses to that question since the mid-1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law after Roe v. Wade\n\nLingering resistance to abortion, particularly strong in certain parts of the country, led legislatures to test the decision\u2019s boundaries. The Supreme Court issued many major abortion rulings up to the overturning of\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0in the 2022 case\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nIn\u00a0Planned Parenthood v. Danforth\u00a0(1976), the justices blocked a law requiring spousal consent for abortion.\nMaher v. Roe\u00a0(1979) permitted states to exclude abortion services from Medicaid coverage.\nColautti v. Franklin\u00a0(1979) struck down an unconstitutionally vague Pennsylvania law that required physicians to try to save the life of a fetus that might have been viable.\nIn\u00a0Harris v. McRae\u00a0(1980), the Court upheld the\u00a0Hyde Amendment, a federal law that proscribed federal funding for abortions except when necessary to preserve life or as a result of rape or incest.\nIn\u00a0L. v. Matheson\u00a0(1981), the Court upheld a law requiring parental notification when the patient is a minor living with parents.\nIn\u00a0City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health\u00a0(1983), the justices invalidated a wide range of limitations on abortion, such as a waiting period, parental consent without judicial bypass, and a ban on abortions outside of hospitals after the first trimester.\nThornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u00a0(1986) struck down a law that required informed consent to include information about fetal development and alternatives to abortion.\nIn\u00a0Webster v. Reproductive Health Services\u00a0(1989), Justice Rehnquist upheld rules requiring doctors to test for viability after 20 weeks and blocking state funding and state employee participation in abortion services.\nRust v. Sullivan\u00a0(1991) upheld a ban on certain federal funds being used for abortion referrals or counseling.\nHill v. Colorado\u00a0(2000) upheld a law limiting protest and leafletting close to an abortion clinic.\nStenberg v. Carhart\u00a0(2000) struck down Nebraska\u2019s ban on the\u00a0dilation and extraction\u00a0abortion procedure.\nIn\u00a0Gonzales v. Carhart\u00a0(2007), a slightly changed Court upheld a federal ban on the dilation and extraction procedure.\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey\u00a0(1992)\nOne case in the period between\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0deserves special attention. Through the 1980s, abortion opponents demanded the appointment of Supreme Court justices who would overturn\u00a0Roe. With the confirmation of Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, and David Souter, anti-abortion activists were confident they had the votes.\nIn 1988 and 1989, the Pennsylvania legislature adopted new abortion restrictions, including parental consent requirements, spousal notification, a waiting period, and an expanded informed consent process. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania challenged the law, and many viewed the case as\u00a0Roe\u2019s last stand \u2014\u00a0an opportunity for the Court to do away with the constitutional right to abortion.\nIn\u00a0Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, however, the new members of the Court disappointed anti-abortion advocates. While the Court replaced\u00a0Roe\u2019s trimester-by-trimester doctrine with a weaker level of protection and upheld elements of the Pennsylvania law that did not unduly burden the right to abortion, the justices declined to overrule\u00a0Roe. A plurality opinion authored by O\u2019Connor, Kennedy, and Souter explained that, while Supreme Court precedents are not eternal, there must be a compelling reason to abandon\u00a0stare decisis\u00a0\u2014 the notion that precedents should be upheld. The Court decided there was no adequate justification for overturning\u00a0Roe, especially since Americans had arranged their lives around an expectation of control over their reproductive health, including having access to abortion.\u00a0Casey\u00a0also acknowledged the strong equality concerns that justify abortion rights, arguing that women cannot participate fully in the social and economic life of the nation if they are forced to continue unwanted pregnancies.\u00a0\nDobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0(2022)\nIn 2018, the Mississippi legislature\u00a0banned abortions\u00a0after 15 weeks of gestation, except in cases of narrowly defined medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. The law was a challenge to both\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey. Jackson Woman\u2019s Health Organization, the sole abortion provider in the state, contested the ban.\nLong before\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0was decided, signs pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s intention to rescind the constitutional right to abortion. First, in a separate case that first appeared on the Court\u2019s\u00a0shadow docket, the justices\u00a0allowed a Texas abortion ban\u00a0that contravened\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0to remain in force. Then, in the weeks before\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0came down, a draft decision overturning\u00a0Roe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0leaked out of the Court in an unprecedented breach of Court protocol.\u00a0\nThe final\u00a0decision\u00a0was little changed from the leaked draft. Writing for the five-justice majority (with Chief Justice Roberts concurring only in the judgment), Justice Samuel Alito argued that the right to privacy is not specifically guaranteed anywhere in the Constitution. When unenumerated liberty rights exist \u2014\u00a0the right to raise your child as you see fit, for example \u2014\u00a0those rights must be \u201cdeeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d Reviewing the history of abortion restrictions in the early United States, Alito concluded that the right to abortion is not.\nThe opinion ignited a firestorm of controversy. Predictably so:\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0is arguably the first case to formally rescind a fundamental constitutional right. The opinion also\u00a0failed to explain\u00a0how its logic would not also result in the overturning of\u00a0Griswold\u2019s right to contraception or a series of other cases that rely on the same logic as\u00a0Roe. These include\u00a0Lawrence v. Texas\u00a0(2003), which invalidated laws criminalizing same-sex intimate sexual conduct, and\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges\u00a0(2015), which recognized the right to marriage for same-sex couples.\u00a0\nAlso, for many Americans, Alito\u2019s insistence that rights be \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in U.S. history revealed a broad discounting of historically marginalized communities, including women, people of color, and gay Americans. The only rights \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in our history are the ones that served the white, heterosexual men who dominated government at the time of the founding. While\u00a0Casey\u00a0had begun to address the equality dimensions of abortion rights,\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0moved in precisely the opposite direction, suggesting that non-majority groups must overcome special hurdles to have their rights recognized.\nAbortion rights will now be defined on a state-by-state basis. Several state courts have ruled that their constitutions\u00a0guarantee the right to abortion, whether because of explicit references to \u201cprivacy\u201d or by relying on language that broadly protects personal autonomy. The\u00a0Kansas Supreme Court, for example, has ruled that the constitution\u2019s guarantee of \u201cequal and inalienable natural rights\u201d protects personal decision-making, self-determination, and bodily integrity. Other states have adopted an approach consistent with\u00a0Roe, in which the right to privacy, including reproductive freedom, has been recognized as implied in the state constitution.\nFollowing the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0case, anti-abortion activists have proposed state constitutional amendments stating that nothing in the constitution protects\u00a0abortion rights. In some cases, these measures seek to overrule their state courts\u2019 interpretations of the constitution. In others, there has been no court decision regarding the constitutional right to abortion. Other states have, in contrast, moved to expand or cement abortion rights, including through constitutional amendments.\nDobbs\u00a0also leaves a long list of unanswered practical questions. Can states ban women from traveling to obtain an abortion? How will they police the importation and use of abortion drugs? How will state courts handle the slew of \u201ctrigger laws\u201d \u2014 state anti-abortion statutes designed to come into effect upon the overturning of\u00a0Roe? Just as\u00a0Roe\u00a0set off years of legal uncertainty over the precise boundaries of abortion rights,\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0has launched a long period of uncertainty over states\u2019 power to restrict abortion in the absence of those rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court justices\u2019 abortion views\n\nThe current Court\nChief Justice John\u00a0Roberts, during his time as a lawyer for the George W. Bush administration, wrote that\u00a0Roe\u00a0has \u201cno support\u00a0in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution.\u201d In his\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0concurrence, however, Roberts favored preserving a more limited constitutional right to abortion, without specifying how far it would extend. \u201cSurely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of\u00a0stare decisis.\u201d\nJustice Clarence Thomas, who was in the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0majority, has written that\u00a0Roe\u00a0was \u201cgrievously wrong for many reasons, but the most fundamental is that its core holding \u2014 that the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to abort her unborn child \u2014\u00a0finds no support\u00a0in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\nJustice Samuel Alito\u00a0complained as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration about \u201cthe courts\u2019 refusal to\u00a0allow breathing room\u00a0for reasonable state regulation\u201d of abortion. In a job application, he wrote, \u201cI\u00a0personally believe very strongly that the Constitution\u00a0does not protect\u00a0a right to an abortion.\u201d As the authority of the majority opinion in\u00a0Dobbs, he wrote that \u201cRoe\u00a0was . . . egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided.\u201d\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, who was in the\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0majority, has said and written less on abortion than many other justices, but during his confirmation hearing, he noted that\u00a0Roe\u00a0was \u201ca precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court\u201d and added, \u201conce a case is settled, that\u00a0adds to the determinacy\u00a0of the law.\u201d\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0added her name to a 2006 ad\u00a0calling for\u00a0Roe\u00a0to be overturned\u00a0and suggested that the possibility of adoption might\u00a0obviate the need for abortion rights.\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, in 2017, proclaimed his admiration of former justice Rehnquist\u2019s\u00a0Roe\u00a0dissent, noting that his views about unenumerated rights were \u201csuccessful in\u00a0stemming the general tide\u00a0of freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights that were not rooted in the nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u00a0repeatedly described\u00a0Roe\u00a0as \u201csettled law\u201d in her confirmation hearings. In the same hearings, when asked when human life begins, she replied simply, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor\u00a0has focused much of her writing about\u00a0abortion on the cost that bans impose on those who are economically disadvantaged. Objecting to the Court\u2019s decision to allow a Texas abortion ban to stand, Sotomayor wrote, \u201cThose without the ability to make this journey [to a state allowing abortion], whether due to lack of money or childcare or employment flexibility or the myriad other constraints that shape people\u2019s day-to-day lives, may be forced to carry to term against their wishes or\u00a0resort to dangerous methods of self-help.\u201d The\u00a0Dobbs\u00a0dissent, authored by Justice Breyer and joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, continued that theme of disempowerment, lamenting the end of an era in which \u201crespecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions.\u201d\nJustice Elena Kagan\u00a0has a significant and slightly complicated record on abortion. As a lawyer in the Clinton administration, she wrote a\u00a0memo recommending\u00a0that the president sign a ban on \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d if it contained an exception in cases of serious risk to health. As a justice, however, Kagan has voted consistently against restrictions on abortion. She called a recent Texas abortion ban \u201cpatently unconstitutional\u201d and dissented forcefully in\u00a0Dobbs.\u00a0\nNotable past justices\nJustice Stephen Breyer: \u201cMillions of Americans\u00a0believe that life begins at conception\u00a0and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child . . .\u00a0Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.\u201d\nChief Justice Warren Burger: \u201cThe Constitution\u00a0does not compel a state to fine-tune its statutes\u00a0so as to encourage or facilitate abortions. To the contrary, state action \u2018encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances\u2019 is \u2018rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life.\u2019\u201d\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: \u201cRoe v. Wade\u00a0sparked public opposition and academic criticism, in part, I believe, because the Court\u00a0ventured too far in the change it ordered\u00a0and presented an incomplete justification for its action.\u201d\nJustice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor: \u201cThe\u00a0Roe\u00a0framework . . . is\u00a0clearly on a collision course\u00a0with itself.\u201d\nChief Justice William Rehnquist: \u201cWe do not see why the state\u2019s interest in protecting human life should\u00a0come into existence only at the point of viability.\u201d\nJustice Antonin Scalia: \u201cWe should get out of this area [abortion law], where we have no right to be, and where we\u00a0do neither ourselves nor the country\u00a0any good by remaining.\u201d\nJustice Byron White: \u201cThe Court apparently\u00a0values the convenience of the pregnant mother\u00a0more than the continued existence of the life or potential life that she carries.\u201d\nJustice William J. Brennan Jr.: \u201cIf the right to privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be\u00a0free from unwanted government intrusion\u00a0into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision to bear or beget a child.\u201d\nJustice Anthony Kennedy: \u201cWhere it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may\u00a0use its regulatory power\u00a0to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.\u201d\nJustice David Souter: \u201cI have not got any agenda on\u00a0what should be done with\u00a0Roe v. Wade, if that case is brought before me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              More from the Explainers collection\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplainer\nGovernment Classification and the Mar-a-Lago Documents\nUnderstanding how the classification system works is critical to understanding Trump\u2019s culpability \u2014 legal and otherwise.\n\n\nElizabeth Goitein\n\n October 6, 2022\n\n\nRead More about Government Classification and the Mar-a-Lago Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplainer\nWhat Gifts Must Supreme Court Justices Disclose?\nThere are significant loopholes in the rules that apply to the high court.\n\n\nJennifer Ahearn, Beatrice Frum\n                          \n August 11, 2023\n\n\nRead More about What Gifts Must Supreme Court Justices Disclose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplainer\nMyths and Realities: Understanding Recent Trends in Violent Crime\nThe recent rise in crime is extraordinarily complex.
