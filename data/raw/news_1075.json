She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n      \n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of Friday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, Republicans made clear that their ambitions don\u2019t stop there: Some are already lining up to support a nationwide abortion ban if they recapture control of Congress in November\u2019s midterm elections. \nFormer Vice President Mike Pence tweeted Friday that Republicans \u201cmust not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land.\u201d \nHouse Republican leaders \u2014 including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican Study Committee chair Jim Banks, and Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan \u2014 also said that they would back a nationwide ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN reported. \n\u201cIn the days and weeks following this decision, we must work to continue to reject extreme policies that seek to allow late-term abortions and taxpayer dollars to fund these elective procedures,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement Friday. \u201cAs we celebrate today\u2019s decision, we recognize the decades of advocacy from the pro-life movement and we acknowledge much work remains to protect the most vulnerable among us.\u201d\nThe repeal of Roe v. Wade left the United States with a patchwork of state laws governing abortion. In parts of the South, someone seeking an abortion would need to travel hundreds of miles to get one. But a national ban would supersede even permissive state laws in states that have been working to expand access to abortion. One estimate found that denying all wanted abortions would increase pregnancy-related deaths by 21 percent nationwide if there aren\u2019t effective means for pregnant people to self-manage their abortions. \nA national ban has been a longstanding goal of anti-abortion advocates, who have for months been trying to plot out a strategy to rally Republicans around the issue in this year\u2019s midterm elections and push 2024 GOP presidential candidates to endorse the policy. The Supreme Court has now put that goal potentially within reach. \nBut it\u2019s not clear how politically feasible a nationwide ban is. Embracing such a broadly unpopular policy could carry electoral costs for Republicans by further activating Democratic voters. And the party would need to consolidate power in Congress and the White House to actually make it law. \nThe political obstacles to enacting a nationwide ban\nRepublicans are widely expected to recapture the majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, meaning a ban could pass. But it probably wouldn\u2019t win support from a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, even if the GOP regains control of the chamber as projected, though Republicans could choose to eliminate the filibuster to pass the ban. \nA Democrat in the White House would veto any such legislation. But there\u2019s no such guarantee after 2024, especially given that most Americans don\u2019t want President Joe Biden to seek reelection. \nStill, it\u2019s not clear that Republicans would have the votes. They have previously introduced bills that would recognize life from the moment of fertilization, effectively banning abortion nationwide. But only 19 senators and 164 House members have supported the legislation, far short of the numbers it would need to pass. \nA 15-week ban, as House Republican leadership have floated, might have better prospects. That\u2019s because the vast majority of abortions \u2014 about 93 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 already happen at or before 13 weeks of pregnancy, and Americans are generally less supportive of abortion further into pregnancy. But it\u2019s still an earlier cutoff than currently exists in most states where abortion is legal. \nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been cautious to entertain the idea publicly. After a draft version of the Supreme Court opinion was leaked to Politico in May, he said that a nationwide ban was \u201cpossible,\u201d but later backtracked, saying there wasn\u2019t a veto-proof majority in the Senate for abortion-related legislation of any kind. \nEmbracing a nationwide ban could ultimately backfire for Republicans, given that 85 percent of voters think abortion should be legal in some or all circumstances. This year, there are other factors at play, including inflation and an unpopular Democratic president, and the November elections are still months away \u2014 a long time for Democrats to sustain momentum around the issue. Still, the prospect of a ban could be a motivating factor for voters this fall.\n\u201cI definitely think it\u2019s a jolt for the Democrats, and that it\u2019s not really a jolt for Republicans. Republicans are already fired up and ready to show up to vote. So I don\u2019t think it helps Republicans at all,\u201d Jay Williams, a Georgia-based GOP strategist, told me when the draft opinion leaked. \nFormer President Donald Trump has also reportedly predicted that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision could ultimately hurt Republicans politically, especially among suburban women who helped propel him into office in 2016, suggesting that he would be skeptical of embracing a nationwide ban. \nBut abortion advocates have argued that those concerns may not stop Republican efforts, pointing to Texas lawmakers who didn\u2019t suffer any significant political backlash for passing a ban last year on abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, typically about six weeks into pregnancy. \n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
