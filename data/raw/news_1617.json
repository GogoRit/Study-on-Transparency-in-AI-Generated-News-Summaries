Lesko also introduced this legislation in the 116th and 117th Congresses.\n\u201cI am proud to introduce this important legislation to save the lives of unborn babies and protect them from the gruesome and violent practice of dismemberment abortion,\u201d said Congresswoman Lesko. \u201cIn the wake of the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and as we celebrate the U.S. Supreme Court overturning this terrible decision, we must continue to defend the right to life for the most defenseless among us, the unborn.\u201d\n\u201cBrutal dismemberment abortions on unborn children who have fully formed arms, legs, fingers and toes is cruel and shows the true extremism of our country\u2019s status quo on abortion policy,\u201d said the Honorable Marilyn Musgrave, Vice President of SBA Pro-Life America. \u201cWe thank Rep. Lesko and her colleagues in the House for introducing this compassionate bill and we look forward to continuing to work with members of Congress to pass legislation that protects unborn children and their mothers from the horror of abortion.\u201d\nThis bill prohibits a physician from knowingly performing a dismemberment abortion, a method used during the second and third trimesters when a baby can feel the pain of an abortion. This legislation allows a woman or a parent of a minor who undergoes a dismemberment abortion to file a civil action for damages against an individual who performs this procedure. Any physician who performs a dismemberment abortion is subject to a criminal fine, up to two years in prison, or both, unless the procedure was necessary to save the mother's life. This legislation also bars a woman who undergoes a dismemberment abortion from criminal prosecution.\nLesko was joined by Representatives Brian Babin (R-TX-36), Jim Baird (R-IN-04), Jim Banks (R-IN-03), Andy Biggs (R-AZ-05), Ben Cline (R-VA-06), Jeff Duncan (R-SC-03), Matt Gaetz (R-FL-01), Paul Gosar (R-AZ-09), Garret Graves (R-LA-06), Bill Johnson (R-OH-06), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL-13), Carol Miller (R-WV-01), Mary Miller (R-IL-15), Nathaniel Moran (R-TX-01), Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA-14), and William Timmons (R-SC-04) in introducing this legislation. This legislation is supported by SBA Pro-Life America.\n###\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink: https://lesko.house.gov/2023/2/lesko-reintroduces-legislation-to-save-unborn-babies-lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\nIn the News\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
