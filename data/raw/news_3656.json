Wade was overturned in  Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nPro-life advocates across the country understood the gravity of the Court\u2019s ruling: pro-life laws in a number of states completely protecting life would soon take effect, and the culmination of thousands if not millions of pro-life advocates\u2019 work over the span of several decades had secured victory in the highest court.\nBut they also understood that the fight for life was far from over. As Alexandra DeSanctis and Ryan T. Anderson  write at National Review, \u201cthe pro-life movement must work to make abortion not only illegal but also unthinkable.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s most recent  annual report, released Sept. 9, underscores that point.\nThroughout the 2020-2021 report, Planned Parenthood claims again and again that it is in the business of \u201chealth care\u201d\u2014\u201chealth care\u201d that included a record-breaking 383,460 abortions in 2020. Indeed, Planned Parenthood is upfront that it thinks that ending innocent human life is necessary and something to be proud of:  \u201cAbortion is essential health care that cannot wait for the end of a pandemic or the whims of politicians. \u2026 Planned Parenthood health centers are proud to provide abortion.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood boasts increased numbers of aborted babies and quietly includes that it provided 239,000 fewer health services like well-woman exams and prenatal care than it did the previous year. Yet Planned Parenthood\u2019s revenue managed to increase from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.\nThe abortion organization\u2019s incessant talk of \u201chealth care\u201d is nothing more than a marketing ploy. National Review  notes  that \u201cin 20 years the number of abortions performed by Planned Parenthood affiliates has increased by an astounding 80 percent. During the same period, prenatal services offered by Planned Parenthood have declined by more than 43 percent.\u201d For every one prenatal service Planned Parenthood offers, it performs 41 abortions.\nElective abortion  continues to be its main focus  (as it has always been), no matter what euphemistic label Planned Parenthood tries to slap on it.\nReal health care does not leave patients with  increased risks for mental health problems, suicidal behaviors, and drug abuse. Real health care does not  end the life of a human being.\nPlanned Parenthood proudly provides over 40 percent of abortions in the U.S. every year\u2014and it won\u2019t be slowing down any time soon.\nWorse yet, Planned Parenthood is doing this deadly work while profiting off of taxpayers. In 2021, Planned Parenthood received $633.4 million in government reimbursements and grants\u2014a number that has steadily increased. And the Biden administration continues to do its best to make sure that Planned Parenthood receives massive amounts of  funding through Title X. With the federal government continuing to fuel this billion-dollar pro-abortion machine, it\u2019s crucial that those who believe that life is a human right keep working to save lives\u2014the lives of both mothers and their unborn babies.\nEvery single life is worth defending.  Keep praying with us and working with us to make abortion unthinkable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Caroline Reeves\n      \n\n        Copywriter\n      \n\n        Caroline Reeves serves as Copywriter at Alliance Defending Freedom\n      \n\n\n          View Profile \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
