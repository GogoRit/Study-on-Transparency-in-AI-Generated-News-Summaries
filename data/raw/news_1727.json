Subscribe to our daily newsletter.\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris tied the fight for legal abortion to fundamental freedoms, charging supporters to \u201cresolve to make history\u201d in a speech Sunday marking the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.\u00a0\u00a0\nHarris\u2019 remarks reflected how dramatically the landscape for abortion access and the politics surrounding it have changed since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade seven months ago. Her choice to speak in Florida \u2014 which is poised to further restrict abortion access this year \u2014 indicated a recognition on the part of the White House that abortion rights are now being decided not in Washington but in state capitals like Tallahassee.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica is a promise \u2014 a promise we must all make real in every statehouse, in every doctor\u2019s office, and yes, in every election,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to all the friends and leaders, I say, let us not be tired or discouraged, because we\u2019re on the right side together in the fight to protect the freedom and liberty of all people, of all women everywhere.\u201d\nHarris, in her remarks, linked the fight for abortion access to the basic principles underlying the United States\u2019 founding, invoking the words of the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem declaring the United States to be \u201cthe land of the free and the home of the brave.\u201d\n\u201cCan we truly be free if families cannot make intimate decisions about the course of their own lives?\u201d she said. \u201cCan we truly be free if so-called leaders claim to be, and I quote, on the vanguard of freedom while they dare restrict the rights of the American people and attack the very foundations of freedom?\u201d\nThe phrase invoked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who is seen as a likely 2024 presidential candidate and who signed a 15-week ban into law in 2022.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More abortion coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    50 years since Roe. Seven months since Dobbs.\n                \n\n\n\n                    The first post-Roe March for Life showed anti-abortion activists are far from done\n                \n\n\n\n                    States with abortion bans are also \u2018economically disempowering\u2019 people, report says\n                \n\n\n\n\nHarris also addressed what the administration is doing to increase access to medication abortion, a major front in the fight over abortion access. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) this month issued new guidance allowing retail pharmacies to dispense medication abortion for the first time. The move that drew a swift rebuke from officials in Florida, in particular \u2014 but Harris vowed the administration is \u201cfighting back.\u201d\nShe told the crowd that President Joe Biden issued a presidential memorandum Sunday directing the Department of Health and Human Services to work toward providing greater access to medication abortion and protecting patient privacy. The administration has previously pointed to both areas as ones they can influence, but the new memorandum directs agencies to \u201cconsider new guidance to support patients, providers, and pharmacies.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cMembers of our Cabinet and our administration are now directed to identify barriers to access to prescription medication and recommend actions to make sure that doctors can legally prescribe, that pharmacies can dispense, and that women can secure safe and effective medication,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nHarris again reiterated the administration\u2019s calls for Congress to pass legislation restoring nationwide abortion protections, which failed to pass the U.S. Senate in the last session of Congress, and slammed congressional Republicans pushing for a nationwide abortion ban.\n\u201cThe right of every woman in every state in this country to make decisions about her own body is on the line,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said it before and I will say it again: how dare they?\u201d\nBut, with Congress divided and unlikely to pass any substantive abortion legislation, Harris is using her office to draw the public\u2019s attention to state-level efforts to further restrict abortion \u2014 and support the lawmakers and advocates fighting them.\u00a0\nHarris has publicly spearheaded the Biden administration\u2019s response to the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade since the draft of the decision leaked in May 2022, giving her an elevated profile to lead on an issue that galvanized voters in the midterm elections. The midterms also gave Democrats a larger majority in the Senate, freeing up Harris from needing to break ties in that chamber and giving her greater flexibility to travel the country and advocate for abortion rights.\u00a0\nHer choice to speak in Tallahassee held multiple layers of significance. Florida is likely to further curtail abortion access in its 2023 legislative session, and DeSantis is one of the White House\u2019s highest-profile political foes.\nHarris decried \u201cextremist\u201d lawmakers in Florida for the state\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d 15-week abortion ban, which does not have exceptions for rape or incest.\u00a0\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, in Tallahassee, Florida, on January 22, 2023. \n (Don Vonmoore/AFP/Getty Images)\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s action has meant that many dedicated doctors and nurses now lose their ability to care for their patients,\u201d she told the crowd of about 1,500, many of them wearing hot pink Planned Parenthood shirts. \u201cThat providers risk going to jail just for doing their job. And that patients are denied critical care, and even fear that they will be punished simply for seeking care.\u201d\nFlorida is also a critical access point for abortion. Patients from Latin American and Caribbean nations where abortion is banned have long sought abortions in Florida. And most Southern states now ban or heavily restrict abortion, making Florida a crucial lifeline for patients within the United States.\u00a0\n\u201cSince the Dobbs decision, my colleagues and I have felt heartache over and over again as we must tell patients that we can\u2019t give them the care we are trained and qualified to provide,\u201d said Dr. Sujatha Prabhakaran, a Florida Planned Parenthood provider who introduced Harris at the event.\nLaura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, told The 19th that the number of abortion patients from other states coming to Planned Parenthood health centers in Florida has quadrupled since Roe was overturned, with its clinics in Tallahassee and Jacksonville absorbing most of the influx of out-of-state patients.\nMany come from Georgia, where abortion is banned after about six weeks, but some travel from as far as Texas, she said, increasing the demands on providers and caseworkers who assist patients with travel, lodging and child care. Goodhue said the 15-week limit and surge in patient demands means that Planned Parenthood clinics are \u201ctriaging\u201d to ensure patients can get care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much case management that we\u2019ve never had to do in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cThe falling of Roe v. Wade has made a huge impact on patients and health centers in the area.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n                          Previous Kamala Harris coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \u2018Fight we must\u2019: Kamala Harris works to rally young voters of color over abortion, democracy\n                \n\n\n\n                    Vice President Kamala Harris talks abortion, voting rights in midterm-focused Florida trip\n                \n\n\n\n                    How \u2014 and where \u2014 Kamala Harris is talking about abortion ahead of the midterms\n                \n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion advocates are now lobbying Florida Republicans, who won a supermajority in the state legislature in the 2022 midterms, to go even further, banning abortion totally or at six weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who recently told reporters that her organization would be \u201cambitious\u201d in pushing for more state-level state abortion restrictions, slammed Biden and Harris as \u201cout of touch\u201d on abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cVice President Harris could not have set up a starker contrast between the radical abortion lobby and the compassion and common sense of the American people,\u201d she said in a statement ahead of Harris\u2019 speech.\u00a0\nAndrew Shirvell, founder of Tallahassee-based Florida Voice for the Unborn, is among those criticizing the state\u2019s Republican leaders for not passing a total abortion ban. He told the Miami Herald that DeSantis \u201cshould be embarrassed\u201d by Harris coming to his backyard to \u201crally the troops.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a crisis situation,\u201d Shirvell told the Herald. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for our pro-life governor and our pro-life legislature to be totally indifferent to it. I mean, they seem to be talking more about saving gas stoves than they do all the unborn children.\u201d\nFlorida legislative leaders in both chambers have expressed support for further abortion limits, though it\u2019s unclear what restrictions would garner enough support to pass. DeSantis, for his part, told reporters in December he\u2019s \u201cwilling to sign great life legislation\u201d when asked if he would lead efforts to pass a six-week ban.\nA July 2022 survey from the University of South Florida and Florida International University found that a majority of Floridians polled opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. While 44 percent supported some restrictions on abortion, only 9 percent supported a total abortion ban.\u00a0\nThe Biden administration, with limited tools at its disposal, has taken actions to protect emergency medical treatment in pregnancy, expand access to contraception and federally funded family planning services, safeguard patient privacy and provide accurate information about abortion.\u00a0\nHarris\u2019s speech showed how the Biden administration\u2019s most powerful tool may be the bully pulpit. She ended her remarks with a call to action for the crowd, drawing resounding applause.\u00a0\n\u201cHere now, on this 50th anniversary, let us resolve to make history and secure this right for all Americans \u2014 and to remember when we fight, we win,\u201d she said.\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights leaders set focus on access, medication \u2014 and the long fight ahead\n\n\n\n\nReproductive rights emphasized in State of the Union address\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, states are poised to tighten abortion restrictions\n\n\n\n\nBiden calls out abortion by name and skewers \u2018extreme\u2019 bans in State of the Union address\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
