You could know that about Dr. Matt Harrison, including numerous patient\u2019s choice awards and compassionate doctor recognition, just to name a few, but it wouldn\u2019t show you his heart.\nPerhaps a recent photo of Harrison kneeling in prayer on a sidewalk in front of an abortion center captures him best. Or the comment left by one patient, \u201cYou won\u2019t find a more pro-life doctor. He truly has a vested interest in your health.\u201d\u00a0\n\nVicky Kaseorg\n\n\u00a0\nIf you are searching for a family doctor, there may not be a more important qualification than pro-life. Harrison values life so deeply, his patients can feel it and it\u2019s not hard to see why.\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nHarrison is a hospitalist with 22 years\u2019 experience in family medicine, serving five hospitals in the Charlotte, NC, area: Novant Health Salisbury Medical, Mint Hill Medical Center, Brunswick Medical Center, Matthews Medical Center and Thomasville Medical Center.\u00a0\nThis is just the preamble to his areas of service. In addition, Harrison gives of his time to run a clinic for prenatal care for uninsured women. HELP Pregnancy Center in Monroe, NC, is about an hour from his home.\u00a0\nHarrison is also the medical director of the student health clinic at Belmont Abby College. And he is also a medical advisor for Priests for Life and the Abortion Pill Rescue\u00ae Network.\nFor a week each year, Harrison runs clinics in Ghana and Vietnam. He has also been on mission trips in Mexico.\u00a0\n\nHarrison and his wife have seven children.\u00a0\n\u201cMy wife is my biggest hero,\u201d he stated regarding her backing of his work. \u201cShe helps and supports me in all this stuff. I couldn\u2019t do any of this stuff without my wife. She is a spiritual rock and prayer warrior in our family.\u201d\nPraying to save lives from abortion is a family affair, as the Harrison family regularly prays in front of three different abortion clinics in Charlotte. This started 20 years ago.\u00a0\nIn 2001 Dr. Harrison had begun a friendship with Flip Benham, who is a street preacher and pro-life advocate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The Harrison family- Left to right--Top row, Matthew, Kathleen, Rachel; \u00a0second row, John, Mabel, Michelle; third row, Paul, Dr. Harrison; \u00a0Front row, Joseph, Stephen (Michelle\u2019s husband) and dog Bandit.\n\nBenham challenged Harrison to step up what he was doing in pro-life work.\u00a0\nSo, Harrison started praying at the abortion clinics, offering help to women, talking with the escorts and the security teams outside the facilities. Two of the Harrison sons (Matthew and John) are seminary students, and they have often brought friends along to pray at the clinics.\nThe day of the event captured in the photo of Harrison was much like many of the other times he had prayed there. Supporters from the abortion facility came over and began filming Harrison. They were taunting him and saying he should be sued.\u00a0\nPro-life advocate Vicky Kaseorg witnessed the exchange and was appalled by the mocking of Harrison.\u00a0\nShe noted Harrison\u2019s work with Abortion Pill Rescue (APR) in a Facebook post:\n\u201cI have seen some of the many babies who were saved because of that life-saving intervention. I call him whenever I have a conflicted mom wavering between abortion or choosing life with medical concerns and he always picks up and always speaks to those women for free.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cI have seen some of the many babies who were saved because of that life-saving intervention.\" (Abortion Pill Rescue\u00ae)\nHarrison tried to engage in a conversation with the pro-abortion advocates. Because they were bringing up APR, he started to tell them about Dr. Mitchell Creinin\u2019s flawed study of the abortion pill reversal.\nThe abortion pill reversal protocol involves prescribing progesterone, the natural hormone in a woman\u2019s body that sustains a pregnancy, to counteract the effects of the first of two drugs in the chemical abortion regimen. Progesterone has been similarly used to treat women at risk of miscarriage for decades.\nCreinin is an abortion provider and paid consultant for Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of mifepristone, the first chemical abortion drug.\u00a0\nHe and other abortion advocates authored a study purportedly examining the effectiveness of APR, but the study was halted after some participants \u2013 who were given the first abortion pill \u2013 experienced \u201csevere hemorrhage requiring ambulance transport to hospital,\u201d and one losing enough blood to require a transfusion.\u00a0\nWhile the side effects experienced by women in the study are commonly known risks of the abortion pill, and the Creinin study was incomplete, it was widely misrepresented to disparage APR.\nIn an interview this past fall with Pregnancy Help News, Dr. Catherine Stark explained the significance of Creinin\u2019s study.\u00a0\n\u201cIt showed that progesterone was working to reverse the effects of RU-486 so they stopped the research saying it (the research) is too risky,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will not acknowledge that the abortion pill is the problem.\u201d\nAs with the bias of the Creinin research team, Harrison\u2019s opponents outside the abortion center that day were not open to any viewpoint contrary to their own. He tried to explain about the faulty study, but they were too riled up to talk, so he decided to just kneel and pray.\u00a0\nKaseorg, who took the photo, stated, \u201cAs they taunted and spewed their nasty, slanderous remarks, he said not a word but kneeled on the sidewalk and prayed. Later he told me he was praying for them.\u201d\nHarrison found the taunting to be very distracting as he was trying to pray.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 Dr. Matt Harrison\n\nHe said, \u201cThe devil knows my weakest point is pride, so my best response is getting on my knees. I can tell they are very scarred individuals with very deep wounds, and I pray they will not propagate the violence against mothers and their babies.\u201d\u00a0\nPrayer has been an effective weapon for Harrison especially in the battle for saving children from abortion.\u00a0\nIn 2006 a 20-year-old woman, named Ashley entered Harrison\u2019s office and asked if he could stop the effects of the abortion pill. The first thing he did was pray.\nHarrison searched through his medical books and decided on using progesterone injections to counter mifepristone which Ashley had taken 36 hours earlier. He hoped the progesterone would act as it has in the case of maintaining pregnancies at risk for miscarriage for over 50 years.\nAshley delivered a healthy baby girl, named Kaylie, in 2007. That first APR baby is now thirteen. This opened a door to what has become more than 1,000 babies saved through APR protocols.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 Ashley with Kaylie/KD Photography\n\nHarrison\u2019s work was made known to Dr. George Delgado in California, who had also begun utilizing the same protocol to disrupt the abortion process.\u00a0\nDelgado was in the midst of writing the 2012 Delgado and Davenport article published in The Annals of Pharmacotherapy when he reached out to Harrison in 2011. Delgado\u2019s desire to include Harrison\u2019s data in the study prompted the call. This was the beginning of Delgado and Harrison\u2019s association.\nIn 2013 the doctors joined in a press conference in Washington, D.C. announcing the introduction of a \u201ckit\u201d for doctors\u2019 offices containing the protocols for APR. The Abortion Pill Rescue\u00ae Network (APRN), which now includes approximately 900 providers, was founded by the two doctors.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Dr. George Delgado, Priests for Life's Father Frank Pavone, \u00a0 Harrison and Dr. Mary Davenport at the APR kit introduction\n\nOn April 12, 2018, the APRN 24-7 helpline and administration of the provider group was turned over to Heartbeat International. Both doctors remain as medical advisors for this effort.\nIn a 2015 interview with Charlotte's local Fox\u00a0affiliate\u00a0about APR, Harrison said that while he identifies as a pro-life doctor, he feels that what he\u2019s doing with APR is giving women a choice.\n\u201cI see it empowering these women,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cWe need to be ready for the women who feel they\u2019ve made a mistake, who say, \u2018what have I done, I want to help save that baby.\u2019 We need to be ready within an hour\u2019s notice to get them the medication they need to reverse the process.\u201d\nEditor's note: Heartbeat International manages the Abortion Pill Rescue Network and Pregnancy Help News. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nabortion pill\nabortion pill reversal\nAbortion Pill Rescue\u00ae\nAbortion Pill Rescue Network\nAPR\nmife\nMatt Harrison\nGeorge Delgado\nMitchell Creinin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Hayes\n\nKim Hayes is a writer for Pregnancy Help News.\u00a0She has been a teacher, author, speaker and facilitator for marriage and family issues and married for over 35 years to Jeff, with four grown children.\u00a0Kim\u2019s counseling experience included 21 years as a volunteer consultant and trainer at Pregnancy Decision Health Centers.\u00a0She was the Athletic Director of Columbus Crusaders Youth Sports ministry for 15 years.\u00a0Kim has written several books, including the latest release, Prodigal Rewind:\u00a0 The Grateful Son. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\n\n\nFirst OTC birth control hits U.S. market\n\n\n\nPregnancy medical clinic brings Abortion Pill Reversal and more to northern Arizona\n\n\n\nSarah\u2019s story of Abortion Pill Reversal\n\n\n\nTexas woman chooses APR after out-of-state abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\tback to top\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET OUR NEWS DIGEST \n\n\nGet Pregnancy Help News delivered to your inbox each Monday morning.\nEmail \nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal court banishes Idaho satanists\u2019 abortion lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDobbs as D-Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court to hear first abortion case since Dobbs on March 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\u2019s March for Life events from coast to coast: \u2018Proclaiming the gift of human dignity\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSCLogin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n                                Remember me                            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nNewsCommentaryVideoAbout\n\n\n\nGet Involved\nAdvertisement Information Contact Us Pitch a Story Write for Us!Partner with Us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Pregnancy Help News .
