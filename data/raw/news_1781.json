(Photo by Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law on Friday one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive bans on abortion, a Polk County judge heard arguments as to why he should block that law\u2019s enforcement.\nFor 75 minutes, Polk County District Judge Joseph Seidlin heard arguments from the state and from abortion-rights advocates telling the parties he would not be immediately ruling from the bench on a request to issue a temporary injunction blocking the law\u2019s enforcement. Seidlin said the importance of the issue demands that he give the matter more thought.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that would be more insulting to either side for a judge \u2014 who, before Wednesday at 11 o\u2019clock, had no idea that he was going to be involved in any of this \u2014 to listen to arguments and then rule from the bench \u2026 so flippantly without giving it any thought,\u201d he said.\nSeidlin indicated he hopes to issue a ruling late Monday or, perhaps, Tuesday.\nPlanned Parenthood: \u2018Iowans will suffer\u2019\nJust minutes before, Reynolds had signed into law House File 732, banning most abortions in Iowa after six weeks of gestation. The signing came three days after the bill was approved during an unusual special session of the Iowa Legislature. The bill took effect immediately upon Reynolds\u2019 signature at the Family Leader Summit at the Community Choice Credit Convention Center in downtown Des Moines.\nMeanwhile, less than one mile away, on the third floor of the Polk County Courthouse, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, the Emma Goldman Clinic and the ACLU of Iowa argued the law Reynolds was signing would put Iowa women at risk.\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s a abortion ban in place, people suffer,\u201d Peter Im, attorney for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America told Judge Seidlin. \u201cIf House File 732 takes effect, Iowans will suffer.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood and its co-plaintiffs had filed an emergency motion on Wednesday seeking a temporary injunction that would prevent the new law from being enforced, at least while litigation over the broader issue of the law\u2019s constitutionality was before the court.\nThe legislation is nearly identical to a 2018 law that the Iowa Supreme Court found unconstitutional and blocked from taking effect. It bans most abortions after embryonic cardiac activity can be detected through an ultrasound, which is usually around six weeks into a pregnancy. The bill contains narrow exceptions for rape and incest, or for procedures needed to save the patient\u2019s life.\nState: New law will \u2018prevent the destruction of human lives\u2019\nAt Friday\u2019s hearing, Im argued that at six weeks, many people do not yet know they are pregnant. Citing the fact that the law was written to take effect upon Reynolds\u2019 signature, he asked Seidlin for an immediate ruling from the bench.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 case is built on the grounds that the new law violates the Iowa Constitution because, in seeking to protect the unborn, it places an undue burden on prospective mothers and forces them to carry pregnancies to term.\n\u201cHouse File 732 unquestionably imposes an undue burden on those seeking an abortion in Iowa,\u201d Im told Judge Seidlin. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s unconstitutional \u2013 full stop.\u201d\nThe state is arguing Iowa\u2019s constitution doesn\u2019t guarantee a right to abortion and that decisions about the new law\u2019s legality should be based not on whether it places an \u201cundue burden\u201d on those seeking abortions but on whether the state has a \u201creasonable basis\u201d \u2013 such as protecting the lives of the unborn \u2013 for enacting such a law.\nDaniel Johnston, an attorney representing the state, told the court that while the plaintiffs had detailed numerous perceived harms to those seeking an abortion and to Iowans in general, any mention of the \u201cunborn life\u201d that is lost through abortion was \u201cconspicuously absent\u201d from their arguments.\n\u201cThe petitioners would have the court believe the only hardship here is to their patients and that\u2019s the only thing that weighs in the balance,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe fetal heartbeat bill,\u201d he said, using the term that\u2019s often used to describe the new law, \u201caims to prevent the destruction of human lives, and the court must take those lives into account.\u201d\nThe new law sprang from Reynolds\u2019 efforts this year to have the Iowa Supreme Court reconsider the original 2018 law in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. However, the Iowa court, split 3-3, kept the injunction in place, prompting Reynolds to call a special session to again pass what is essentially the same law.\nJustice Thomas Waterman, writing for the three justices on the prevailing side, concluded the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard for reviewing abortion laws remained in place, although he acknowledged that could change. The 2018 law remains unconstitutional under that standard, which means abortion laws cannot create excessive hurdles in procuring access to abortion without serving a legitimate public interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCourt decision on injunction that would block new abortion law could come Monday\nby Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch July 14, 2023\nCourt decision on injunction that would block new abortion law could come Monday\nby Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch July 14, 2023\n As Gov.
