Wade has collapsed,\u201d said Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut we want to make it clear that we are not going to support establishing abortion infrastructure on taxpayer-funded property in states that have rejected the inhumane destruction of preborn life. Uncle Sam should not be in the abortion business.\u201d\u00a0\nWASHINGTON D.C. (07-11-2022) \u2013\u00a0Nearly 40 Pro-Life and Pro-Family leaders joined together in a letter initiated by Students for Life Action calling on Congress to reject any efforts to place abortion vendor operations on taxpayer funded, federal property, an idea that has been widely\u00a0circulated by members\u00a0such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cOur legal analysis shows why any plan to misuse federal lands for abortion must be rejected,\u201d said Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins. \u201cThis is one of many bad ideas being circulated on Capitol Hill and in the media, which needs to be addressed. As the letter notes, \u2018Those committed to a radical agenda of abortion through all nine months, for any reason at all, and with taxpayer support will have to win support for that extremism in the ballot box rather than by creating a perverse kind of eminent domain.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLeaders signing on include those from: Students for Life Action, SBA Pro-Life America, March for Life Action, Eagle Forum, Catholic Vote, Concerned Women for America, Americans United for Life, Live Action, Dr. James Dobson Family Institute, Heroic Media, the Radiance Foundation, Human Life International, LifeNews.com, Mike Pence\u2019s Advancing American Freedom, Children First Foundation, Operation Outcry, Missouri Black for Life, National Prayer Luncheon, CEC for Life, Pro-Life Action Ministries,\u00a0American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, And Then There Were None, Human Life Alliance, Stanton Public Policy Center,\u00a0Life\u00a0Matters TV and Media, Inc,\u00a0The Justice Foundation,\u00a0The American Family Association,\u00a0Operation Rescue, Alliance Defending Freedom, Family Policy Alliance,\u00a0Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality/Lifewatch, Sidewalk Advocates, S.M.A.R.T.\u00a0Women\u2019s Healthcare, Secular Pro-Life, and Life Legal Defense Foundation. Other names to be added as they come in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cOn Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down their decision in\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health, which reversed\u00a0Roe v. Wade. The Court determined that there is not a right to an abortion under the Constitution of the United States. Thus, the decision on how and when to restrict or allow abortions is left to the American people through their elected representatives. Rather than respecting the rule of law as detailed in both our Constitution and in state law, many abortion radicals immediately began looking for ways to circumvent them and, by extension, the rights of pro-life citizens to protect life in law. The stated plans to force abortion into states where voters and their representatives have recognized the humanity of preborn children and passed laws to protect them represent both a coercive abuse of power and a proposed misuse of federal property. We the undersigned join together calling on members of Congress to prevent taxpayer funded properties from being perversely turned into abortion vendors.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo read the entire letter,\u00a0click here.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo read Hawkins\u2019 response to Biden\u2019s attempts to change the narrative with more abortion,\u00a0click here.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that President Biden and his team are prioritizing ending more lives with abortion. Death by abortion is one thing they know how to do. Biden\u2019s failure to help struggling Americans should lead him to re-evaluate his policies, not call for fewer Americans to be born.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action will also launch a nationwide petition drive,\u00a0especially significant in states whose laws could be broken, calling on their members of Congress to stop new federal efforts to bring abortion to their states.\u00a0Click here to read more.\u00a0\nFor interviews, contact Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\n\u201330\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages. Together they work to end abortion \u2014 the human rights issue of our day \u2014 and provide political, legal, and community support for women and their children, born and preborn.

SFLA and SFLAction\u00a0have more conversations with those most targeted by the abortion industry than any other pro-life outreach in the world, reaching more than 2 million people across social media platforms each week and engaging in approximately 100,000 digital conversations per month. Over the last 16 years, President Kristan Hawkins has grown SFLAction/SFLA into an $18 million organization preparing for a Post-Roe America.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,931\n\nShare this postKristi HamrickVice President of Media & Policy\nKristi Stone Hamrick, a well-known media consultant, strategist, writer, and commentator, is chief media strategist and spokesperson for Students for Life of America & Students for Life Action.BlogBlogrollUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
