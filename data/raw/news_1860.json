Tate Reeves signed into law a series of bills that he says create a culture of life. The legislation included tax credits for adoption and an expansion of Medicaid coverage for up to one year postpartum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n But critics say the bills aren't keeping up with the challenges.In the last year, the only NICU in the Delta closed, and at least three other labor and delivery units across the state have also shuttered.\n\n\n\"Obstetrics is a lot of times, you know, the first to go,\" said Dr. Rachel Morris.That inspired her to launch a program at the University of Mississippi Medical Center called Stork, where emergency workers are trained to deliver babies.\"Depending on the nature of their emergency, they may not have the luxury of getting in a car and driving two and a half hours,\" Morris said of some of the pregnant people in the area. \"It's gotta be so scary for these patients.\"She said the program helps to address a specific need in the area, where rural emergency rooms may not have some supplies for delivery. In addition to training, the program provides participating facilities with Stork bags, which contain critical supplies.\n\n\nMorris acknowledges there are still other issues of care to address in the region, but the program is \"a way to bridge the gap to give people what they need.\"\"For me, that's why I went into medicine, was to make a difference,\" she said.Morris said the program has trained 400 people and has a six-month waitlist.\n\n\nThe Battle Over Abortion\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas bill would make providers ask women why they're seeking abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlabama governor signs bill into law protecting IVF providers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance enshrines constitutional right to an abortion in a global first\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVS and Walgreens to start selling abortion pills this month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Republic blocks bill that would protect access to IVF nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Mississippi\nAbortion\n\nCaitlin Huey-Burns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n                Twitter\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst published on June 20, 2023 / 7:24 PM EDT\n\n\n\u00a9 2023 CBS Interactive Inc.
