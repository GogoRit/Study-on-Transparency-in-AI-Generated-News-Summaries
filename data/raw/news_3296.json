The attacks on these centers \u2013 which try to dissuade women from seeking abortions \u2013 are believed to be linked to Jane\u2019s Revenge, an extremist, militant pro-choice group.No one has been injured during these attacks, but the methods have been extreme: vandals have thrown molotov cocktails, committed arson, damaged property and made threats. At a time of rapidly increasing abortion restrictions in the US \u2013 and an upcoming supreme court decision this summer that is expected to result in total abortion bans in as many as 26 states \u2013 can more violence be expected?After the attack in Wisconsin, a letter signed by \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge\u201d was sent to a Bellingcat journalist laying out a kind of mission statement, and threatening further action. \u201cThis is not a mere \u2018difference of opinion\u2019 as some have framed it,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe are literally fighting for our lives. We will not sit still while we are killed and forced into servitude.\u201dThe letter also demanded that \u201canti-choice establishments\u201d \u2013 institutions that have a reputation for trying to lure women into unwanted pregnancies and spreading misinformation about the impacts of abortion \u2013 to disband within 30 days, or else face more violence.\u201cWisconsin is the first flashpoint,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut we are all over the US, and we will issue no further warnings \u2026 We will not stop until \u2026 the inalienable right to manage our own health is returned to us.\u201dMary Ziegler, a law professor at UC Davis with an expertise in the abortion movement, believes the attacks can be read as an expression of distrust in the government, and a loss of faith in democratic institutions.View image in fullscreenThe spray-painted message near Wisconsin Family Action\u2019s offices in Madison, Wisconsin. Photograph: Molly Beck/USA Today Network/Reuters\u201cA lot of people \u2013 conservatives and progressives \u2013 have lost faith in a lot of democratic institutions. A lot of people believe the supreme court is partisan and illegitimate,\u201d she said.She notes some of the public discourse around the supreme court in recent years: Donald Trump referred to supreme court justices as \u201cmy judges\u201d and was specific about the ways they would serve his aims. \u201cHe would just come out [and say] \u2018my\u2019 judges will give you specific outcomes on abortion, guns and a variety of other things,\u201d said Ziegler.The supreme court\u2019s impending rulings in a number of high-profile cases, from abortion to gun rights \u2013 in quick succession since Trump\u2019s appointments of justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2013 have only deepened the public\u2019s impression of partisanship, Ziegler said.\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s unfolding over a very long period of time. And [the supreme court] is rendering decisions that are all helping conservatives,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the court just does things that help conservatives, people will ask \u2018why is there a partisan body that isn\u2019t elected? Why is there a partisan body with lifetime appointments?\u2019\u201dWhat is surprising about these recent attacks, however, is that the vast majority of violent protest tactics \u2013 including around abortion \u2013 have come, historically, from the right of American politics. Rightwing protests over lockdown, racial justice and abortion have seen armed militias taking justice into their own hands, even storming the US Capitol. The tactics of the right on abortion have been similarly extreme: 11 people were murdered by anti-choice protesters between 1993 and 2016, and another 26 murders were attempted. The tactics of anti-abortion advocates have included bombings, arson, death threats and hate mail.Are violent protests successful?Ziegler believes that some people on both the left and the right might feel they are enacting some sort of vigilante justice when they resort to violent protest tactics around abortion. At present, pro-choice advocates may be seeing an apparent mismatch between public opinion and legislation: 61% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, yet states are enforcing increasingly extreme restrictions.These tactics, however, are not commonly successful, academics say \u2013 even if protesters feel their grievances are valid. Take the example of American civil rights protests in the 1950s and 1960s.Omar Wasow studied the political consequences of different kinds of protests during that period: violent and non-violent. He found violent protest seemed to have the unintended effect of chilling support for the movement, leading to more votes for conservatives, while peaceful protest apparently had the effect of liberalising white voters.\u201cEven if we think violence might be justified in response to state repression under segregation, or Jim Crow, it may produce outcomes entirely contrary to what activists were fighting for,\u201d said Wasow. \u201cNorm-violating tactics can be repulsive to put to potential moderate allies.\u201dZiegler said the same has been true for the anti-abortion movement, whose own violence has rarely been effective.\u201cI don\u2019t think that violence was particularly effective for conservatives,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong to say that progressives need to be willing to use the strategies that conservatives have used. But committing illegal acts of violence has not historically been why the anti-abortion movement has succeeded.\u201dInstead, she said, the movement has succeeded as well as it has due to big, long-term, structural changes: essentially changing the rules of the game. \u201cThey have gotten involved in changing the rules of campaign finance, they have changed access to the vote, and changed how the supreme court confirmation process works.\u201d\u201cPeople often focus on a narrow period of time and say, \u2018Oh, look at how all of this success was made [in a small period],\u2019 but there\u2019s really decades of activism that\u2019s slowly building the kind of social and political capital to make change happen,\u201d Wasow said.With popular opinion seemingly on the side of keeping abortion legal at least in some instances, such tactics could simply sully the aims of the cause, Ziegler warned.\u201cIf you have majority support for what you stand for, and the message you send is, \u2018Who cares, we\u2019re gonna go out and commit acts of violence,\u2019 that will probably also be counterproductive.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
