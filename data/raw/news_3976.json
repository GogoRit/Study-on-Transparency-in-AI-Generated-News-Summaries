CARMMA was launched on the 7th May 2009, during the 4th Session of the Conference of AU Ministers of Health (CAMH4) held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the campaign\u2019s slogan was: \u2018Africa Cares: No Woman Should Die while Giving Life\u2019.\nThe Assembly of Heads of State and Government (Assembly/AU/Decl.2(XXIII) and Assembly/AU/18(XXIII)Add.3 resolved to, \u2018\u2019achieve Universal access to quality Maternal, Newborn and Child Health services by strengthening the implementation of the Campaign for the Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA)\u2019\u2019. \nThe campaign utilizes policy dialogue, advocacy and community mobilization to harness political commitment of member states towards improving maternal, child and newborn health (MNCH) as well as the survival of mothers, their newborns and children across the continent. \nThe CARMMA campaign has been under the guidance and leadership of three successive Commissioners of Social Affairs, namely; H.E Bience Gawanas (2002 - 2012), H.E. Dr. Mustapha Sidiki Kaloko (2012-2016) and H.E. Amira Elfadil (2017 to present). CARMMA observed its 10th anniversary in 2019, and over the decade 51 member states (except for Egypt, Libya, Morocco and South Sudan) have launched the CARMMA campaign. The campaign, through advocacy, has championed the maternal health, sexual and reproductive rights of women. In addition, the campaign placed emphasis on the sexual reproduction of adolescents. The CARMMA platform also enabled the African Union Commission to spearhead and prioritize maternal, child and adolescents health issues on the political agenda of member states, which further influenced the global agenda on women and children\u2019s health.\nThe advocacy campaign had several successes that can be used to advance the maternal newborn and child health of Agenda 2063. It is globally recognized that fulfilling the rights of women and girls is central to development. The Commission as of 2012 ( Assembly/AU/Dec.494 (XXII)) produced status reports on maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH).The theme for the years reports; 2014, 2017 and 2019 were as follows; \u2019\u2019Status report on Maternal New born and Child Health: Challenges for Inclusive and Universal Access\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Status report On Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health: Focusing On Unfinished Business In Africa\u2019\u2019, and; \u2018\u2019Status report on the State of Health of the Mother, the Newborn, the Child and the Adolescent: Women and Children living in Humanitarian Crisis/Conflicts Contexts and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)\u2019\u2019 respectively. \nThe African Union Commission also convened its partners and stakeholders for the first International Conference on Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in Africa in August, 2013 in Johannesburg, South Africa under the theme; \u2018\u2019A Call to Action\u2019\u2019. It was acknowledged by the conference, progress made, and committed to reinforcing action on CARMMA. The key recommendation of the conference was to accelerate concrete actions for results delivery. The second action oriented international conference took place in 2018, in Nairobi, Kenya under the theme \u201cMaintaining momentum and focus towards ending preventable maternal and child deaths by 2030 \u2013 Sustainable path towards Africa\u2019s Transformation\u201d provided an opportunity to take stock of the progress made in addressing maternal, newborn and child health issues in Africa, a number of innovative solutions were recommended to address maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH). \nThe CARMMA Campaign has a website to its credit (https://www.carmma.org) launched in 2012 and upgraded in 2019. The website and Social media tools such as Facebook (CARMMAfrica) and Twitter @CARMMAfrica have served as a critical communication and advocacy tools in  promoting maternal and new-born survival strategies and providing evidence on the progress toward achieving the targets set by African leaders. \nOBJECTIVES OF CARMMA\nThe main objectives of the campaign were to;\na.\tExpand the availability and use of universally accessible quality health services, including those related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH), which are critical to reducing maternal mortality.\nb.\tSustain radical reappraisal of practices, programmes and policies in order to improve maternal and child health and well-being in Africa transitioning from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nc.\tUse policy dialogue, advocacy and community mobilization to secure political commitment, increase resources (particularly domestic financing and investment) and solicit societal and behavioral change in support of MNCH.\nCARMMA 10TH ANNIVERSARY AND WAYFORWARD \nTo mark the 10th anniversary of the CARMMA campaign an evaluation of the campaign was undertaken, the findings have provided recommendations that shall set the agenda for the next steps of the Campaign. The evaluation report is available online https://www.carmma.org, also at the Division of Health, Nutrition and Population of the Department of Social Affairs and the library of the African Union Commission, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. \nFurther information can be obtained from the Department of Social Affairs:\nDepartmentofSocialAffairs@africa-union.org and from; Dr. Margaret Agama-Anyetei, Head of Division for Health, Nutrition and Population; Social Affairs Department; AU Commission; Tel: +251115162211; E-mail: Agama-AnyeteiM@africa-union.org\nMedia inquiry Contacts:\nMs. Esther Azaa Tankou, Head of Information Division, Tel: +251911361185, E-mail: yamboue@yahoo.com\nFor further information contact\nDirectorate of Information and Communication | African Union Commission I E-mail: dic@africa-union.org I Web Site: www.au.int I Addis Ababa | Ethiopia\nFollow us\nFace book: https://www.facebook.com/AfricanUnionCommission\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_AfricanUnion\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/AUCommission\n \n\n\n\n\n38029-pr-carmma_article-branded.pdf\n\n Press release(En) \n\n \n\n\n\nLink:\u00a0 \n\n\n\nHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS) \n\n\n\nEthiopia \n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu: DP HHS\n\n\n\nHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS)\n\nHHS Home\nCore Functions\nLeadership\nNews & Events\nDocuments\nSpeeches\nContacts\n\n \n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n   \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment Resources\n\nKey DocumentsFactsheetsSpeechesAll Documents\n\n\n Documents \n Outbreak Brief #4: Cholera in African Union Member States  \n May 31, 2023 \n Outbreak Update: \u00a0As of 3 May 2023, a total of 765,222,932 COVID-19 cases and 6,921,614 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 1%) have been reported globally by 232 countries and territories to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n  \n\n Documents \n Outbreak Brief #3: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Date of Issue \n May 05, 2023 \n Outbreak Update: \u00a0As of 3 May 2023, a total of 765,222,932 COVID-19 cases and 6,921,614 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 1%) have been reported globally by 232 countries and territories to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n  \n\n Documents \n Outbreak Brief #2: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Date of Issue \n April 02, 2023 \n Outbreak Update: \u00a0As of 1 April 2023, a total of 761,402,282 COVID-19 cases and 6,887,000 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 1%) have been reported globally by 232 countries and territories to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n  \n\n Documents \n Outbreak Brief #1: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Date of Issue \n March 22, 2023 \n Outbreak Update: \u00a0As of 21 March 2023, a total of 760,360,956 COVID-19 cases and 6,873,477 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 1%) have been reported globally by 232 countries and territories to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n  \n\n\n\n\n Factsheets \n Diaspora Division factsheet \n September 19, 2020 \n The African Union Commission (AUC) envisions \u201can integrated continent that is politically united based on the ideals of Pan Africanism an  \n\n Factsheets \n Factsheet: Mobilizing Africa\u2019s Workforce for Development \n June 24, 2020 \n Background  \n\n Factsheets \n Factsheet: CIDO -
