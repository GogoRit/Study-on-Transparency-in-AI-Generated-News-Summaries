We are still disenfranchised,\u201d said Ethelyn Holden Baker, a retired Fayetteville teacher who has long been active in local issues, including voting rights. \u201cOur environment still shows discrimination against women and particularly women of color.\u201dOn Aug. 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment, ensuring its passage. On Aug. 26, the secretary of state proclaimed the amendment part of the Constitution.Photos: Historic photos of women's rights activistsAccording to a Sept. 20, 1920, article in the Fayetteville Observer, a Cumberland County woman, Mrs. A. Bert Breece, became the first female in the state to register to vote.\"Mrs. A. Bert Breece has registered and will vote in the special election that will be held in (Flea Hill) township on Sept. 28 for special school taxes,\" the article read.The passage followed decades of struggle. In 1848, the first women\u2019s rights convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, marking the beginning of the national women\u2019s rights movement.A day before Tennessee passed the measure, the North Carolina legislature failed to pass it. It wasn\u2019t until 1971 that North Carolina ratified the amendment.\u00a0Mississippi was the last state to do so, in 1984. By that time, it was a purely symbolic gesture.An Aug. 6, 1920, story in the Fayetteville Observer quoted a legislator predicting the measure's failure.\"I have taken a poll of the members and if all stick who have written me, I look for a majority against ratification in the House and a tie vote in the Senate,\" the article quoted Rep. B.G. Crisp as saying.Fayetteville historian Bruce Daws said that Fayetteville doesn\u2019t appear to have been a focus of the suffrage movement, although he said the city had\u00a0a \u201cstrong anti-suffrage sentiment.\"\u201cAs compared to other places, we didn\u2019t make the news too much here,\u201d Daws said.Daws said that even before suffrage, Fayetteville had a tradition of strong female leaders in business, education, the church and other areas.Daws said a group of women was instrumental in saving the downtown Market House and converting it into a library after it had been designated for destruction in the early 20th century.Shortly after the 19th Amendment\u2019s passage, Daws said, Katherine Robinson Everett of Fayetteville became the city\u2019s first woman lawyer and one of the first in the state. Everett died in 1992 at age 97 after a 70-year career.Daws said that in those days, some women married older men, then inherited and ran their businesses after their husbands died.\u201cWomen throughout Fayetteville history were involved in all sorts of things,\u201d Daws said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t relegated to the kitchen and having babies.\u201dThe 19th Amendment's passage brought speculation as to how the change would affect the political landscape. An Aug. 31, 1920, Fayetteville Observer article was headlined, \"Entrance of women into politics may drive out age old office holders.\" The story said \"both Republican and Democratic nominees for county offices in some sections of the state are going to be hard pressed in the November election.\"Patrick O\u2019Neil, a history professor at Methodist University, also said Fayetteville and surrounding areas don\u2019t appear to have been a center of suffrage activity.O\u2019Neil said that most of the pro-suffrage activity in North Carolina tended to be in the\u00a0 western part\u00a0of the state. That may have been because powerful people in areas with a bigger Black population, such as the eastern part of the state, believed that giving women the right to vote might lead to Black people also having more access to the ballot box.\u201cThe reason it was stronger out west is because the suffragettes had a hard time trying to get women to vote while still denying Black people the right to vote,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cThey understood that opening the vote to women might also open the vote to Black women. Generally, the larger the Black population, the less likely that powerful people were going to want women\u2019s suffrage.\u201dCiting the book \u201cGender and Jim Crow\u201d by Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, O\u2019Neil said the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 led to a high number of Black people attempting to get around the barriers that prevented them from voting, such as literacy tests.A May 25, 1920, Fayetteville Observer article noted the anti-suffrage sentiment. \"Anti-suffrage leaders reach Raleigh ready to wage fight against vote,\" read the headline on the article.Waddle moved to Fayetteville with her husband in 1972 from Ohio. Although it had been more than 50 years since the passage of the 19th Amendment, Waddle said she encountered a barrier when she registered to vote here.\u201cI had to read the preamble to the Constitution,\u201d Waddle said. \u201cI was so naive I didn\u2019t realize I was being given a literacy test.\u201dWaddle said the preamble had been printed out; she didn\u2019t have to recite it from memory.Waddle said while the 19th Amendment was a landmark, the battle for women\u2019s rights and voting rights did not end with its passage. She pointed to the long-stalled passage of the Equal Rights Amendment as an example.The Equal Rights Amendment, which would guarantee legal rights to all Americans regardless of gender, was introduced to Congress in 1923.Its text reads, in full, \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\u00a0The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\u00a0This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.\"The measure was reintroduced in 1971 and approved by the House and Senate. It was submitted to the states, with the approval of 38 states needed for passage.Facing opposition, the amendment did not get the required number of states by the 1982 deadline, although in recent years, enough states have approved it to push it to the 38-state mark. Still, the measure remains in legal limbo.\u201cWe are still working on getting that one ratified,\u201d Waddle said. \u201cAnd that has occupied a good portion of my time over the past several years and decades.\u201dBaker agrees that work remains to be done on voting rights. And she said that for Black people especially, the 19th Amendment was not a slam-dunk guarantee of voting rights.Baker, who gives her age as \u201cmid-octogenarian,\u201d said Black women like herself could not take voting rights for granted.\u201cAs Black women, women of color, Hispanics, we did not have the right to vote until (the Civil Rights Act) in 1965,\u201d Baker said. \u201cEven now today, if you are a person of color, we\u2019re still fighting for the same thing, the right to vote.\u201dBaker said she believes there is more work to be done getting equal pay for women and assuring women\u2019s right to control their reproductive health decisions. She would like to see Aug. 26 declared a holiday marking women\u2019s suffrage.And Baker said she would like to see more women win elective office. Although half the population is female, a much smaller percentage of elected officials are female.Of the 100 U.S. senators, for instance, 25 are women. In the U.S. House of Representatives, there are 101 women serving, about 23% of the total.For Baker, that is a legacy of sexism.\u201cI think it's because we live in a patriarchal society. Our society is sexist,\u201d Baker said. \u201cFrom what I can see and hear, I think it\u2019s the mentality of people thinking that men are more well-informed, the idea that women\u2019s place is in the home.\u201cEven in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was nominated, I heard several women say, \u2018I don\u2019t like her.\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018What about her skills and abilities?\u2019 Some women have continued to believe that men are more capable.\u201dStill, local women have made strides getting elected in recent years and decades.Beth Finch was elected the first female mayor of Fayetteville in 1975, serving until 1981. Finch, who died in 2012, remains the city\u2019s only woman mayor.In 1979, Evelyn Q. Parker assumed duties as Spring Lake\u2019s first female mayor, serving two terms. In 2000, Ethel Clark was sworn in as Spring Lake\u2019s first African-American woman mayor.And in 2011, Jackie Warner won election as Hope Mills\u2019 first woman mayor, a post she still holds. Kenjuana McCray, elected in 2019, is the town\u2019s first female and first African-American mayor pro tem.On the national level, Shirley Chisholm in 1972 became the first woman to run for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 1984, Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman nominated for vice president by a major party, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first female presidential candidate nominated by a major party. All three lost.Warner said she has been involved in politics most of her life, including high school and college offices. During a long career in education that included being\u00a0principal of Douglas Byrd High School, Warner said she was named Cumberland County\u2019s first female director of athletics when she was at South View High School in the early 1990s.Before being elected Hope Mills mayor, Warner ran for the N.C. House of Representatives, losing to Rick Glazier.\u201cIt didn't cross my mind at the time,\u201d Warner said of her election as Hope Mills\u2019 first female mayor. \u201cIt was brought to my attention during the campaign because somebody said, \u2018We\u2019ve never had a female mayor of Hope Mills.\u2019\u201dWarner said her accomplishment was brought home when she looked at the portraits of past mayors on display in Hope Mills Town Hall. All are men.Warner said one of the things that is most important to her is being a good role model as a female leader.\u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of women and women being involved in politics, but I think they have to take the role that they\u2019re setting the pace for those who follow,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my granddaughters to know that I worked hard to set a good example.\u201dBaker expressed a similar sentiment, while stressing that women in the public sphere still have a way to go.\u201cI\u2019m a great-grandmother and I have hope for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren and future generations,\u201d Baker said. \u201cMaybe one day, for future generations and generations throughout the world, it will be different.\u201dStaff writer Rodger Mullen can be reached at rmullen@fayobserver.com or 910-486-3561.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account My Print Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions BetMGM North Carolina Bonus Code Caesars North Carolina Promo Code ESPN BET North Carolina Promo Code bet365 North Carolina Bonus Code FanDuel North Carolina Promo Code DraftKings North Carolina Promo Code\u00a9 2024 www.fayobserver.com.
