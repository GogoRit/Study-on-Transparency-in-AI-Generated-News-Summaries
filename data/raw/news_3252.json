Wade.\nThis comes as the number of foster families in the state is on the decline. The organization says around 600 families across the state have walked away from fostering since just last year.\n\u00a0\nWhat You Need To Know\nThe Foster Family Alliance of North Carolina expects the number of children entering the system to rise after overturning of Roe\nFoster parent Rebekah Pipkin, 32, wants to bring attention to the overburdened system and encourage others to foster, especially those within the anti-abortion movement\nAt one time, Pipkin had six children in her home, including three of her own biological children\n\u00a0\nRebekah Pipkin has been a foster parent for three years. The 32-year-old is already a mom to her three biological girls. She says she and her husband felt called to foster care because of their Christian faith.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe opened our home. We took the classes, did all the background work and our home has been open for three years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pipkin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn that three years, we have had 20 children, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, and some have stayed for two hours. Our longest placement stayed for almost two years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRelated Stories\n\nAnti-abortion movement in North Carolina lays out plans to push for a ban in a post-Roe era\n\nGen Z activist says abortion rights will be an uphill battle in post-Roe world\n\nHow an N.C. woman decided the fate of her unplanned pregnancy\n\n Activist concerned about what abortion bans may mean for Black women\n\nFertility patient makes 'heartbreaking decision' to have an abortion during IVF journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has a wall in her house dedicated to artwork by her own children and foster children.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe try our very best to make them as much of our family as we can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pipkin said.\nPipkin, who is anti-abortion, feels like her side of the movement needs to support mothers beyond their pregnancies.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing pro-life is so much more than being anti-abortion, and I feel like sometimes that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where people miss the mark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey miss that pro-life means all life, so that means that once a baby is born, taking care of them, teenagers, toddlers, even the moms who are choosing life for their children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNorth Carolina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foster care system is already overwhelmed. Pipkin gets a call nearly every week to take a child in.\nThe Foster Family Alliance of North Carolina says that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preparing for crisis mode in a post-Roe world. The nonprofit organization gets its funding from the state to support foster care parents through their journey. They say the fear is that more children are going to be born that are unwanted.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBabies or unborn babies are easy to take care. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do anything but use your voice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pipkin said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re born that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the hard work starts, and people are not stepping up to do the hard work. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want teenagers in their house. Teenagers come with attitudes and trauma. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to care for someone who is not born, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more difficult once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re born.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPipkin says the goal of fostering is always reunification. She believes every child deserves a home. At one time, she had six children in her home, including her own.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a wild time, but it was fun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a lot of snacks, a lot of hanging out, a lot of laughter, a lot of \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorrys,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chaotic bedtimes, but it's always worth it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPipkin and her friend started the Wilson Foster Closet so community members can donate clothes, diapers, wipes or even used cribs. She says even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not able to foster, there are other ways to support families who do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            Contact\n        \n\n\n\n            About\n        \n\n\n\n            Spectrum News App\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            Certifications\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE\n        \n\n\n\n            Careers\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
