We are,\u201d said Watson. But, he said, the term \u201chas come to mean something totally different than the essence of what it is, which is something that I believe many of us across ethnic lines all agree with.\u201d\nJoining Jackson and Watson on the panel were G. Marcus Cole, the dean of Notre Dame Law School, EWTN radio host Gloria Purvis, and Harvard professor Jacqueline Rivers. Ernest Morrell, director of the Center for Literacy Education at Notre Dame, moderated the discussion.\nConsistency of support across life issues - including opposing racism and poverty - is key, all the panelists agreed.\n\u201cYou cannot ask a person to choose birth but not support that person\u2019s life and their opportunity at the American dream,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAt least give them the same opportunity that others have.\u201d\nShe noted that Planned Parenthood successfully advertises abortion for young women because they feel they have \u201cno resources\u201d to care for a child.\nThe connection among abortion, poverty, and racism runs deeper and wider than many in the pro-life movement are aware, panelists said, but it\u2019s a connection that needs to be made.\nThe poverty rate among black women is almost three times that of non-Hispanic white women, Rivers said, arguing that this is the result of historically racist laws and policies that were crafted to exclude black families from benefits which boosted other white families into the middle class and beyond.\nThis helped create a generational wealth gap between whites and African-Americans that exists to this day, Rivers said.\nIf pro-lifers became more acquainted with this history, she said, they could be seen as having an \u201cunderlying understanding of the depths of the problems\u201d of racism.\nGloria Purvis said winning broader support for the pro-life cause in the Black community require more \u201chumility\u201d from activists and politicians.\n\u201cStop trying to dictate to black people how they should vote, what should be their number one issue, or that somehow you know better than they do about what real racism is. Do not do that,\u201d Purvis said.\n\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, stop saying things like \u2018the\u00a0real\u00a0racism is abortion\u2019,\u201d she said, noting that pro-lifers should be able to talk about both racism and abortion without marginalizing either issue.\nIn line with the event\u2019s title, Purvis said treating racism as a life issue requires first that pro-lifers not deny it is an issue at all.\n\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, please, please, stop with the political talking points of the far-right. You will turn people off faster than you know what,\u201d Purvis said, giving examples of people bringing up \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d or black fathers being absent from their families in conversations about race, to argue that systemic racism doesn\u2019t exist.\nPurvis said the \u201cnumber one pushback\u201d she receives in her outreach is the belief that pro-lifers \u201conly care about black life in the womb when it comes to politics or election time.\u201d\n\n\n\nArticle Tags\nPro-Life, Racism\n \n\n\n\n\nMatt Hadro\n                        Catholic News Agency                    \n\n\n\nMatt Hadro\n                        Catholic News Agency                    \n\nMatt Hadro writes for Catholic News Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst religious order created to provide Montessori-style education\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nKate Qui\u00f1ones \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   4  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBehind the feud between Texas archdiocese and a defiant ministry group\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPeter Pinedo \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   3  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaint of the day: Joseph\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAngelus Staff \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   < 1  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee All\n\nRELATED ARTICLESThe pro-life movement must focus on Democrats after Roe  by Charles Camosy  January 21, 2022 Four recognized for their work in the pro-life movement  by Catholic News Service  October 25, 2022 Pro-life advocates: Planned Parenthood can\u2019t just wish away Margaret Sanger\u2019s racism, eugenics  by Catholic News Agency  April 20, 2021 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your day with Always Forward!\nA daily email newsletter to help you better understand the Church and the world.\n\nEnter your email address here\n\n*\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy.\n\n Sign Up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbout\nSubscribe\nAlways Forward Newsletter\nContact\nDonate\nArchdiocese of Los Angeles\nAdvertise\nRenew\nArchbishop Jos\u00e9 H.
