However, on his days off, when he is not in class, he becomes a self-described \"Pro-life Spiderman\" to protest abortion.    In May, days after the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion on Roe v. Wade, he scaled the 1,070-foot Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. Des Champs has also scaled the New York Times building and the Renaissance Center Tower in Detroit.\u00a0  Finance student Maison Des Champs climbs the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco. (Tucker Carlson Tonight screengrab)Des Champs told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Monday these were all acts of protest against abortion.\u00a0  \"We are in a cultural battle right now. I started this project because I wanted to inspire young people to speak out against abortion regardless of the backlash and the criticism that comes with being pro-life,\" he said.\u00a0  Des Champs told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" he wanted to raise money for Let Them Live, an organization that helps \"abortion-minded\" mothers financially and emotionally, according to its website. \u00a0  \"We are seeing states like California pay for abortions. There has never been a better time than now for us as pro-lifers to put our money where our mouths are and support LetThemLive.org and women in crisis,\" he said.AT LEAST 5 PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS VANDALIZED WITHIN A WEEK OF SCOTUS OPINION LEAK  Des Champs said he wanted to help the pro-life movement and started scaling skyscrapers because all he had was \"the gifts God gave me.\"\u00a0The UNLV senior said he practices rock climbing at Yosemite National Park and Red Rock Canyon, adding the skills to climb skyscrapers \"transfer over pretty easy, surprisingly.\"\u00a0  The view of Yosemite National Park as seen from the Glacier Point trail in California.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Tammy Webber, File)  Host Tucker Carlson questioned the legality of the skyscraper climbs, to which Des Champs responded he is usually arrested once he finishes.\u00a0    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"It's just to make an example out of me, so there's no copycat.
