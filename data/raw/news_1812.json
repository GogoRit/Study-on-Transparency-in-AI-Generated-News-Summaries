Wade (Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).\n\n\n\n\n\nMissouri\u2019s ban on abortion has had sweeping effects on health care, abortion rights advocates say \u2014 even though restrictions were already so severe many deemed the state \u201cpost-Roe\u201d long before the landmark case was overturned.\nSaturday marks one year since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional protections for the right to access abortion in the decision Dobbs v. Jackson, which left it up to states to determine abortion regulations.\u00a0\nMissouri, just minutes after the decision, was the first state to ban abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cEven under Roe, abortion was largely inaccessible in Missouri and Missourians were already forced to flee the state to access this basic essential health care,\u201d said Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri (formerly Pro-Choice Missouri). \u201cThe game has definitely changed.\u201d\nIn the years before the Dobbs decision, Missouri lawmakers and the state health department made it more difficult to access abortion, including by instituting waiting periods, parental consent laws, requiring patients receive a pelvic exam for a medication abortion and challenging abortion providers\u2019 licenses.\n\u201cAs a lobbyist for a number of decades, part of the legislation we would try to pass would be to attempt to chip away at Roe v. Wade,\u201d said Sam Lee of Campaign Life Missouri, who has lobbied against abortion for decades.\u00a0\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t a whole lot of abortions being done before the Dobbs decision,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThose women were going to Illinois or Kansas beforehand.\u201d\nThe clinics in bordering states that Missourians had long traveled to for abortions have recently been flooded with patients from across the country, delaying care even as the clinics have raced to expand hours and keep up.\u00a0\nAdvocates for abortion access also say the decision has had spillover effects on other parts of health care, sowing confusion over the legality of contraception and concern over doctors\u2019 discretion to provide emergency abortions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just folks who need abortion that are impacted. It is pregnancy care more broadly. It is folks who need medication\u2026to treat their chronic non-pregnancy related medical conditions,\u201d said Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood in the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri.\n\u201cAnd this is in a state that is at the bottom of the list for maternal mortality and morbidity,\u201d she added.\nIn the last year in Missouri, a hospital was cited for violating federal law by denying a patient an emergency abortion.\u00a0\nAnd the fight over putting abortion rights on the ballot continues to drag through the courts, with opposition from the state\u2019s attorney general.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile we believe that if Missourians had a chance to vote at the ballot box for abortion access that abortion access would win,\u201d Schwarz said, \u201cright now, there is so much remaining to be seen in what happens in the process that is underway.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the meantime, we are prepared to, and are using, every tool that we can to continue to build back that access.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n Diminishing access\n\nIn 1982 Missouri had 29 abortion providers and they performed 19,226 abortions, the most in any year since the Roe decision.\u00a0\nBy the time Roe fell, there was just one remaining abortion provider in Missouri and fewer than 100 abortions in the first half of 2022. Most Missourians\u00a0 \u2013 more than 3,000 \u2013 seeking abortions in 2020 did so outside of Missouri.\u00a0\nThe Dobbs decision brought more and more patients to the clinics Missourians had come to rely on.\nThe Planned Parenthood clinic in Fairview, Illinois, just miles from St. Louis, reported a 700% increase in patients from outside the bistate region of Missouri and Illinois in the 11 months after June 24, 2022.\u00a0\n  Dr. Colleen McNicholas, center, speaks Friday at Planned Parenthood Central West End alongside Rep. Cori Bush, D-St. Louis, right. (screenshot from Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region & Southwest Missouri Facebook livestream)\n\u201cBefore, we were able to get a patient in for abortion care within two to three days,\u201d McNicholas said. \u201cAnd now our wait times fluctuate between two and three weeks.\u201d\nLong wait times can cause patients to delay care beyond when they\u2019d like for a procedure in which time is of the essence, sometimes causing higher-risk abortions.\nThe spillover effects, advocates say, extend to pregnancy care and other realms of health care.\nSome advocates in Missouri and nationally have pointed to situations where doctors deny pregnant patients abortion-related care for fear of violating their states\u2019 laws \u2014 potentially endangering the patient.\n Medical uncertainty\n\nUnder Missouri\u2019s \u201ctrigger law\u201d law, passed in 2019, abortions are only permitted in cases of a medical emergency to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or when \u201ca delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\nHealth care providers who violate the law can be found guilty of a class B felony, which can result in five to 15 years in prison, and have their medical license suspended or revoked \u2014 it\u2019s up to local prosecutors and the attorney general to enforce that, and so far no doctor has been prosecuted under the Missouri law. People who receive abortions cannot be prosecuted in violation of the law.\u00a0\nThe first confirmed federal investigation of an alleged denial of abortion to a woman in a medical emergency was in Missouri last year.\u00a0\nMylissa Farmer first visited Freeman Health in August of last year, according to a federal report, when her water broke after almost 18 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\nShe was allegedly told her pregnancy was no longer viable but that the hospital could not terminate it because it was not immediately life-threatening for her and Missouri law prohibits abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detectable.\u00a0\nThe Missouri hospital was cited for denying an emergency abortion by federal regulators.\nRegarding the prospect of pregnant patients being denied emergency care, Lee, the anti-abortion lobbyist, said \u201cI don\u2019t have any data to suggest that that\u2019s true.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSo many women were leaving the state anyway, I don\u2019t know if this is making a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally just handfuls of women were having abortions in Missouri before the Dobbs decision, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a difference now anyway.\u201d\u00a0\nSince the Dobbs decision, Lisa Cox, spokesperson of the Department of Health and Senior Services, said, there have been 35 abortions reported to the state, which were under the medical emergency exemption.\u00a0\nThere is not yet national data to provide a comparison with other states and prior years\u2019 state abortion data does not identify abortions that were performed because of emergency.\n Contraceptive confusion\n\n  (Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images).\nAnother consequence of Dobbs, said Michelle Trupiano, executive director of Missouri Family Health Council Inc., has been confusion around the legality of contraception.\nSoon after Dobbs, a group of hospitals in Kansas City briefly stopped providing emergency contraception, which remains legal, and Trupiano said she fielded questions from providers and patients about contraception.\n\u201cAnd that was immediately, within the first few hours,\u201d Trupiano said at a roundtable event in St. Louis on Friday, \u201cand we still see that confusion across the state when it comes to emergency contraception.\u201d\nA poll conducted by the health policy research nonprofit KFF this year found that one-third of American adults said they are \u201cunsure\u201d if emergency contraception is legal in their state, though it is legal in all 50 states. Confusion about its legality is more pronounced in states where abortion is banned, the poll found. (That does not, however, show a difference in change over time \u2014 whether people are more confused now than pre-Dobbs.)\nThe emergency contraception pill works similarly to birth control pills, generally to prevent ovulation, but most adults incorrectly believe it can end early pregnancy, KFF found.\n\u201cPatients are scared. They\u2019re confused. They don\u2019t know who to trust for accurate information,\u201d Trupiano said. \u201cProviders feel that they\u2019re on very shaky ground, some even choosing to leave the state in order to fully practice without repercussions. And we\u2019ve spent so much time combating that misinformation.\u201d\n Political clash ahead\n\n Abortion rights won broad support in states where the issue was on the ballot last year, including neighboring Kansas (Noah Taborda/Kansas Reflector).\nA central goal of many abortion rights advocates in Missouri is to put abortion on the ballot \u2014 reversing Missouri\u2019s abortion ban by enshrining reproductive rights in the constitution.\nAdvocates have submitted 11 different versions of a ballot proposal to protect the right to reproductive freedom.\nAbortion rights won broad support in states where the issue was on the ballot last year, including neighboring Kansas.\u00a0\nThe legislature this year failed to pass a bill seeking to make it harder to amend the state constitution through the initiative petition process. Republicans pushing the bill argued initiative petition measures allow laws to be easily changed by big-money out of state interests.\nLegislative leaders made it clear the effort to increase the majority needed to pass a constitutional amendment was intended to block an abortion initiative.\n\u201cIf the Senate fails to take action on (initiative petition) reform, the Senate should be held accountable for allowing abortion to return to Missouri,\u201d House Speaker Dean Plocher, R-Des Peres said hours before session adjourned.\nHouse Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, thanked Plocher for saying \u201cthe quiet part out loud.\u201d\u00a0\nThough the legislature did not succeed in changing the initiative petition process, Attorney General Andrew Bailey is doing everything he can to prevent it from making the ballot. He is currently arguing he can refuse to certify a fiscal note summary on the cost of an abortion amendment in a case now in the state Supreme Court.\nLee said one focus of anti-abortion groups in the state is defeating any ballot measure that arises.\u00a0\nHe added that the anti-abortion movement needs to adjust to the reality of people ordering medication abortion by mail \u2014 that Dobbs \u201cdidn\u2019t end the battle. It just changed the battleground,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cThat just changes our emphasis,\u201d Lee said, \u201cand particularly, an emphasis on making sure that Missouri\u2019s pregnancy centers and maternity homes and other safety net programs are even more available to women who are considering having an abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nLegislation sponsored by Sen. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, to impose criminal penalties on women seeking abortion, did not advance very far. Both Lee and Susan Klein, who directs Missouri Right to Life, opposed the bill.\nAbortion rights advocates, Schwarz said, are working on several fronts: providing information about and access to contraception, canvassing and involving themselves in local municipal elections \u201cto build in protections for people at the local level, even while the state continues its attacks.\u201d\nMcNicholas said the effects of Dobbs are, after just one year, still unknown and emerging.\u00a0\n\u201cIt will take probably decades before we see the full impact of abortion bans,\u201d McNicholas said. \u201c\u2026This singular issue of abortion bans has impacted health care much more broadly than just abortion alone.\u201d\nThis story has been updated since it was first published.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXMissouri advocates say abortion ban has far-reaching effect on health care\nby Clara Bates, Missouri Independent June 24, 2023\nMissouri advocates say abortion ban has far-reaching effect on health care\nby Clara Bates, Missouri Independent June 24, 2023\n Missouri\u2019s ban on abortion has had sweeping effects on health care, abortion rights advocates say \u2014 even though restrictions were already so severe many deemed the state \u201cpost-Roe\u201d long before the landmark case was overturned.\nSaturday marks one year since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional protections for the right to access abortion in the decision Dobbs v.
