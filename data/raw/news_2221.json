Even if all there is is a heartbeat, that\u2019s life.\u201dIn addition to discussing his position on the issue of abortion, the 75-year-old Feliciano shared how his faith helped influence his career choice. When asked if God had a special plan for his life, he answered in the affirmative.Get Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.Subscribe\u201cIt seemed to me that before my parents read the Bible or did other things with me, God was pushing me into the music area. God was showing me the light ever since I was born,\" he said. \u201cSomehow at that age when I would hear my uncles playing music [in Puerto Rico], it seemed that God was sending me a message, that he was steering me in that direction.\u201d\u201cIn one sight being blind helped because if I would have been sighted, I probably would have been playing stick ball in the streets and not listening to the message that God was giving which was music all the time,\u201d he added. Feliciano recalled that when his father gave him a harmonica at the age of 4, he quickly developed an ability to play tunes on it.\u201cMy mother would go in the kitchen and sob uncontrollably because it really looked like a miracle. When she was crying, someone said, \u2018Listen, this has to be a sign from God,\u201d he recounted.Another person told Feliciano\u2019s father, who was distraught about having a blind child, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him being blind. You don\u2019t know what God has in store for him for the future.\u201d Looking back, Feliciano agrees, saying, \u201cTruer words were never spoken!\u201dFeliciano\u2019s conversion on the issue of abortion is not unique. Many other celebrities and political figures have credited the availability of ultrasound technology as the source of their conversion from pro-choice to pro-life.Former Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, explained that he had a pro-choice position on abortion until 1995, when his wife was pregnant with his daughter. \u201cMy wife and I went for a doctor\u2019s appointment, and she was not showing at all at that point. And I heard that heartbeat really strong,\u201d he said.\u201cIt turned it for me. On that ride home, I said my position is not justifiable. That\u2019s a life, and I cannot countenance the taking of that life.\u201dThe opportunity to view an ultrasound of an unborn baby transformed Abby Johnson from an \u201cemployee of the year\u201d at Planned Parenthood to an outspoken pro-life activist. When she was asked to assist with an ultrasound-guided abortion of a 13-week old baby, she \u201csaw this baby fight for his life against the abortion instruments.\u201d She said that before seeing the ultrasound image of the abortion taking place, she believed that \u201cthe unborn didn\u2019t have any sensory development, didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201dWas this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
