Women\u2019s March on January 18. The march was to promote women\u2019s rights, equality, representation in government, and a whole host of progressive causes, including reproductive rights, health care, climate action, native rights, and more.\n\nBefore the march began, the people gathered to hear from speakers that included local Native leaders, OC congressmember Katie Porter, and others.\n\u201cWhy are we here today?\u201d asked event MC Adele Tagaloa. \u201cWe are here because we are tired of being harassed, abused, underpaid, and ignored\u2026People are marching for economic and social justice for every community, and civil rights for everyone. We are marching for human rights, justice for people of color, the right to love who you will\u2026Women are marching for our reproductive health care rights and the right to make our own personal health decisions.\u201d\nThe event began with a blessing led by a group of women representing local Native American tribes.\n\u201cWe remember the generations of all women of all races and creeds who had the courage to march in the past so we could gather and march here today,\u201d said Lupe Lopez-Donaghey, a descendant of the Otomi/Yaqui tribes.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to thank you for including Native Women of these lands.\u201d\n\nOrange County Congressmember Katie Porter, elected in the historic 2018 midterm election, said, \u201cFor the fourth year now, the Women\u2019s March has brought us together to create a platform for men and women and kids to lift up the voices of everyone who feels like they are being silenced by this President\u2026When we have the courage to organize, to speak up, and to fight back, we have the power to make real change, to move our country forward.\u201d\nPorter hi-lighted the current struggle for women\u2019s health and reproductive rights.\n\u201cThe administration is in court right now fighting to take away protections for women\u2019s health care,\u201d Porter said. \u201cToo many women don\u2019t have access to basic reproductive health care. Every single day, the administration is trying to build those barriers higher and higher. And if we don\u2019t fight back, the crisis of access is only going to get worse. If we don\u2019t fight back, some women are going to die. You fight back with your voice and you fight back with your vote.\u201d\nPorter cited the energy created by the Women\u2019s March as contributing to the increasing number of women elected to office. These local elected officials were called onto the stage.\n\nKaelyn Dunnel, a junior at St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School where she is the co-president of the debate team, model United Nations, and Save the Children Clubs was the final speaker.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about my future. I\u2019m worried that through the small window of the classroom door there will come a fast, murderous bullet. I worry that there will be no future for my children because there will be no Earth. I worry that the next Maya Angelou or James Baldwin will be shot and killed before they can write the first word. I worry that wearing a tank top might be seen as an invitation to invade my body, a body that the government is trying to regulate and control. And I worry that only a heterosexual couple can hold hands in public. This is why we march. We are here today to stand for what we believe in: equity, freedom, and justice,\u201d Dunnel said.\nHere are some photos from the March, which wound its way through the streets of Downtown Santa Ana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this:TweetEmailLike this:Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n \n\nCategories: Local News \nTagged as: Featured Content, NewsletterTopStory \n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\nHomeless Crisis Has Many Faces in Fullerton\n\n\n\u201cMade in California\u201d Call for Submissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nProtect local journalism \u2013 please subscribe to the print edition or online edition of the Fullerton Observer.
