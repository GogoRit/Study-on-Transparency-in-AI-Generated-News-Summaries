The Witcher delivered on all of those fronts, as expected.AdvertisementFew would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve predicted, however, that the show would attempt high allegory, as it did in its third episode, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Betrayer Moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099; the episode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two main storylines work as an extended riff on reproductive rights and the long history of men \u00e2\u0080\u0098playing God\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over female bodies.A womb removed, a womb occupiedIn 1210, Yennefer of Vengerberg (Anya Chalotra), a quarter-elf sorceress (who has deformed facial features and a hunchback, which we are told comes with elf ancestry) is about to \u00e2\u0080\u0098graduate\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Her instructor Tissaia (MyAnna Buring), the Rector of Aretuza, tells her that she can choose to remake her body in an \u00e2\u0080\u0098ideal form\u00e2\u0080\u0099 upon graduation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the cost being she will never be able to have a child of her own. Bear in mind that the newly graduated sorceresses are each assigned to a king, to be their advisors and Yennefer has her eyes on the powerful king of Aedirn. When she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned to Nilfgaard instead (thanks to Stregobor, a powerful wizard and a cunning man) Yennefer angrily confronts the man who performs the \u00e2\u0080\u0098transformations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for all graduating sorceresses and goads him into giving her a new, conventionally attractive body through a combination of surgery and Elven magic. She then charms the king of Aedirn at the graduation ball (in defiance of Tisssaia) and before the night is over, she is his new advisor.In 1263, Geralt of Rivia (Cavill), the titular Witcher, has been hired by the Kingdom of Temeria to subdue but not kill a \u00e2\u0080\u0098striga\u00e2\u0080\u0099, a monster who Geralt refers to at one point as \u00e2\u0080\u009can overgrown abortion, a creature who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known only rage and hunger\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a woman cursed to become a flesh-eating monster during the full moon. The striga was an unborn child of incest \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Temeria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s King Foltest impregnated his sister Princess Adda, who died carrying the child. Enraged at Foltest and her death, the knight Ostrit (who was in love with Adda) curses him using an Elven charm, but the curse hits her unborn child instead, making her a striga. Geralt must keep the striga out of its crypt till dawn for the curse to reverse (the crypt is therefore a \u00e2\u0080\u0098dark womb\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for the monster).AdvertisementIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the plot elements; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how The Witcher cuts in and out of these two storylines that signals its ambitions. Consider Yennefer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation: the \u00e2\u0080\u0098surgeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tells her at the beginning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first draft. Lucky for you, I am the final artist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We later see him making red-coloured outlines on her face, much like a plastic surgeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-op mapping. He even tells her that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrazy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to undergo the procedure without anesthetic herbs. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what Yennefer does \u00e2\u0080\u0094 naked and shackled, she watches the surgeon rip out her womb, burn it to cinders, and slather her with a paste that includes the womb-powder, even as he chants in Elven. All of this happens within a literal ring of fire, on a Shakespearean \u00e2\u0080\u0098qayaamat ki raat\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (apocalyptic night) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much like the night when Geralt is fighting the striga near her crypt, over fifty years later.AdvertisementThe two sequences are intercut, raising the dramatic tension until Yennefer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primal scream resembles the striga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0094 finally, Geralt dives into the crypt and seals it shut magically, while Yennefer emerges in her new form, having broken her shackles (one womb removed, another occupied). Both of these women undergo physical transformations they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask for (Yennefer, we are told again and again, is not okay with the cost of transformation). In their own ways, they push back against the men who seek to control their bodies (the striga, before being captured, disembowels Ostrit, the man who placed the curse in the first place).AdvertisementYennefer wants good looks as a means to an end; she clearly rejects the idea of vanity at a couple of places in the episode. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to be powerful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says. In order to gain this power, she has to use her \u00e2\u0080\u0098manufactured\u00e2\u0080\u0099 looks as currency, and she does it expertly. This is certainly an underdog fighting back, but the show is also careful to place Yennefer in a morally grey area, especially with the suggestion that it might have been her who provided Ostrit with the Elven striga-curse, all those years later (before his death, Ostrit confesses that it was a woman, a magus who could speak Elven).AdvertisementNarrative techniques coming full circleThe Witcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegorical approach is both a critique of and a throwback to stereotypical depictions of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098caged woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from earlier eras \u00e2\u0080\u0094 chained patients of \u00e2\u0080\u0098hysteria\u00e2\u0080\u0099, female inmates at an asylum or indeed, women in labor. Because when it comes to reproductive rights, modern-day TV tends to favour the straightforward, plain-speaking approach.AdvertisementHulu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shrill debuted last year with the millennial protagonist Annie having an abortion halfway into the first episode, a notably low-key scene over in a minute and a half, barely referred to again (except for laughs). In 2016, Jane the Virgin dropped the fact of Jane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother Xiomara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abortion in a voice-over \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a narrative choice that would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been either soundly criticised or glorified to the heavens in the 90s or the mid-2000s, even. As it so happens, the episode fit right in with the ongoing TV era\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general insouciance.AdvertisementConsider how prime time TV engaged with reproductive rights in the 2000s.Boston Legal had two separate episodes dedicated to \u00e2\u0080\u0098Roe v Wade\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the 1973 ruling where the US Supreme Court declared that the American constitution protected a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to get an abortion without excessive governmental interference. During these episodes (\u00e2\u0080\u0098Roe vs Wade: The Musical\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Roe\u00e2\u0080\u0099, both aired in 2008), the characters make it clear that \u00e2\u0080\u009cabortion is not fun\u00e2\u0080\u009d (\u00e2\u0080\u0098Roe\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has an actual line to that effect) and therefore, the dominant narrative modes are pontification (James Spader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Alan Shore on one of his impassioned, interminable speeches) and rhetoric.AdvertisementBasically, campaign speeches are thinly disguised as dialogue, even if the underlying messaging is progressive (for its time). Boston Legal was a David E Kelley (The Practice, Ally McBeal) show and like Aaron Sorkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, that particular brand of white, male, \u00e2\u0080\u0098classical liberal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 polemic hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily aged that well (so many of The West Wing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speeches, for example, comes across as treacly and na\u00c3\u00afve in the post-Trump era).AdvertisementSo when Jane the Virgin and Shrill (and GLOW, to cite another recent stellar example) choose the straightforward, easygoing tone that they do, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a political rejection of the early 2000s-era liberal project in America. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098your words amounted to nothing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to pass the microphone\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Sorkin, notably, has asked younger progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstop acting like young people\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a mystifying demand ab initio).AdvertisementIronically, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another James Spader-starrer that has most recently pushed the needle on reproductive rights messaging \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the espionage drama The Blacklist.This cheerfully unrealistic CIA-and-terrorists show took an unexpectedly polemic turn during the seventh season episode \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hannah Hayes\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which involves Roe v Wade and male pregnancy. The Blacklist episodes are named after its fugitives, and in this case, Hannah Hayes (Stacey Roca) is a woman who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kidnapping conservative male governors, senators, lobbyists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 any man working on anti-abortion legislation \u00e2\u0080\u0094and keeping them in a prison in her basement. The captives are made to undergo two procedures, one implanting an artificial womb inside them, and another to place a fertilised embryo within that womb. Hayes only releases the captives after a viable heartbeat is registered \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the captives are implied to be residents of a state where an abortion is illegal post the heartbeat.AdvertisementBy the end of the episode, we know her motives: she was raped by a man and denied abortion in her home state. Although she came to love her child, her rapist later filed for parental rights once he got out of prison \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she snapped, captured and imprisoned him in her basement. She later uses his sperm to impregnate the governor as well as the lobbyist.Essentially, the episode is a thought experiment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it \u00e2\u0080\u0098tests\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a popular piece of rhetoric, ie the idea that \u00e2\u0080\u0098if men could conceive, abortions would be freely available for everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Does it work, then? The Blacklist seems to think so, for all of the powerful men impregnated by Hayes are remorseful by the end of the episode (not to mention traumatised), although we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see whether they actually stop lobbying against abortion. One thing is clear: they now know exactly what it feels like to lose control over one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own body, and to have that lack-of-control affect their lives permanently.\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hannah Hayes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 works as a wish fulfilment fantasy, whereas The Witcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Betrayer Moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099 works both as an \u00e2\u0080\u0098instructional\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fable and as a meta-commentary on the florid ways in which Hollywood has engaged with a human rights issue. Standing on opposite ends of the narrative spectrum (one is a pre-modern allegory, the other is literalised rhetoric), they signal a new, aggressive direction for this discourse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing.Continue ReadingTagsBuzzPatrol\nBuzz Patrol\nThe Witcher\nHenry Cavill\nGame of Thrones\nBu\nJames Spader\nJane the Virgin\nThe Blacklist\nGeralt of RiviaFind us on YouTubeSubscribeTop Shows\n\n\nRelated Stories'Bigg Boss' fame Nimrit Kaur passes on her role in 'Love Sex Aur Dhokha 2' due to explicit scenes: ReportCrew: Singer Badshah drops teaser of his collaboration with Diljit Dosanjh from Kareena Kapoor, Tabu, Kriti Sanon's comedyAnant Ambani-Radhika Merchant's Pre-Wedding Festivities: Saif Ali Khan-Kareena Kapoor, Ranveer Singh-Deepika Padukone exude royalty for the 'Desi Romance' themeWATCH: Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan dance on 'Naatu Naatu' at Anant Ambani-Radhika Merchant's pre-wedding festivities'Bigg Boss' fame Nimrit Kaur passes on her role in 'Love Sex Aur Dhokha 2' due to explicit scenes: ReportCrew: Singer Badshah drops teaser of his collaboration with Diljit Dosanjh from Kareena Kapoor, Tabu, Kriti Sanon's comedyAnant Ambani-Radhika Merchant's Pre-Wedding Festivities: Saif Ali Khan-Kareena Kapoor, Ranveer Singh-Deepika Padukone exude royalty for the 'Desi Romance' themeWATCH: Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan dance on 'Naatu Naatu' at Anant Ambani-Radhika Merchant's pre-wedding festivities\nAbout FirstpostMost Searched CategoriesWeb StoriesWorldIndiaExplainersOpinionSportsCricketTech/AutoEntertainmentVantageNETWORK18 SITESNews18Money ControlCNBC TV18Forbes IndiaSitemap\n\n\n\nis on YouTubeSubscribe NowCopyright @ 2024.
