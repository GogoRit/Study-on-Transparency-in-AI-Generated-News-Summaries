Doug Burgum released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court opinion issued today that effectively overturns Roe v. Wade and allows states to set their own laws related to abortion. \u00a0\n\u201cToday\u2019s landmark Supreme Court decision returns power to the states where it belongs,\u201d Burgum said. \u201cOur administration has consistently supported pro-life legislation and this decision is a victory for the many North Dakotans who have fought so hard and for so long to protect the unborn in our state. We will now work diligently with the North Dakota Attorney General\u2019s Office to fulfill our constitutional duty by carrying out the 2007 legislation that is triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. We must now turn to prioritizing women\u2019s health, including expectant mothers and children in need.\u201d\nThe 2007 Legislature passed a law that makes it a Class C felony to perform an abortion in North Dakota except to save the life of the mother or in the case of rape or incest. The law, North Dakota Century Code 12.1-31-12, will take effect on the 30th day after the North Dakota Attorney General certifies to Legislative Council that the U.S. Supreme Court has restored to the states the authority to prohibit abortion. \u00a0\n\n\n<< All News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Office of Governor, State of North Dakota600 East Boulevard Avenue Bismarck, ND 58505-0100Phone:\u00a0701.328.2200\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nContact\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSecurity Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback (+)Provide Website Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
