Activists warned the international community that the world risks a roll back in women\u2019s rights if necessary efforts are not urgently undertaken.\n(Istanbul, 29 April) \u2013 128 women\u2019s organizations and activists from 17 countries and Kosovo [1] called upon governments and development partners to ensure effective dialogue with civil society to put women\u2019s needs at the centre of COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery efforts.\nIn Central Asia, Eastern Partnership and Western Balkans and Turkey sub-regional consultations, organized by the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, women\u2019s rights activists highlighted the various challenges women and women\u2019s organizations are facing during the crisis and offered solutions to address pressing issues. Participants included women\u2019s organizations and activists already working on the front lines of COVID-19 response.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s organizations and civil society at large should be an integral part of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, they\u2019ve been on the front lines, working day and night to respond to the needs of all groups of women and girls, men and boys. They know what needs to be done and we urge all development partners to seriously consider the solutions they offer so that we can continue to ensure the principles of equality and social justice\u201d said Alia El-Yassir, the UN Women Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia.\nWomen\u2019s organizations stressed their lack of engagement in national COVID-19 response and recovery planning as a key challenge that blindfolds current efforts in responding to the urgent needs of women and girls. They highlighted the need for their oversight and monitoring of COVID-19 actions and spending. Women\u2019s organizations also emphasized the need for gender disaggregated data and statistics to paint a clear picture of women\u2019s challenges during the crisis, which would pave the way for gender-responsive policy-making. As persistent issues that carry a potential to roll into bigger problems down the line, women\u2019s organizations highlighted restrictions in women\u2019s rights and access to justice, increases in women\u2019s unpaid work at home, and loss of employment and income by women, who globally dominate insecure and informal economy.\nAll the women\u2019s organizations are gravely concerned that social distancing and lockdown measures have triggered additional risk of domestic violence. In Kazakhstan and other countries, there are concerns that women cannot call police due to proximity of the perpetrator, so incidence is likely to be even higher than reported. In Turkey, 21 women were murdered during quarantine between 11 and 31 March [2].\nWomen\u2019s organizations also stressed the need to create an enabling environment for civil society to operate in during and after the pandemic. \u201cEven before the crisis, we faced the problem of shrinking space for civil society, especially for women\u2019s groups. Now it\u2019s worse. I\u2019m afraid civil society organizations will disappear from the scene because of the funding cuts for human rights work which will affect the services we are providing,\u201d said Diana \u0160ehi\u0107, representing \u201cRights for All\u201d organization in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nEach woman brought their own unique perspective from working with diverse groups of women and girls, some being at most risk of being left behind during COVID-19, including older women, women with disabilities, women living with HIV, women refugees and migrant and rural women.\n\u201cEngagement in informal work, lack of civil registration and challenges to access social services make Roma women invisible for state institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. They ask for assistance but are not counted in the official database as employees who lost their jobs, nor as beneficiaries of state social aid,\u201d said Manjola Veizi from the Roma Women\u2019s Rights Centre in Albania.\nWomen\u2019s organizations provided the following recommendations to governments for more gender-responsive efforts to respond to the pandemic:\n\nEstablish standing consultative mechanisms with women\u2019s organizations to ensure that their needs and priorities directly influence and inform COVID-19 response efforts\n\n\nGenerate sex and age disaggregated research and data\n\n\nUphold all internationally agreed human rights standards in every aspect of pandemic response, ensuring equality and non-discrimination for all, including the labour, health and reproductive rights of women.\n\n\nWork with women\u2019s groups and civil society organizations to provide targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups, including social, economic, legal and psychological support\n\n\nEnsure on-going and additional funding for women\u2019s groups and civil society organizations so that they can continue their programmes and launch new ones to respond to the pandemic\n\n\nCompensate for lost income through one-time monetary disbursements\n\nFind the full recommendations for governments and development partners and the consultation summary here.\nMedia contact:\nGizem Yarbil Gurol\nRegional Communications Specialist, UN Women Europe and Central Asiagizem.yarbil@unwomen.org\n[1] All references to Kosovo shall be understood to be in full compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999).\n[2] We Will Stop Women\u2019s Murder Platform\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nWorld\n\nOther countries\n\nAlbaniaArmeniaAzerbaijanBelarusBosnia and HerzegovinaCroatiaGeorgiaKazakhstanKyrgyzstanMoldovaSerbiaTajikistanthe Republic of North MacedoniaT\u00fcrkiyeTurkmenistanUkraineUzbekistan\n\nSource\n\nUN Women\n\nFormat\n\nAnalysis\n\nThemes\n\nHealthProtection and Human Rights\n\nDisaster type\n\nEpidemic\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nUkraine\n\nUkraine: Humanitarian Impact of Recent Attacks in the South, East and North-East - Flash Update #1 (Last Updated: 19 Mar 2024)\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nOCHA\n\nPosted\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine\n\nInternational Rescue Committee (IRC) in Ukraine [EN/UK]\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            News and Press Release          \nSource\n\nIRC\n\nPosted\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n15 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n+ 9 more\n\nCoordination breakdown: the impacts of COVID-19 on migration in Europe\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Analysis          \nSource\n\nMPI\n\nPosted\n\n14 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n14 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\nLessons from COVID-19: Managing borders in the next global public-health crisis\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Analysis          \nSource\n\nMPI\n\nPosted\n\n14 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n14 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
