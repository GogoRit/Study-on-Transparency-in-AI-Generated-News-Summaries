Find the rest of the series here.\n\nSen. Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, is as conservative and \"pro-life\" as they come.\r\n\nSince joining the Texas Senate in 2007, Nichols has supported landmark anti-abortion legislation in the state, including Senate Bill 8, which allows anyone to enforce the ban of abortions after about six weeks of gestation.\r\n\nHe also voted for a bill \u2014 now law \u2014 that makes doctors performing an abortion subject to felony charges and up to life in prison.\r\n\nThese bills prohibit the procedure unless the life of the mother is at risk. But in September, Nichols revealed a new stance on the issue.\r\n\n\u201cIf I get a chance to vote for an exception to rape I would vote \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d he said during the Texas Tribune Festival in September. \u201cI think that instead of us telling women what they can do, I think we should ... show our support for the women of this state, the young families.\u201d\r\n\nThat day Nichols became the first Republican senator to say publicly he\u2019d be in favor of changing Texas\u2019 abortion bans.\r\n\nHis comments came months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade and after disturbing reports across the country \u2014 and in Texas \u2014 about pregnancy complications turning into life and death moments, because doctors were worried about breaking abortion laws.\r\n\nThere have also been reports of young rape victims being forced to have children.\r\n\nIn response, some Republican lawmakers who pushed for abortion bans are now saying they\u2019d be open to add an exception provision for rape and incest.\r\n\nNichols is one of them.\r\n\n\u201cI hear a lot of wonderful stories of how somebody was raped and made the decision to keep that child and then adopt it out when it was born,\u201d Nichols told The Texas Newsroom after the Tribune panel. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also heard a lot of horror stories related to trauma, mental breakdowns, and things like that; it\u2019s like the trauma of the rape is not over.\u201d\r\n\nBut he doesn't have much power when it comes to reproductive health legislation since he\u2019s not leading any committee that focuses on abortion bills.\r\n\nBesides, Nichols doesn\u2019t have the appetite to spearhead this fight. He said he will not author any bill during next year\u2019s legislative session that would accomplish such change.\r\n\n\n\nA political move\n\n\nBrendan Steinhauser, a GOP strategist who has led the campaigns of U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and Congressman Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, said he\u2019s not surprised by Nichols' reluctance.\r\n\n\u201cI think this is probably more of a campaign operation than a legislative push,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more something that they\u2019re doing in the election window to put their position out there for the public to know about.\u201d\r\n\nAdditionally, the Republicans who support changing the law are doing so knowing that a GOP-led Legislature will not move forward with such a proposal, Steinhauser said.\r\n\nIn the unlikely case lawmakers pass an exception bill, it would be up to Gov. Greg Abbott, who's running for a third term, to sign it.\r\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Republican has not wanted to answer the question directly and has instead deflected to clarifying the law when it comes to the health of the mother.\r\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ve been some comments and even maybe some actions by some doctors that are not taking care of women who have an ectopic pregnancy or who have a miscarriage,\u201d Abbott said in a recent interview with Dallas TV station WFAA. \u201cThat is wrong because neither of those are abortions.\u201d\r\n\nIn other instances, when asked about an exception for rape, Abbott said his administration would \u201celiminate all rapists.\u201d\n\n\n\nPushback from conservatives\n\n\nStill, a handful of Republican lawmakers have publicly said they'd support adding an exception.\r\n\nBut many others, however, have refused to even address the issue.\r\n\nThe Texas Newsroom reached out to seven female lawmakers who sponsored the abortion bans \u2014 none of them replied to requests for an interview.\r\n\nA reason might be the fear of political pushback from members of their own party, or anti-abortion organizations like Texas Right to Life.\r\n\nThe organization gives state lawmakers a rating based on their stances on abortion. Voting to ban the procedure gives a candidate a higher score \u2014 one conservatives can tout on the campaign trail.\r\n\nNichols has gotten 100% in years past. But after his comments in September, Texas Right to Life withdrew its endorsement.\r\n\n \n\nJohn Seago, the president of Texas Right to Life, told The Texas Newsroom the organization has a rigorous endorsement policy, and that Nichols' actions mean something bigger for them.\r\n\n\u201cIt exposes kind of a failure of understanding the pro-life position,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if someone is now openly supporting exceptions to protecting innocent human life in the womb, it really shows that there are some children that they don\u2019t fully see as human.\u201d\r\n\nSeago said he wants those who are against abortion to do everything they can to continue preventing the procedure from happening.\r\n\nDuring next year\u2019s legislative session, he said, Texas Right to Life will be working with lawmakers to pass legislation that would strengthen the enforcement mechanisms of the state\u2019s anti-abortion laws.\r\n\nThat includes stopping companies from mailing abortion-inducing drugs to Texans, as well as going after district attorneys who have said they will not prosecute those who violate abortion laws.\r\n\u201cJust because Roe v. Wade was overturned it doesn\u2019t mean Texas is going to be abortion-free,\u201d Seago said. \u201cWe really need some more tools on the table to actually stop them from happening.\u201d \r\n Copyright 2022 KUT 90.5.
