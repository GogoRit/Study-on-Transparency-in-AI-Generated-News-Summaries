Sign up for our daily newsletter.\nAbortion in Iowa will remain available until 22 weeks of pregnancy as a lawsuit against the newly enacted six-week ban proceeds, a state judge ruled Monday.\nThe Iowa state legislature convened last week for a single day with the express purpose of passing a new six-week ban. The law, which Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed last Friday, includes exceptions for people pregnant because of rape and incest, but requires those cases to be reported to a \u201claw enforcement agency or to a public or private health agency\u201d within 45 or 145 days, respectively. That represents a significant hurdle, since most cases of rape and incest are never reported. The ban also includes narrow exceptions for \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d or if the fetus was found to be \u201cincompatible with life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are deeply relieved that the court granted this relief so essential health care in Iowa can continue. We are also acutely aware that the relief is only pending further litigation and the future of abortion in Iowa remains tenuous and threatened,\u201d said\u00a0Dr. Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director of the Emma Goldman Clinic, one of six abortion clinics in the state.\nThe ban blocked Monday \u2014\u00a0which was in effect for just over 72 hours \u2014 represents a second attempt by state Republicans to ban abortion early in pregnancy. It is almost identical to a law passed in 2018, which state courts had blocked from taking effect, citing federal abortion rights protected by Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Previous Coverage:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Coverage:\n\n                        Iowa lawmakers pass six-week abortion ban in one-day special session\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Roe\u2019s overturn in June 2022, Reynolds asked the courts to reconsider their decision. A district court held that the law still violated Iowa\u2019s constitution. The governor appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court, which on June 16 deadlocked 3-3 over whether to let the ban be enforced,\u00a0meaning that the lower court\u2019s decision blocking the 2018 ban remained in effect.\n\u201cThe court believes it must follow current Iowa Supreme Court precedent and preserve the status quo ante while this litigation and adversarial presentation which our Supreme Court has invited moves forward,\u201d Judge Joseph Seidlin wrote.\nThe state is expected to appeal the new block on the six-week ban. And it is possible that as the case moves forward, the state\u2019s Supreme Court could ultimately decide to uphold a six-week ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        As Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signs abortion bill, her power in GOP is on full display\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision will keep Iowa, for now, on a shrinking list of states in the Midwest to allow abortion for most of pregnancy. Nebraska recently passed a 12-week ban set to take effect October 1. Indiana\u2019s near-total ban will be enforced starting August 1. And courts in Ohio are still weighing whether to let the state\u2019s six-week ban take effect once again.\nIf Iowa\u2019s ban were to take effect, residents would likely have to travel to Kansas, Illinois, Minnesota and Ohio for abortions. It\u2019s unlikely the clinics in those states will have the bandwidth to care for everyone. Kansas and Illinois have experienced some of the country\u2019s largest increases in abortion patients since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and clinics in both states have already reported significant increases in waiting times for appointments.\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa lawmakers pass six-week abortion ban in one-day special session\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: 15-week abortion bans may become law in three states.
