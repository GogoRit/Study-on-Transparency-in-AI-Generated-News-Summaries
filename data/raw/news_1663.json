Wade. (Kate Masters / Virginia Mercury)\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite backers characterizing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s proposal to largely ban abortions after 15 weeks in Virginia as \u201ca consensus\u201d position, a Senate panel Friday rejected it, with one Republican joining unanimous Democratic opposition.\u00a0\n\u201cI wish I could vote for this bill,\u201d said Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, a practicing OB-GYN who proposed an amendment to the administration bill that would have allowed exceptions up to 24 weeks for fetuses with severe abnormalities. \u201cBut without that exception, I\u2019m going to have to vote\u201d against it.\u00a0\nThe Friday morning votes on three bills that would have restricted to varying degrees Virginia\u2019s current abortion laws were not binding: The Democrat-dominated Senate Health Professions Subcommittee only has the power to recommend legislative positions to the larger Health and Education Committee. But they signal little appetite among Democrats to brook any change to the state\u2019s abortion laws, which allow the procedure through the first and second trimesters with few restrictions and permit it in the third if three doctors decide continuing the pregnancy would pose a severe risk to the mother.\nDunnavant called that law \u201cextreme,\u201d arguing Virginia is out of step with laws across the U.S. and Europe as well as medical science on fetal age of viability. Under her Senate Bill 1483, abortion would remain legal up to \u201cviability,\u201d defined as 24 weeks or \u201cat least 22\u201d in the estimation of three doctors. Dunnavant\u2019s bill would also require abortions be performed only in hospitals, mirroring the current law on the second and third trimesters.\nAbortion would also be allowed if the pregnancy was nonviable and going forward with it \u201cwould substantially and irremediably impair the physical health of the woman.\u201d\nFrom start to finish, 2023 will be a big year for abortion policy in Virginia\n\n\u201cThe public opinion is in favor of not having abortion in the third trimester,\u201d\u00a0 Dunnavant said.\u00a0\nThe two other Republican bills up for consideration Friday would go further. Sen. Steve Newman\u2019s Senate Bill 1385 \u2014 the bill being backed by the Youngkin administration \u2014 would prohibit abortion after 15 weeks unless the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or would result in the death of the mother \u201cor substantially and irreversibly impair\u201d her \u201cbodily functions,\u201d not including \u201cpsychological or emotional conditions.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe think we have what\u2019s a carefully crafted bill that also supports mothers,\u201d said Newman, who called the proposal a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d that provides \u201ccommon-sense protection for the unborn.\u201d\u00a0\nSen. Travis Hackworth\u2019s Senate Bill 1284, which he described as \u201ca life at conception bill,\u201d offered the most restrictive option, banning all abortion except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk or prior to 20 weeks if an official police report has been filed alleging rape or incest occurred.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen Roe v. Wade was overturned, I knew this was the bill I had to put in,\u201d he said. Pointing to unanimous support last year for legislation to impose stricter regulations on a controversial beagle breeding facility in Cumberland County that has since been shut down, he told the Senate panel, \u201cI hope we can be as passionate in saving the lives of the unborn children as we were for the beagles last year.\u201d\u00a0\nWitnesses turned out to argue both for and against the three measures, with supporters focusing on fetal pain and opponents contending the proposals would interfere with the patient-doctor relationship.\u00a0\nSeveral women pointed to their own experiences as instructive. One woman who identified herself as Molly said she had considered abortion but was glad she decided to continue with the pregnancy.\n\u201cWhen I took my pregnancy test, I could never have imagined all the wonderful support I\u2019ve gotten,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nJessica Gertz, a Richmond doctor, told the Senate panel she had undergone an abortion at 21 weeks after finding out her fetus had severe abnormalities that could have left it unable to breathe or without a heartbeat after delivery.\u00a0\n\u201cMake no mistake, the bans proposed today are aimed at people exactly like me,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nLawmakers on the subcommittee had little discussion on the three measures before voting 6-3 to recommend that Hackworth\u2019s and Newman\u2019s bills be rejected by the larger committee and 5-4 to recommend rejection of Dunnavant\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRepublican senator breaks with GOP to oppose 15-week abortion bill in Virginia\nby Sarah Vogelsong, Virginia Mercury January 20, 2023\nRepublican senator breaks with GOP to oppose 15-week abortion bill in Virginia\nby Sarah Vogelsong, Virginia Mercury January 20, 2023\n Despite backers characterizing Republican Gov.
