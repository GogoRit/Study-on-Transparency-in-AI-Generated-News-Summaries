(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the exemptions, arguing that they would place a burden on state agencies, since women would turn to them for help.\n(*Updated at 3:43 pm. on 7/8/20, to include comment from the Women\u2019s Law Center)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Trump administration effort to exempt employers with religious or moral concerns from complying with a \u201cbirth control mandate\u201d in the Affordable Care Act, the Obama-era law that requires employer-provided insurance plans to cover contraceptives.\nReproductive rights advocates say the ruling\u00a0potentially affects hundreds of thousands of people seeking birth control and vastly expands the universe of potential exemptions to the law.\nIt was one of a pair of 7-2 decisions the court issued on Wednesday in which liberal justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer joined the court\u2019s conservative majority. In the other, the court threw out a pair of workplace discrimination lawsuits filed by teachers at religious schools.\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented in both.\nThe birth control provision in the ACA dates to 2011 when the Obama administration said employers and insurers had to provide birth control at no cost. Houses of worship were exempted but not nonprofits affiliated with religious organizations.\nThe Trump administration\u00a0finalized new rules\u00a0in 2018 that expanded exemptions to employers based on religious or moral beliefs. Pennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the new exemptions, arguing that they would place a burden on state agencies as women would turn to them for help. A federal judge in Philadelphia agreed and issued a\u00a0nationwide injunction\u00a0in January 2019 to block the rules from taking effect.\nA federal appeals court upheld that decision, prompting the Trump administration and the Roman Catholic organization at the heart of the case \u2014 Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home in Pittsburgh \u2014 to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\u201cFor the past seven years, they \u2014 like many other religious objectors who have participated in the litigation and rulemakings leading up to today\u2019s decision \u2014 have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0wrote\u00a0in the majority opinion.\nThe federal government, he continued, \u201chas arrived at a solution that exempts the Little Sisters from the source of their complicity-based concerns \u2014 the administratively imposed contraceptive mandate. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand.\u201d\nChief Justice John Roberts joined the opinion, as did Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Kagan and Breyer agreed that the case should be remanded back to the lower court but did not join the majority opinion.\nIn her dissent, Ginsburg said the decision \u201cleaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer\u2019s insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets,\u201d The \u201cfree exercise clause in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, she added, \u201cdoes not call for that imbalanced result.\u201d\nAdam Sonfield, associate director of policy analysis at the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice think tank, said the ruling severely undermines contraceptive coverage guarantee under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThis would be a harmful outcome under any circumstances, and particularly during a pandemic and a recession,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cIf we step back, we can see the pattern and the underlying, coercive motivations behind the Trump administration\u2019s actions. This attack on private insurance coverage of contraception is tied to the administration\u2019s destructive overhaul of the Title X national family planning program, its relentless attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act, its harmful \u2018refusal of care\u2019 rules, and its ongoing efforts to \u2018defund\u2019 Planned Parenthood and undermine Medicaid coverage of family planning care.\u201d\n\n\nEmily Callen, executive director of Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates, decried the decision in a statement obtained by the Capital-Star.\n\u201cIn siding with the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing assault on reproductive healthcare, the Supreme Court effectively gave license to schools and employers to deny their students and workers access to contraceptive coverage guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Callen said. \u201cThis decision is especially harmful to Black and Latina women and members of the LGBTQ community, who already face higher barriers to health care.\u201d\nTaking to Twitter, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro vowed, despite the defeat, to keep opposing the administration\u2019s efforts to chip away at the Affordable Care Act.\nSince the day they took office, the Trump administration has been dead set on hacking away at the Affordable Care Act. As long as I serve the people of [Pennsylvania], I will continue to fight for people\u2019s right to healthcare and reproductive justice,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nSince the day they took office, the Trump Administration has been dead set on hacking away at the Affordable Care Act. \nAs long as I serve the people of PA, I will continue to fight for people\u2019s right to healthcare and reproductive justice.\n\u2014 AG Josh Shapiro (@PAAttorneyGen) July 8, 2020\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Women\u2019s Law Center, which filed an amicus brief in the case, was similarly critical, saying the ruling would deprive women of critical healthcare.\n\u201cEquitable access to contraception is universally recognized by public health authorities as essential for women\u2019s health,\u201d Susan J. Frietsche, the senior staff attorney and director of WLP\u2019s Western Pennsylvania office, said in a statement. \u201cIt reduces unintended pregnancy, abortions, and maternal mortality.\u201d\nArizona, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee are among the states that argued\u00a0in an amicus brief\u00a0that \u201cthe federal government rightly sought to provide an exemption to the Little Sisters of the Poor and similarly situated objectors, and the lower courts were wrong to stand in the way.\u201d\nMaine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia are among the states opposed to the administration\u2019s policies. They told the Supreme Court in an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0that the administration\u2019s exemptions \u201cmake women\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage contingent on the religious and moral approval of their employers\u201d and that Congress intended for women to have full and equal coverage for preventive health care.\u201d\nThe court heard\u00a0Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania\u00a0and consolidated arguments in\u00a0Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru\u00a0and\u00a0St. James School v. Biel\u00a0in May.\nWorkplace discrimination\nIn the workplace rights case, the same seven-justice majority found that federal employment discrimination laws don\u2019t apply to teachers at religious schools.\nThe case involves a pair of elementary teachers at two Catholic schools in California \u2014 Kristen Biel and Agnes Morrissey-Berru \u2014 who sued their employers after learning their contracts wouldn\u2019t be renewed.\nBiel, who is now deceased, charged the school with discriminating against her because she had breast cancer. Morrissey-Berru charged her employer with age discrimination.\nLawyers for both argued that the schools violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits workplace discrimination against people on the basis of disability, age, race, sex and other characteristics.\nBut federal trial courts disagreed, citing a legal doctrine that prohibits ministers from suing religious institutions for employment discrimination. The so-called ministerial exception is designed to preserve the separation of church and state by preventing governments from interfering in religious matters.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed the lower court rulings on the grounds that the exception does not apply to Biel and Morrissey because, as teachers, they did not play the same kind of leadership role that ministers do.\nBut the high court disagreed. In his majority opinion, Alito\u00a0explained\u00a0that \u201cthe religious education and formation of students is the very reason for the existence of most private religious schools, and therefore the selection and supervision of the teachers upon whom the schools rely to do this work lie at the core of their mission.\u201d\nThe First Amendment, he noted, allows religious institutions \u201cto decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.\u201d\nRoberts, Thomas, Breyer, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh joined.\nIn her dissenting opinion, Sotomayor called the result \u201cprofoundly unfair.\u201d The court, she said, \u201cis not only wrong on the facts, but its error also risks upending anti-discrimination protections for many employees of religious entities.\u201d\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, filed a\u00a0brief\u00a0on behalf of the teachers, urging the high court to affirm the appellate court ruling. Attorneys general for Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada were among those that signed on.\nThe brief said states have a substantial interest in the case because the court\u2019s decision defines the \u201cboundaries of the balance\u201d between employers\u2019 rights to religious autonomy and employees\u2019 right to freedom from discrimination.\nMost states ban employment discrimination on the basis of age and disability,\u00a0according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nPennsylvania bans discrimination based on: Race, color, familial status, religious creed, ancestry, age 40 and above, sex, pregnancy, national origin, disability, use of service animal, refusal to perform abortion or sterilization, retaliation. For public employers, sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination is banned by executive order, according to NCSL.\n\n\nLast year, more than 70,000 discrimination complaints were\u00a0filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. More than a third of those were filed on the basis of disability, and more than a fifth on the basis of age. Less than 4% were filed on the basis of religion.\nA full rundown for Pennsylvania can be viewed here.\nWednesday\u2019s decision comes on the heels of another victory for religious schools last month, when the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0that states must grant them access to the public funding they make available for private secular schools.\u00a0Nearly 6 million students across the country attend some 35,000 private schools, most of which are religious,\u00a0according to the Council for American Private Education.\nEarlier in the month,\u00a0the court expanded protections from workplace discrimination in a ruling\u00a0that employers can\u2019t legally fire people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. In a 6-3\u00a0opinion, the court ruled that employers who fire individuals \u201cmerely for being gay or transgender\u201d violate the Civil Rights Act.\nAlso last month, the court\u00a0struck down\u00a0a Louisiana law that critics said would have severely limited access to abortion in Louisiana and opened the door to further abortion limitations around the country. Enacted in 2014 by the Louisiana state Legislature, the law would have required physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\nCapital-Star Editor John L.
