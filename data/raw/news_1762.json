  \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Advocates who counsel and aid Idaho teenagers seeking abortion care filed suit Tuesday against Republican Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador in a bid to overturn the state\u2019s abortion travel ban.\n    \n\n            The travel ban, which\u00a0took effect May 5, created the crime of \u201cabortion trafficking,\u201d punishable by a minimum of two years in prison. It forbids helping a person under 18 years old obtain abortion pills or leave the state for abortion care without parental permission.\n    \n\n            The complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, says the ban infringes on the right to interstate travel and on First Amendment rights to speak about abortion and \u201cengage in expressive conduct, including providing monies and transportation (and other support) for pregnant minors traveling within and outside of Idaho.\u201d\n    \n\n            The suit also says the travel ban \u201clacks clarity\u201d and \u201cinvites arbitrary enforcement,\u201d raising the specter of traffic stops of girls of reproductive age, and infringes on the right of people to cross the border into neighboring states, including Washington, where minors can legally obtain abortion care without parental consent.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather and Nicholas Maberry.\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky couple \u2018furious\u2019 state abortion laws meant they couldn\u2019t hold their daughter to say goodbye\n\n\n\n\n            Wendy Heipt, senior reproductive health and justice counsel at Legal Voice, an advocacy group representing the plaintiffs, said Idaho\u2019s law prohibits \u201crecruiting or harboring a minor, but what constitutes recruiting? Giving information? You can\u2019t stop [my clients] from providing information about conduct that is legal in another state.\u201d\n    \n\n            She added, \u201cIf we want to give money to a minor to go to another state, we should be able to do that.\u201d\n    \n\n            In a statement, Idaho\u2019s Office of the Attorney General said, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t comment on pending litigation, our office is always prepared to vigorously defend the constitutionality of statutes duly passed by the legislature.\u201d\n    \n\n            Legal experts say the ban, based on a model bill written by National Right to Life, one of the country\u2019s largest anti-abortion groups, is drafted to sidestep implied constitutional protections for interstate travel.\n    \n\n            \u201cThis National Right to Life proposal was designed to chip away at travel in a way that is less politically and legally risky,\u201d said\u00a0Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at the University of California-Davis and an abortion historian. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to package this as a Republican parental rights initiative, and it\u2019s easier legally because courts have been willing to countenance limits on minor rights that they wouldn\u2019t countenance on adults.\u201d\n    \n\n            She added, \u201cThe idea is to stop people from traveling to other states,\u201d and teen travel bans \u201ccould be a steppingstone to limit an adult\u2019s right to travel.\u201d\n    \n\n            The plaintiffs include the Indigenous Idaho Alliance, a nonprofit that has helped pregnant minors access abortion care outside the state; the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, which provided financial assistance to 166 Idahoans in 2022, including 18 minors; and Lourdes Matsumoto, an attorney who works with victims of domestic and sexual violence, many of whom are minors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Illustration: Jason Lancaster/CNN/Adobe Stock/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nA 45-year-old got pregnant in a state with a ban on abortions. She flew across the country to get one\n\n\n\n\n            Domestic violence advocates \u201cdon\u2019t know what advice they can give people,\u201d Matsumoto said. \u201cIn the shelters, they are confused about what information they can and cannot give out without putting themselves in legal jeopardy.\u201d She said the teen travel ban has had a chilling effect on her work with teenagers dealing with the trauma of sexual assault.\n    \n\n            Idaho\u2019s law, the first in the nation to describe \u201cabortion trafficking,\u201d requires a minimum two-year prison sentence for any adult who acts \u201cwith the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor.\u201d\n    \n\n            But Matsumoto, who has two teenage nieces, said the law fails to detail what constitutes parental consent. \u201cIf my niece comes to me and says, \u2018My mom says this is OK; can you take me to Oregon?\u2019 \u2014 is that enough that the mom consented? Am I going to have to come back, get arrested, lose my law license, then go to court and say, \u2018The mom said it\u2019s OK\u2019? Is it a nod? A thumbs-up in a text message?\u201d\n    \n\n            Courts are usually suspicious of laws that are overbroad and vague, said\u00a0I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor. But he said abortion bans around the country, including Idaho\u2019s teen travel ban, have been written in a \u201cfuzzy\u201d way so that they \u201cwill deter ever more conduct because people don\u2019t know where the line is.\u201d\n    \n\n            The lawsuit cites a legal opinion dated March 27 from Labrador that \u201cstated that medical professionals who refer pregnant patients across state lines for either medical or chemical abortions violate Idaho\u2019s Total Abortion Ban,\u201d a separate law that went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last year in\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Labrador\u00a0withdrew the opinion\u00a0on April 7, facing a legal challenge over constitutional rights of speech and movement.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt is unconstitutional to forbid citizens from traveling because you disapprove of the reasons they are driving to another state,\u201d Heipt said. \u201cIdahoans, like all people, should be free to travel within and between states without the specter of prison, even if they are traveling for a reason other people disagree with.\u201d\n    \n\n            Idaho patients, including teenagers, have long crossed into Washington state to legally end their pregnancies. But fewer than 5% of patients at Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington who come for abortion care are minors, according to Karl Eastlund, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho.\n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n  \n\n\n\n\n            Most of those patients, he said, do involve their parents in the process, even though parental consent is not mandatory in Washington. Those who don\u2019t, Eastlund said, have good reason not to. Some are in dangerous, abusive situations in which disclosing a pregnancy could put them at risk of further harm.\n    \n\n            The lawsuit in Idaho cites Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s concurring opinion in\u00a0Dobbs,\u00a0in which he claimed states could not bar residents from going to other states for abortions.\n    \n\n            \u201cMay a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion?\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cIn my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel.\u201d\n    \n\n            But Kavanaugh represents only one vote on the court, Cohen said, and \u201cit remains to be seen what the other justices have to say on the matter.\u201d\n    \n\n            Rather than settle the question of whether states can prohibit traveling for an abortion, Heipt said, \u201cDobbs\u00a0unleashed chaos.
