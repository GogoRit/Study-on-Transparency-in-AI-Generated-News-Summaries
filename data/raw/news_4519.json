Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that affirmed access to safe and legal abortion.\u201cShe has been an active and vocal threat to abortion rights and reproductive health care,\u201d said Leahy of Springfield. \u201cShe has cited the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision by the Supreme Court as an example of where the court failed to overrule an erroneous decision, in that she was meaning Roe v. Wade.\u201cShe clearly has a record that she believes that issues around abortion need to be reconsidered and she is open to reversing decisions that have been made already.\u201dLeahy said there could be a scenario where Roe v. Wade is left in name only, but the court says \u201cthat you have much more latitude in restricting abortion than it has ever said before which in practice would result in abortion not being accessible.\u201dPresident Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit drew reaction from other officials around Illinois along partisan lines.U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Peoria, said Barrett\u2019s Midwest common sense and record as a circuit judge \u201cexhibited a deep intellectual understanding of the law and commitment to the Constitution. I hope the Senate acts quickly to confirm her and I have every confidence that Judge Barrett will continue to serve our nation faithfully on the Supreme Court.\u201dU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., called the nomination \u201ca transparent grab for power.\u201dIf Republicans insisted on confirming Barrett, Duckworth added, \u201cthe Court could roll back women\u2019s reproductive rights, green light more dark money in politics, jeopardize voting rights and civil rights for Black and brown communities and knock down any progress on climate action.\u201dTim Schneider, chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, called Barrett \u201ca remarkable woman\u201d and urged the Senate to quickly confirm her nomination.\u201cAmy Coney Barrett is brilliant with a jurisprudence faithful to our constitution and American values,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cI can't think of a better person to carry on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's inspiring legal work on behalf of progress and equality for women.\u201dBefore becoming a judge in 2017, the New Orleans native was the Diane and M.O. Miller, II Research Chair in Law and Professor of Law at Notre Dame Law School, where her scholarship focused on constitutional and statutory interpretation and the federal courts.Barrett, 48, is a magna cum laude graduate of Rhodes College in Tennessee and a summa cum laude graduate of Notre Dame Law School.Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings are set to begin Oct. 12.U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said it was clear that Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, wanted to rush Barrett\u2019s nomination through the Senate before the Nov. 3 election and a Nov. 10 Supreme Court hearing on the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake with this nomination is the fate of affordable, quality health care and pre-existing conditions protections for millions of Americans,\u201d Durbin said.With Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges, that gave couples of the same sex the right to marry, \u201cthe genie is out of the bottle,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough power on heaven and earth to put it back in, but they can certainly make life for us miserable trying.\u201dThe Rev. John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame, said Barrett had an \u201cimpressive intellect, character and temperament.\"She is a person of the utmost integrity who, as a jurist, acts first and foremost in accordance with the law,\u201c Jenkins said in a statement.Springfield Bishop Thomas John Paprocki, a civil and canon lawyer, has been a member of the adjunct faculty at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Law School since 2016.\u201cI congratulate my colleague Amy Coney Barrett on her nomination to serve as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d Paprocki said in a statement issued by the diocese Monday. \u201cI pray that this confirmation process may go peacefully, respectfully and successfully for her and her family as well as for our nation.\u201dContact Steven Spearie at 622-1788, sspearie@sj-r.com or twitter.com/stevenspearie.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide My Print Account Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.sj-r.com.
