Photo: teleSUR / Clayton Conn.\n\u00a0\nBy ICRW\u2019s Director of Policy & Advocacy Lyric Thompson and The Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s Director of Policy Sundaa Bridgett-Jones, as originally published on The Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s blog on January 16, 2020\nMexico became the latest country to launch a distinctly\u00a0\u201cfeminist\u201d foreign policy, an approach to foreign relations aimed at advancing gender equality, promoting peace and combatting the most egregious challenges of our day: climate change, gender-based violence, migration. This approach is new and bold \u2014with only five countries that have announced feminist foreign policies\u2014but we believe it holds considerable promise as a tool to organize and catalyze action on the most important issues of the day.\nIt\u2019s a watershed year for actions like this. 2020 is a year of anniversaries, including the fast approaching \u00a025th\u00a0anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the result of\u00a0the Fourth World Conference on Women, wherein world leaders and thousands of women\u2019s rights activists gathered to debate and ultimately enshrine women\u2019s rights as human rights in international law. This marked a fundamental shift from the rights of women being treated as a niche issue to a broader recognition of those rights as fundamental to the overall success of society.\n\nThe Beijing Conference had special significance for U.S. foreign policy. Then\u00a0First Lady Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech was a major moment for the\u00a0United States, as it ultimately set in motion a number of efforts to elevate and codify a focus on gender equality and women\u2019s human rights in U.S. foreign policy and practice.\nThis year, we also celebrate the 20th\u00a0anniversary of the\u00a0United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR 1325)\u00a0on Women, Peace, and Security, which was adopted to protect, involve, and elevate women in conflict and peacetime operations. UNSCR 1325 was the first major and binding mandate to assert the protection of women from violence associated with conflict and champion their meaningful roles in conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts. The resolution has since been\u00a0adopted in national law by 83 countries, including the United States.\nUNSCR 1325 and the Beijing Declaration were major policy innovations in their time and set the frame for numerous ensuing national and global level policy precedents in the decades following their launch. As the world prepares to mark these important moments with\u00a0events throughout the year, we\u2019re considering how to honor the legacy of these pivotal policies with sustainable action.\nAfter more than a year of our own careful\u00a0research and consultation on this question, decades of advocacy driving global feminist movements and the 2014 debut of Sweden\u2019s first of its kind policy, feminist foreign policy presents an important pathway for enshrining rights and enabling sorely needed progress both on our past commitments and those we couldn\u2019t have anticipated at the time, like climate change.\nRecently, ICRW and The Rockefeller Foundation convened leading thinkers in feminist foreign policy from civil society and governments, including those that have announced feminist foreign policies \u2014 Sweden, Canada, France, and now Mexico[1]\u00a0\u2014 in an attempt to distill a common definition and approach. What is feminist foreign policy and how can it enable real and lasting change in line with women\u2019s human rights and gender equality standards. These are the very questions we seek to answer.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFeminist foreign policy presents an important pathway for enshrining rights and enabling sorely needed progress both on our past commitments and those we couldn\u2019t have anticipated \u2026 like climate change. \n\n\n \n\nThe result is an emerging framework for feminist foreign policy to be launched at the upcoming\u00a0United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This framework will provide activists inside and outside of government with the tools they need to push for bold commitments to advance gender equality and women\u2019s human rights. That means everything from more women in senior leadership positions in government\u2014a common indicator of the extent to which an institution is seeking to challenge patriarchal culture\u2014to investing more budget dollars in programs that will advance gender equality and support women and other marginalized populations.\nIt means full-throated support for even the most difficult or contested rights, such as sexual and reproductive rights, as well as increasing investment in peace and environmental integrity. It means calling on governments to \u201c[prioritize] gender equality\u00a0and environmental integrity, [enshrine] the human rights of all, [seek] to disrupt colonial, racist, patriarchal and male-dominated power structures, and [allocate] significant resources, including research, to achieve that vision.\u201d And it means that we must set goals, establish benchmarks, and hold our governments and ourselves accountable. The time for paying more than lip service to feminist ideals in foreign policy is now.\n\n[1]\u00a0Luxembourg has also announced that a feminist foreign policy is currently under development\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT\nview all\n\n\n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\n03/05/2020\nFeminist Foreign Policy: A Framework\nAs the world marks the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a growing number of feminists inside and outside of government are pioneering new approaches to\u2026 \n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\n04/23/2020\nGirls Not Brides USA: COVID-19 and ADOLESCENT GIRLS\nThe scale of the COVID-19 pandemic in many developing countries and fragile and conflict-affected contexts is still unclear, but we can expect \u2014and indeed are already seeing\u2014 significant impacts for\u2026 \n\nRectangle Copy 35\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\n05/12/2021\nIntegrating Gender in U.S. Trade Policy is the Smart Thing to Do\nThough there has been an increase in acknowledgement of the importance of gender in trade, in most cases gender is not integrated in trade policy or agreements, or if it\u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport ICRW is leading the charge in reducing inequality and poverty by generating actionable, evidence-based research.
