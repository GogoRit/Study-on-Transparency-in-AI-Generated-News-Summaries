Europeans forced a male-controlled system of government and society (known as patriarchy) on Indigenous societies. The 1876 Indian Act\tdisadvantaged certain Indigenous women by excluding them from band council government and enforcing discriminatory measures that took away Indian Status rights. Many Indigenous women today are leading the way in the area of healing the wounds of colonization, as they grapple with the issues of\r\n\tresidential schools, missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, abuse\r\n\tand violence, and drug, alcohol and other addictions. (See also Indigenous Feminisms in Canada.)\n\n\n\nCommon Concerns\nDespite differences among First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit\tcommunities, Indigenous women have some common concerns with the Indigenous population as a whole, many of which stem from European colonization.\r\n\tIn addition to the loss of their territories in the 19th century, Indigenous people also lost their traditional livelihood and self-sufficiency. Moreover, social, economic\r\n\tand political marginalization, as well as racial stereotyping, discrimination, and the loss of culture, language\tand often pride, left Indigenous people in Canada with little social or political power. This contributed to economic inequality and even poverty. Urban and rural Indigenous communities continue to struggle with a lack of education,\r\n\temployment, skills, opportunities and income equity. (See also  Economic Conditions of Indigenous Peoples in Canada and Social Conditions of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.)\nDemographic Characteristics\nAccording to the 2016 census, Indigenous people make up 4.9 per cent of the total\r\n\tpopulation of Canada. The Indigenous population is growing rapidly, with a 45 per cent increase between 1996 and 2006. In 2016, Statistics Canada reported the population\r\n\thas increased 42.5 per cent since 2006. (See also Demography of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.)\nAlthough mortality rates have improved over the last two decades, life expectancy for Indigenous people is less than that of the overall Canadian population. Indigenous people also continue to suffer a higher infant mortality rate. Indigenous mortality\r\n\tand fertility rates show a slow trend toward convergence with the Canadian rates. (See also Health of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.)\nMore young Indigenous women migrate to urban centres than do men, especially from small northern communities. This migration may be caused by the lack of opportunities for advancement on reserves\tand in rural areas as well as the perceived abundance of opportunities, particularly education, in urban centres. Studies also show that many of these young women are single parents. (See also Urban Migration of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.)\nPoverty, single parenthood, unemployment and poor housing continue to affect Indigenous women in Canada. These concerns are often more acute in the North, where rural, isolated communities\r\n\tof Inuit,\r\n\tM\u00e9tis and\r\n\tFirst Nations people generally suffer higher rates of illness and have fewer services for the well-being and protection of women and children.\nWomen and the Indian Act\nThe Indian Act is federal legislation that pertains to First Nations\tpeople. (Inuit and M\u00e9tis do not fall under the Act.) Until 1985, the Indian Act took away the rights\r\n\tof women with Indian Status if they married someone without status. Bill C-31 changed the Act in that year by bringing it in line with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\r\n\tThe 1985 amendment allows women who \"married out\" \u2014 and those who lost their Indian Status by other means \u2014 to apply for the restoration of their status and rights. Bill C-31 also allows their children to apply for registration as Status Indians. The\r\n\tAct no longer requires or allows women to follow their husbands into or out of status.\nSince the amendments to the Indian Act in 1985, the number of registered Indians has more than doubled, from approximately 360,000 in 1985 to more than 778,000 in 2007. The\r\n\tincrease is a result of more births over deaths as well as through \"reinstated\" Indian Status.\nHowever, while the amendment addressed discrimination against women, it also created some problems. By placing these women, and often their children, onto First\r\n\tNations band membership lists, the government stretched already limited lands and funds to serve more people. This has, at times, caused resentment and backlash toward these people by\r\n\tFirst Nations members.\nFurther, Bill C-31 created two categories of Indian registration that have had consequences on the number of people entitled to Status Rights. The first, known as sub-section 6(1),\r\n\tapplies when both parents are or were entitled to registration. The second, known as sub-section 6(2), applies when one parent is entitled to registration under 6(1). Status cannot be transferred if that one parent is registered under sub-section\r\n\t6(2). In short, after two generations of intermarriage with non-status partners, children would no longer be eligible for status. This is known as the \u201cSecond-Generation Cut-Off\u201d rule. The amendment therefore significantly limits the ability to transfer\r\n\tstatus to one\u2019s children.\nMany Indigenous peoples have brought cases against the Indian Act to Canadian courts, including the Bedard case (1971), Lavell case\t(1973), McIvor case (2007) and Descheneaux case (2015). In 2017, Parliament passed Bill S-3, an Act to eliminate sex-based inequities in Indian registration.\nStereotypes, Violence and the Justice System\nIndigenous women have confronted unique problems stemming from stereotypes of them perpetuated by non-Indigenous men since contact. The image of the \u201cIndian princess\u201d gave way\r\n\tto that of the promiscuous \"squaw\" which rendered Indigenous women vulnerable to violence and mistreatment. Early observations and oral history indicate that widespread violence accompanied the colonization\tof North America. The removal of Indigenous people from their land, their placement on reserves\tand the loss of the traditional male roles of hunter-provider have caused role conflicts, frustration and anger which often finds its outlet in violence against women.\nThe cycle of violence, combined with the poverty and deprivation facing many Indigenous people in Canada, is connected to a higher rate of incidents involving the law than the general population. Simple failure to pay fines accounts for many incarcerations.\r\n\tLack of resources and few choices often result in limited recourse for Indigenous women. (See also Indigenous Peoples in Canadian Law.)\nHigh rates of domestic violence afflict Indigenous women throughout North America. The Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (1990) noted that one in three Indigenous women suffered abuse at the hands of her partner. The findings from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples\t(1996) supported the view that the constant challenges to the culture and collective identity of Indigenous people weakened the communities and contributed to group and individual alienation that led some to self-destruction and anti-social behaviour.\r\n\tIn 2014, Indigenous women were nearly three times as likely to report being a victim of spousal violence as non-Indigenous women.\nMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\n\n\nAlthough Indigenous women make up about 4 per cent of the female Canadian population, they are significantly overrepresented among missing and murdered women.\r\n\t(\r\n\tSee also Highway of Tears.)\nThe issue gained increased awareness and attention after Amnesty International published Stolen Sisters: A Human Rights Response to Violence and Discrimination against Indigenous Women in Canada (2004) and No More Stolen Sisters (2009).\r\n\tResearch conducted by the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) established a database of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\r\n\tIn 2011, the NWAC database included 582 known cases, most of which had occurred between 1990 and 2010.\nIn 2013, the RCMP launched an investigation into the problem of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. The report (published in 2014) revealed that\r\n\tfrom 1980 to 2012, a total of 1,181 Indigenous women were murdered or were considered missing. As of September 2013, 164 Indigenous women were considered missing, 11.3 per cent of all missing women in Canada. As Indigenous women comprise 4 per cent of\r\n\tthe entire female population in Canada, this number is disproportionately high. More striking was the revelation that 1,017 Indigenous women had been murdered in this period \u2014 16 per cent of the total for all women homicides\tin Canada.\nIn the wake of the RCMP report, calls for a national inquiry into the problem increased. However, the federal government only launched a national public inquiry on 8 December\r\n\t2015.\r\n\nThe National Inquiry\u2019s final report was completed and presented to the public on 3 June 2019. It declared violence against Indigenous women and girls \u201ca national tragedy of epic proportion.\u201d The commissioners called for a new era in relations between\r\n\tIndigenous women, girls, LBGTQ+ (see also Two Spirit) and\r\n\tthe Canadian people \u2014 a relationship centred on the empowerment of Indigenous women and girls. (See also Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada.)\nSterilization of Indigenous Women\nSterilization has been imposed on Indigenous women in Canada. Sexual sterilization legislation was passed in Alberta (1928\u201372) and British Columbia (1933\u201373), and increasingly targeted Indigenous women. Coerced sterilization of Indigenous women took place\r\n\tboth within and outside existing legislation, and in federally operated Indian\r\nhospitals. The practice has continued into the 21st century. Approximately 100 Indigenous women have alleged that they were pressured to consent to sterilization between the 1970s and 2018, often while in the vulnerable state of pregnancy or childbirth.\r\n\t(\r\n\tSee also Sterilization\r\nof Indigenous Women in Canada.)\nIndigenous Women and Politics\nWhile many Indigenous women share goals for the advancement of their people, their voices are often ignored by the Indigenous leadership and male-dominated political organizations. During the Canadian Constitution\ttalks of 1992, the independent national Native Women's Association of Canada was not granted a seat to take part in the talks with the federal government,\r\n\tprovincial premiers and the four major Indigenous organizations.\nOther Indigenous women's organizations formed as dependent adjuncts to the national and regional bodies including the M\u00e9tis National Council of Women (now Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation) and the Saskatchewan Indian Women\u2019s Association (now the Saskatchewan\r\n\tFirst Nations\u2019 Women\u2019s Commission). There are many small grassroots-oriented regional and local women's groups which receive little funding and therefore have difficulty operating in and serving Indigenous communities.\nIn 2012, there were 111 women chiefs out of 633 First Nations across Canada. Although the percentage of\r\n\tfemale Indigenous chiefs in 2012 was only 17.5 per cent, this was slightly higher than the percentage of female mayors of Canadian cities. Some of the earliest high-profile Indigenous women include: Rosemarie Kuptana,\r\n\tpresident of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Mary Simon of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, and Wendy Grant-John, the first woman to be elected Assembly of First Nations\tRegional Chief for British Columbia.\nWomen in Leadership Roles\nA growing number of Indigenous women have held leadership roles in regional and national political organizations. Nellie Cournoyea, a Northwest Territories\tMLA, became the first female premier of a Canadian territory (1991\u201395), and Ethel Blondin-Andrew\twas a Member of Parliament until 2006. Elected as a Conservative MP for Nunavut\tin 2008, Leona Aglukkaq became the first Inuk to be sworn into the Federal Cabinet when she was appointed Minister of Health. Aglukkaq stepped down from that post in 2012 to become\r\n\tthe Chair of the (eight-nation) Arctic Council. Shelly Glover, a Manitoba M\u00e9tis, was first elected in 2008\r\n\tto represent Saint Boniface as an MP, and is the first policewoman in Canadian Parliamentary history. In 2013, she was appointed Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages.\r\n\tIn 2019, Mumilaaq Qaqqaq, Inuk Member of Parliament, became, at age 25, Nunavut\u2019s youngest MP in history, and the first from the New Democratic Party\t(NDP) since Nunavut became a territory in 1999.\nAdditionally, many Indigenous women today are leading the way in the area of healing the wounds of colonization, as they grapple with the issues of residential schools,\r\n\tmissing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, abuse and violence, and drug, alcohol and other addictions.
