The Ministry of Family, Women, and Human Rights has also announced it will create a hotline for medical personnel that could be used to report women and girls whom they suspect had an illegal abortion.\n\u201cInstead of ensuring that rape survivors have access to legal abortion, the government is adopting policies that could discourage women and girls from seeking support and medical care after sexual violence,\u201d said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, acting deputy Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cBrazilian authorities should urgently revoke these new regulations, which increase the risk that women and girls will resort to unsafe abortions that could endanger their lives and health.\u201d\nMedia reported that Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said at a September 17 closed-door meeting with senators that he is willing to change some articles in the regulation. He should revoke it all, Human Rights Watch said.\nThe Supreme Court could temporarily suspend the regulation and then revoke it, in response to two petitions it is scheduled to examine on September 25. The federal Public Defender\u2019s Office and 11 state Public Defender\u2019s Offices have also asked a federal court in S\u00e3o Paulo to revoke the regulation. Brazil\u2019s Congress could approve one of several bills introduced to revoke the regulation.\nThe new regulation orders doctors and other health professionals to collect evidence and report to the police when a woman seeks to terminate a pregnancy that is the consequence of sexual violence. The regulation maintains a previous requirement for medical personnel to question women and girls to obtain a detailed account of the type and form of violence they suffered and, when possible, to identify witnesses and describe the rapist.\nThe regulation says the information should be treated as \u201cconfidential,\u201d but at the same time, it requires medical personnel to hand over that supposedly confidential information to the police, Human Rights Watch said. Medical personnel would have to report all rape cases to the police, without asking for the survivors\u2019 consent.\nIt also requires doctors to offer rape survivors who seek a legal abortion to see the fetus through an ultrasound exam. Given the emotional distress that even receiving such an offer, let alone seeing the fetus, can cause rape survivors, the requirement seems designed to dissuade them from having a legal abortion and to delay their care, Human Rights Watch said.\nThe \u00a0regulation maintains a requirement for rape survivors seeking a legal abortion to \u00a0sign a statement of responsibility with an \u201cexpress warning\u201d that if it \u201cdoes not correspond to the truth\u201d they could be prosecuted for fraud and illegal abortion, punishable with up to five and three years in prison, respectively.\nAbortion is legal in Brazil in cases of rape, when necessary to save a woman\u2019s life, or when the fetus has anencephaly\u2013a condition that makes it difficult for the fetus to survive. To have a legal abortion, a woman or girl needs approval from a doctor and at least three members of a multi-disciplinary team\u2013made up of an obstetrician, anesthetist, nurse, social worker and/or psychologist. \u00a0\nHuman Rights Watch has repeatedly urged the authorities \u00a0to expand access to safe and legal abortion in Brazil, saying that the country\u2019s harsh abortion restrictions are incompatible with its obligations under international human rights law. The new regulations, by making access to legal abortion even more difficult, further threatens the rights to life, health, privacy and medical confidentiality, nondiscrimination, and to be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\nIn a country of \u00a0210 million people, only 42 hospitals are performing legal abortions during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a study by the nonprofit group Article 19 and the news websites AzMina and G\u00eanero e N\u00famero. In 2019, it was 76 hospitals.\nLack of access to a hospital that performs legal abortions, denials of access to legal abortion at those hospitals, stigma, and fear of criminal prosecution can push women and girls who would have a right to a legal abortion \u2013 and those whose pregnancies fall outside the narrow exceptions included in Brazilian law and regulations \u2013 to have potentially life-threatening illegal abortions. Those factors can also keep them from seeking post-abortion care when they experience complications from unsafe procedures or miscarriages.\nAn estimated\u00a0one in five women in Brazil\u00a0has had an abortion by age 40 \u2013 the overwhelming majority outside the health system. Every year, an estimated 200 women die from complications from unsafe abortions, according to the Health Ministry.\nWomen, Family, and Human Rights Minister \u00a0Damares Alves announced the new hotline for medical personnel to report \u201cviolations of human rights\u201d on July 13. A director at the ministry told Human Rights Watch that while the hotline, which is not yet operational, is intended for reporting violence against children, medical personnel could also report suspected illegal abortions.\nThe ministry should ensure that the hotline does not become a means for medical personnel to report women they suspect had an unsafe and illegal abortion, Human Rights Watch said.\nIn Rio de Janeiro, health personnel reports to police led to almost a third of all prosecutions of women for illegal abortion between 2005 and 2017, according to the Rio Public Defender\u2019s Office.\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, and Minister Alves\u00a0frequently speak against sexual and reproductive rights. In June, Minister Pazuello removed two public servants after President Bolsonaro misrepresented a technical note they had signed as a proposal meant \u201cto legalize abortion.\u201d The note did not advocate changing Brazil\u2019s abortion laws but called for maintaining sexual and reproductive health services during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as services for victims of sexual violence and access to contraception and to \u201csafe abortion in the cases contemplated by Brazilian law.\u201d\nThe new regulation will also compound the problem of gender-based violence by intimidating rape survivors and limiting their access to health services, Human Rights Watch said.\n\u201cForcing doctors to act as criminal investigators does not address Brazil\u2019s failure to adequately enforce laws to prevent, prosecute and punish gender-based violence,\u201d Taraciuk Broner said. \u201cInstead, it creates an additional risk of trauma for rape survivors, compromises medical confidentiality and is one more barrier to accessing lawful abortion services.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nBrazil \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nChildren's Rights Women's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nArgentina: Legalize Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 26, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThe Air is Unbearable\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Became Scared, This Was Their Goal\u201d\n\n\nEfforts to Ban Gender and Sexuality Education in Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 12, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nNeglected and Unprotected\n\n\nThe Impact of the Zika Outbreak on Women and Girls in Northeastern Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nArgentina: Legalize Abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 26, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThe Air is Unbearable\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
