(AP) \u2014 Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear on Thursday denounced a Kentucky law designed to impose a near-total ban on abortions as \u201cextremist,\u201d pointing to the lack of exceptions for rape and incest victims as he pushed back on an issue that Republicans have made a policymaking priority.Beshear plunged into the debate after a state judge temporarily suspended enforcement of the state\u2019s so-called trigger law. The 2019 measure took effect \u2014 halting abortions in Kentucky \u2014 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last Friday to end federal constitutional protections for abortions.The ruling by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Mitch Perry on Thursday allowed abortions to resume in Kentucky. There are two abortion clinics in Kentucky \u2014 both in Louisville, the state\u2019s largest city. Beshear, who faces a tough reelection campaign next year, was asked repeatedly about the now-blocked trigger law during his weekly news conference. Several Republicans already running for governor are playing up their opposition to abortion. Beshear supports abortion rights but with \u201creasonable restrictions,\u201d which he\u2019s previously said would apply to late-term abortion procedures.\n\nThe governor\u2019s criticism of the trigger law was aimed at what\u2019s missing from the measure.\n\u201cThe trigger law is an extremist law that the vast majority of Kentuckians disagree with,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides zero exceptions for victims of rape and incest, giving them no options despite the fact that they have been harmed and what they\u2019re going through is ... absolutely zero fault of their own.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trigger law was enacted when Beshear was the state\u2019s attorney general.Kentucky\u2019s current attorney general, Republican Daniel Cameron, is defending the trigger law in court. He said the ruling temporarily blocking the measure had no basis in the state constitution. Later Thursday, Cameron asked the state Court of Appeals to block the lower court ruling that suspended the trigger law and another Kentucky law that attempted to prevent abortions at six weeks of pregnancy. That measure was previously halted by a federal court.\n\nCameron is among the Republicans vying to challenge Beshear in the 2023 election.\u201cWe will do everything possible to continue defending this law and to ensure that unborn life is protected in the commonwealth,\u201d Cameron said in a statement.State GOP spokesperson Sean Southard noted Thursday that some Democrats in the Republican-dominated legislature voted for the trigger law. He asked whether Beshear thinks those Democrats are \u201cso-called extremists.\u201dBeshear said that during his tenure as attorney general, he encountered rape and incest cases involving girls. Under the trigger law, they would have \u201czero options and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said.\u201cRight\u2019s right and wrong\u2019s wrong, no matter who voted what way,\u201d the governor said.In comments directed at his Republican critics, the governor added: \u201cDo they believe that it\u2019s not extremist to remove every option from rape and incest victims? Will they look them in the eye and tell them that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
