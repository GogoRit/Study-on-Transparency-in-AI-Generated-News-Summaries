She had been planning to attend college this fall, the first in her family.\nThen came COVID-19 and she found herself caring for her ailing grandmother and setting up a K-5 classroom in the family\u2019s trailer for her siblings. She had to quit her job for college money at Dollar General.\n\u201cI thought I had it all figured out for the first time in my life and then all of this stuff started happening,\u201d the 17-year-old recently told us. \u201cI just want to be happy \u2026 to go to school and go back to my job.\u201d\nThe pandemic has exposed systemic inequalities and structural racism. It has taken a disproportionate toll on Black people, especially in the rural South, where limited access to medical care and high poverty rates lead to some of the country\u2019s worst health outcomes.\nBeing out of school for months on end, young people \u2014 especially in areas without reliable internet or phone services \u2014 are cut off from friends, teachers, and school communities. Many struggle with isolation and loneliness. They missed out on milestones, such as class trips and graduations; they fear for their health as they return to classrooms.\nMany, like the young woman we spoke with, have taken on caregiver responsibilities. They struggle as jobs and working hours are cut and small businesses close.\nIn June, we joined almost 100 young Black women and girls from Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi at the virtual gathering for the 15th annual Unita Blackwell Young Women\u2019s Leadership Institute, a program of the Southern Rural Black Women\u2019s Initiative. The young women described the pandemic\u2019s effect on their health and lives.\nThe pandemic is creating new hardships for already overburdened healthcare systems. In the rural South, hospitals in communities that already have restricted services are closing or reducing care at alarming rates.\nThese young women reinforced key human rights concerns about transportation, limited access to healthcare providers and insurance, and general distrust of the healthcare system that Human Rights Watch has found in our own research.\nThe pandemic is not only exacerbating many of these existing health barriers, but it\u2019s also underscoring government failures to protect everyone\u2019s fundamental human rights. Instead, structural racism, discrimination, and poverty\u2014which have historically left Black people out of the healthcare system \u2014 are leaving leave us more vulnerable to a serious and deadly virus.\nBut the pandemic is also showing that knowledge is power.\nIn a recent report, Human Rights Watch found that Alabama \u201cis failing to educate young people about their sexual and reproductive health,\u201d despite the impact it could have \u201con ensuring positive health outcomes into adulthood.\u201d\nThe young woman from Bolivar County still plans to attend college.\nOur youth are powerful and resilient. They will drive the change to dismantle racism and oppression. Our future as a country depends on their success. We need to invest in our young people\u2019s growth, leadership, and health \u2014 during this pandemic and beyond.\nAmanda Furdge is the youth program coordinator with the Children\u2019s Defense Fund-Southern Regional Office and director of the Unita Blackwell Young Women\u2019s Leadership Institute with the Southern Rural Black Women\u2019s Initiative for Social and Economic Justice.
