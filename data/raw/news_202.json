One of the measures requires a woman to undergo an ultrasound at least 18 hours before an abortion and the second requires parents of minors to be given notice of a court-authorized abortion.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Supreme Court wary of restricting government contact with social media firms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alito extends order pausing new Texas immigration law for now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Supreme Court to hear case involving government pressure to remove social media content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ex-deputy gets 20 years in racist torture of Black men\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Social media influencer charged for her role in Jan. 6 attack\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Supreme Court of the United States\nLouisiana\n\nMelissa Quinn\n\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.
