If DeSantis approves the bill, it would go into effect July 1, 2022.Ginny Beagan, WochitThis week, state\u00a0Rep. Skyler Wheeler of Orange City introduced a bill to forbid anyone in Iowa\u00a0from performing or inducing an abortion or attempting to do so in\u00a0this state. If that were to become law, a woman seeking an abortion would\u00a0have no say and no standing.And, if I'm reading this bill correctly,\u00a0she might be prosecuted for\u00a0trying to end her own pregnancy, which is what some desperate pregnant women did before the Roe v. Wade court ruling.\u00a0Strikingly,\u00a0the wording of Wheeler's bill\u00a0makes no mention of the pregnant woman or girl at the legislation\u2019s center.Of course there's a catch, since the\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roe in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to abortions that\u00a0states can't take away fully. The Iowa Supreme Court has said women have a similar right independently under the state constitution.Those who would cheer the\u00a0Iowa bill, which is a \"trigger law\" like those already passed in\u00a0a dozen other states,\u00a0are counting\u00a0on\u00a0Roe being overturned.More: Mississippi's history of terrorizing Black women continues unabated in abortion ban caseSupreme Court expected to allow more abortion restrictionsAn anticipated U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June, whether or not it formally overturns that precedent, could fundamentally weaken the right to abortions, something Republican Iowa lawmakers have made repeated attempts to do. The\u00a0Mississippi law the court is assessing\u00a0makes abortions illegal after\u00a015 weeks of pregnancy. Wheeler's House File 2289 could also be triggered if\u00a0a constitutional amendment gave states the authority to\u00a0ban abortions.\u00a0The word \"dismissive\" doesn't even do justice to the way some\u00a0Iowa\u00a0lawmakers view\u00a0the women whose bodies they write laws on.\u00a0Wheeler's bill\u00a0\"prohibits\u00a0a person from knowingly performing, inducing, or attempting to perform or induce an abortion,\" which it defines\u00a0as \"the termination of a human pregnancy with the intent other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus.\"\u00a0In earlier times,\u00a0abortion opponents used to at least claim\u00a0they cared about\u00a0women seeking abortions by saying they\u00a0were misinformed or manipulated into not carrying their pregnancies to term. But\u00a0the gloves are off. In this bill, a\u00a0pregnant woman's\u00a0body is just a legal battleground,\u00a0the object of\u00a0lawmakers' dictates. We may as well be talking about collecting gravel from a roadway or removing\u00a0scaffolding from a construction site.A few years ago, Sen. Jake Chapman\u00a0tried\u00a0to pass a bill making abortions\u00a0a\u00a0\"hate crime.\" He's the senator\u00a0who recently\u00a0accused journalists and\u00a0teachers of\u00a0a \"sinister agenda\" to promote pedophilia and incest. Yet his compassion for victims of incest or rape apparently ends if they don't want a\u00a0child to result.\u00a0\u00a0Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2018 signed the nation's toughest anti-abortion law, banning the procedure\u00a0after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.\u00a0It was defeated in state courts. But since then she has\u00a0appointed four new Iowa Supreme Court justices,\u00a0who could reconsider those rulings this spring.\u00a0Some Iowans are also trying to amend Iowa's constitution to say it does not\u00a0recognize a right to abortion or permit public funding of it.\u00a0Wheeler last year proposed a law\u00a0declaring that life begins at conception, a belief he's entitled to as part of his religion, but not one he gets to write into law as fact. Until an embryo or fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb on its own, it cannot\u00a0be considered separately from the woman carrying it.\u00a0That's why\u00a0Roe\u00a0draws the line at fetal viability.More: Editorial: This is not a drill. Abortion rights are in dire danger, and Iowans will have to fight to preserve them.No interest in trying to reduce the need for abortionThis doesn't mean there's nothing abortion opponents can do. They could instead commit to preventing the need for them.\u00a0But Iowa did the opposite when in 2017 it withdrew from a federally funded family planning program with Planned Parenthood, and replaced it with a state-run version. That plan didn\u2019t work, as between\u00a02018 and 2020, abortions statewide rose 42%,\u00a0after having fallen 56% in the previous decade.\u00a0The\u00a0numbers have since\u00a0climbed every year, from 2,849 in 2018 to\u00a03,566 in 2019 to\u00a04,058\u00a0in 2020.Thousands of Iowans had depended on Planned Parenthood for birth control supplies and information and\u00a0sexually transmitted disease-prevention.The group Iowans for Life disputed that Planned Parenthood's removal was responsible for the increases. Activist Maggie DeWitte instead blamed the rise in abortions\u00a0on the\u00a02018 Iowa Supreme Court declaration\u00a0that\u00a0Iowa's constitution incudes a right to abortions.\u00a0\"When you create a fundamental right, that means you can't regulate abortions in any way,\" she told the Register.\u00a0But women don't have abortions\u00a0for fun.\u00a0They might resort to them if they lacked access to birth control.\u00a0Anyone could have predicted this\u00a0outcome, as I\u00a0did at the time, saying the effort was \"bound to fail because with or without Planned Parenthood, as long as there are unwanted pregnancies, there will be a demand for abortions. And as long as there is demand, women \u2014 some poor, some desperate, some underage \u2014 will find ways to get them. And if birth control is less accessible ... there will be more unplanned pregnancies.\"More: My journey from condemning to protecting abortion rightsReynolds and the legislative majority apparently don't care that a\u00a0majority of Iowans believe\u00a0abortions should be legal in most or all cases.\u00a0Nationally, only 30% of Americans would support reversing Roe v. Wade,\u00a0with 69% wanting to keep abortion rights intact.These lawmakers' zeal to outlaw abortions would be more convincing if they\u00a0worked for the welfare of the children Iowa already has rather than just compelling women to birth them.If abortion rights are stripped, pregnant women or girls who aren't emotionally, physically or financially prepared to bear and raise children will still find ways to end their pregnancies.\u00a0They just might\u00a0get harmed or die in the process. But pregnant women and girls\u00a0aren't even considered in this insulting, misogynistic piece of legislation. If for that reason alone, it\u00a0should not advance.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
