CHOICE42 thanked everyone who helped raise awareness of the issue. The pro-life group expressed gratitude for GoFundMe's representative having assisted in resolving the matter.\nA pro-life advocacy organization in Canada says the crowdsourcing site, GoFundMe, is withholding more than $2,700 in donations from three moms in need.\nOn Monday, CHOICE42, the Canadian group led by pro-life advocate Laura Klassen, explained the situation on Facebook:\nWe didn\u2019t want to have to do this, but we have no other options. This is the money GoFundMe is withholding from us. The total amount is over $2,700. This money was raised for three mothers in need and we cannot wait any longer for these funds.\nWe have been waiting since April 17, 2020 to receive the first fundraiser amount and have done everything GoFundMe has asked of us. They are now not responding to our messages.\nPlease share and help us get this money which we fundraised for. Three mothers and their children are depending on it.\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nAccording to Klassen, the need for these funds is urgent.\u00a0\n\u201cThese are time sensitive situations and we were not able to wait,\u201d she told Pregnancy Help News in an email.\u00a0\nKlassen\u2019s group set up the fundraisers when the COVID-19 lockdowns began. One of the fundraisers was successful in helping a new mom to replace a broken washing machine.\nHowever, the three fundraisers CHOICE42 has run since then have been inexplicably stalled.\nThe first fundraiser is for a single mother in Zimbabwe.\u00a0\n\nCHOICE42/Facebook\n\n\u201cWe fundraised for her to be able to deliver in the hospital, and afford the essentials for a newborn,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cShe is all alone with no family support and no money. She has been experiencing labour symptoms and needs to book her hospital room immediately.\u201d\nCHOICE42 supporters raised more than $500 for her, hitting their fundraising goal by April 17. The fundraiser was then flagged by GoFundMe\u2019s security team because the money is destined for Zimbabwe.\u00a0\n\u201cThey wanted to know our action plan for getting the money to this woman which we promptly sent,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cWe went back and forth with them for about a week and then we were told that the money was unlocked. It was not.\u201d\nFunds from the following two fundraisers cannot be accessed either.\u00a0\n\nCHOICE42/Facebook\n\nOne is for a mom in Canada who has faced tremendous setbacks because of government closures made during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is not a Canadian citizen, but Klassen says she has applied for status.\n\u201cWith the quarantine, she does not qualify for any financial help from the government and has no way to get an income at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cShe and her daughter are slipping through the cracks.\u201d\nCHOICE42 fundraised more than $1,500 for the pair\u2014enough to help cover two month\u2019s rent and groceries.\nThe other fundraiser is for a young woman in the U.S. who became pregnant by rape.\u00a0\n\nCHOICE42/Facebook\n\n\u201cShe has no family support,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cShe had been renting an air conditioner which was recently reclaimed as she could no longer afford it. She lives in a small trailer that can get quite hot. She is about to give birth and we wanted to support her in this way.\u201d\nCHOICE42 previously assisted this same mom through an Amazon baby registry, where supporters bought her much-needed items. Through the GoFundMe fundraiser, the group raised nearly $800 for a new AC unit.\nFor these last two fundraisers, Klassen says her group repeatedly received automated messages saying, \u201cWithdrawal failed.\u201d The last time the group heard from a GoFundMe staff person was April 28. When CHOICE42 called the website out on Facebook this week, the group finally received a message from GoFundMe.\nStill, \u201cnothing is resolved and we still don\u2019t have the money,\u201d Klassen said.\nTweet This: Still, \u201cnothing is resolved and we still don\u2019t have the money,\u201d Klassen said of GoFundMe go-round.\nBecause of the stressful situations that these women were facing, one of the CHOICE42 team members ended up fronting the funds to the women. Klassen says that team member happens to be unpaid, unlike the rest of the CHOICE42 team.\nAlong with education, one of CHOICE42\u2019s priorities is supporting women facing unplanned pregnancies.\u00a0\nThe group does so by providing \u201cCanada\u2019s largest nation-wide database of pregnancy help resources\u201d on its website, CHOICE42.com.\u00a0\nAlong with GoFundMe fundraisers, CHOICE42 has supported multiple women through Amazon baby registries, challenging the notion that pro-lifers don\u2019t care about babies after they are born. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nChoice42\ngofundme\nabortion\npregnancy help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Franklin\n\nKatie Franklin is a writer for Heartbeat International.
