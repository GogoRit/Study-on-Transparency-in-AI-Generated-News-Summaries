Tens of thousands of GOP voters made the vote a resounding victory for abortion rights supporters. (Lily O'Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be easy to assume Elaine Gail doesn\u2019t support abortion rights.\nShe\u2019s a lifelong Republican whose parents worked for Republican campaigns in Kansas. She traveled with \u201cDolls for Dole,\u201d a group of costumed young women who sang at campaign stops for the late Sen. Bob Dole, who once supported a Constitutional amendment to ban all abortion, though he later softened his position to allow some exceptions.\nBut at 68, she\u2019s old enough to remember seeing her high school classmates struggle with unplanned pregnancies. One hid her pregnancy to avoid being kicked out of school.\n\u201cShe was wearing the coat all the time to kind of hide it,\u201d said Gail, a retiree who lives in Topeka, \u201cand one of my classmates had this great idea that we would take turns wearing coats to class, too, kind of in solidarity and \u2026 we were hoping to divert suspicion from the teachers.\u201d\nGail graduated high school two years before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision. Watching her friend hide her pregnancy and seeing two other classmates go away to give birth and put their babies up for adoption helped shape her views on abortion.\nShe\u2019s one of tens of thousands of Republicans \u2014 at least 20% of Republicans who turned out in August \u2014\u00a0who voted \u201cno\u201d this summer on an amendment meant to remove the right to an abortion from the Kansas Constitution. Across Kansas, counties where President Donald Trump won by double digits were split on the issue of abortion. \u201cDeep red\u201d Kansas voted 59% to 41% to uphold women\u2019s right to choose, stunning the nation.\n\u201cNo\u201d voters were supportive of keeping abortion rights in the constitution. A \u201cyes\u201d vote was in favor of removing the right.\nMuch of the \u201cno\u201d vote came, of course, from Democrats and vocal supporters of abortion rights. But Democratic ballots alone wouldn\u2019t have been enough to kill the amendment.\u00a0\nTo reach the total number of votes cast against the amendment, at least 91,000 Republicans would have had to vote no. And that\u2019s assuming every Democrat and unaffiliated voter opposed the amendment.\u00a0\nSome did so quietly for fear of alienating loved ones, friends or church communities. Others, like Gail, were more vocally upset with her party. And she plans to cast her vote for Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, in her reelection bid against Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt next month.\nDespite the mandate on abortion rights from Kansas voters this summer, abortion has not been a centerpiece of either candidate\u2019s campaign. Schmidt has been more cautious about abortion. Despite petitioning the Kansas Supreme Court last year to reverse its decision granting a constitutional right to abortion, Schmidt said he would respect voters\u2019 choice following the August vote.\nKelly is running a kitchen table campaign on her administration\u2019s success funding schools, balancing the budget and cutting the state\u2019s sales tax on food.\nWho voted no?\nAbortion rights supporters\u2019 victory in August reflected what Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which campaigned against the amendment, was hearing from voters.\n\u201cFor the most part, the people that we talked to really didn\u2019t see abortion as a partisan or political issue,\u201d said Ashley All, the group\u2019s communications manager. \u201cThey saw it as incredibly complex and deeply personal, and so we intentionally approached it in a nonpartisan way.\u201d\nThat freed the group up to have conversations across the political spectrum, she said. And they heard stories of complicated pregnancies and difficult decisions from voters.\n\u201cMaybe somebody, you know, saw their loved one go through a miscarriage or a really challenging and life-threatening pregnancy,\u201d All said. \u201cAll of those things impact the decisions they make and they impact the way they see abortion and the decisions associated with pregnancy.\u201d\nCat Poland\u2019s journey from a pro-life Catholic kid to a supporter of abortion rights was a long one. Her older brother was arrested during the \u201cSummer of Mercy,\u201d when anti-abortion protestors rallied outside of abortion clinics in Wichita for weeks on end.\u00a0\nThe first blow to her pro-life bonafides came when her brother took his life. Her family would later learn he had been sexually abused by a priest in their parish.\nYears later, Poland said she was driving down the highway and saw a billboard about abortion.\n\u201cIt hit me, I thought, \u2018Where was the march for his life?\u2019\u2009\u201d Poland said. \u201cWhere was this outpouring of passion and political activism and the valuing of his life? Like, the hypocrisy of it just smacked me in the face.\u201d\nThen Poland\u2019s first pregnancy was ectopic, a condition where an embryo attaches to the fallopian tube instead of the wall of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies are never viable, but her doctor\u2019s Catholic hospital system wouldn\u2019t fill a prescription for an abortifacient.\u00a0\n\u201cI had a potentially fatal condition and here this health care provider was lording their spiritual power over me,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nShe had to go to another health system that gave her the wrong dose. Her fallopian tube ruptured and she was forced to go to the hospital in excruciating pain to have it removed.\u00a0\nWhen she looked over her medical records and saw the term \u201cabortion\u201d used to describe the surgery, she said it was difficult to grapple with.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it just made me realize that abortion looks a lot different than what people imagine it to be,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThough Jane Byrnes was a young adult when Roe v. Wade was decided, she didn\u2019t think much about abortion for most of her adult life. It was a settled issue growing up Catholic.\nBut about 10 years ago, she started seeking out other Catholic women as she wrestled with how to talk about abortion. It was a long evolution for her from her Catholic upbringing. She started to realize she didn\u2019t have anything against women who made the decision to terminate a pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t exist in me to judge against them,\u201d Byrnes said.\nShe said she started rethinking her position on abortion as she thought about the abuse and neglect children can receive in foster care or when they\u2019re given up for adoption. A child\u2019s need for care and protection doesn\u2019t end at birth, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the situation,\u201d Byrnes said. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a great deal of difficulty and/or joy.\u201d\nBefore this election cycle, Byrnes hadn\u2019t talked much about abortion. But she appeared in a commercial for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom. All of a sudden, she talked about it constantly.\u00a0\n\u201cThere was a time in my life where I would have been anti-abortion,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t been there for a long time.\u201d\u00a0\nThat complicated mix of upbringing, beliefs and personal experience makes the results of the August vote difficult to interpret, All said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever fully understand why so many people voted no,\u201d All said.\n  Women politicians from Kansas and Missouri celebrated the anniversary of the Greater Kansas City Women\u2019s Political Caucus on Thursday Sept. 22, 2022 (Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)\nAll said she saw a swing after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe in a case called Dobbs v. Jackson in late June, less than six weeks before the Kansas vote.\n\u201cThe big shift that I saw was among moderate Republican women, unaffiliated men and women \u2014 people who believed that the constitutional right to abortion was protected at the federal level,\u201d All said.\nThough she believes the amendment would have failed regardless of the timing of the court decision, All said it was a wakeup call for a lot of people.\nAcross the country, that decision led to a wave of voter registrations, especially by women.\nMary Wehrman said she knocked on 600 doors in Pittsburg and around southeast Kansas in the weeks leading up to the vote. It was women over the age of 65 who surprised her with their support of abortion rights.\n\u201cI had some say, \u2018I had friends, I had sisters who flew to New York to get services, had to get on a plane and fly to New York City\u2019 \u2014 and people that had back alley abortions and that sort of thing,\u201d Wehrman said.\nSusan Osborne, a retired professor in Wichita, said she knew of many people who quietly voted \u201cno\u201d because they belonged to pro-life communities.\n\u201cThey said, well, they didn\u2019t want to make waves but \u2026 they just wanted me to know that they were voting no and that they were really proud of us for what we had done,\u201d Osborne said.\nNancy Kassebaum, Kansas\u2019 first woman senator, lives in Marion County and said she felt people who planned to vote in favor of abortion rights were less vocal.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because it was quietly sort of developing, if you know what I mean,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was not like someone threw a bomb into a barricade. And before you knew it you were realizing there were a lot of people quietly saying they were going to vote no.\u201d\nKassebaum was elected as a Republican in 1978. The night before her announcement, her father, former Kansas Gov. Alf Landon, a Republican who served in the 1930s and ran against Franklin D. Roosevelt for president, asked what she thought the press would ask her about.\u00a0\nShe told him abortion and guns.\n\u201cThere were a long pause, and my father at that point was in his 80s, and he said, \u2018Abortion? Well what business is that of the government?\u2019\u2009\u201d Kassebaum said.\nPivot to fall\nMore than 942,000 Kansans cast ballots in the August constitutional vote, more than have voted in any statewide primary in the last 12 years and nearly as many as voted in the 2018 gubernatorial election, giving candidates a chance to take advantage of once-in-a-generation energy among Kansas voters.\nBut while Wehrman said she still hears concern about abortion as she knocks doors for Kelly, the two candidates\u2019 campaigns for governor haven\u2019t centered the issue.\nKelly said in an interview at a Greater Kansas City Women\u2019s Political Caucus event last month that people know her stance on abortion, but they want her to focus on making Kansas prosperous. Kelly has consistently supported abortion rights since the start of her political career in Kansas. Before running for governor in 2018, she represented Topeka as a state senator for 14 years.\n\u201cI have always focused on the issues that I think are of concern to the majority of Kansas, and so, you know, I\u2019m not going to change now,\u201d Kelly said.\u00a0\nHer campaign declined to have a reporter along for campaign stops last week. But Kelly told CNN that Kansans \u201ctend to elect to the governor\u2019s office a very moderate, commonsense, thoughtful person to run their state and to make sure that the basic services are provided for them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat they want me as governor to do is to focus on the kitchen table issues,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cYou know, they want me to focus on the economy. And we have done that.\u201d\nSchmidt\u2019s campaign spokesman, C.J. Grover, said in a statement that the Republican has said the results of this summer\u2019s vote \u201cmust be respected.\u201d He said the \u201creal question\u201d is whether Kansas\u2019 governor will defend existing abortion restrictions already on the books.\n\u201cSchmidt has committed to defending these laws as governor, just as he has in his time as attorney general,\u201d Grover said.\u00a0\nGrover said Kelly has not promised the same, in part, \u201cbecause the legal challenges will come from her political allies bankrolling her campaign.\u201d\u00a0\nTai Edwards, a historian and member of the leadership team for Women For Kansas, said there\u2019s an ad or button to be made tying Kelly\u2019s opponent, Schmidt, to anti-abortion forces. Schmidt is endorsed by a political action committee associated with Kansans For Life, the state\u2019s leading anti-abortion group.\nKansas Values Institute, which is supporting Kelly, released one mailer with a \u201cDANGER\u201d sign above a photo of Schmidt. It says Schmidt \u201cstill wants to allow politicians to ban abortion with no exceptions for rape, incest or when the life of the woman is at risk.\u201d\nBut Edwards said she could understand the strategy of not centering Kelly\u2019s campaign on abortion if she perceives the issue as less partisan than typically thought.\n\u201cI would like to hear that,\u201d Edwards said, \u201cbut I\u2019m gonna vote for her even if she doesn\u2019t say it. And maybe that\u2019s what she thinks.\u201d\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct Ashley All\u2019s role with Kansans for Constitutional Freedom.

It says Schmidt \u201cstill wants to allow politicians to ban abortion with no exceptions for rape, incest or when the life of the woman is at risk.\u201d\nBut Edwards said she could understand the strategy of not centering Kelly\u2019s campaign on abortion if she perceives the issue as less partisan than typically thought.\n\u201cI would like to hear that,\u201d Edwards said, \u201cbut I\u2019m gonna vote for her even if she doesn\u2019t say it. And maybe that\u2019s what she thinks.\u201d\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct Ashley All\u2019s role with Kansans for Constitutional Freedom.
