You\u2019re not respecting human life in the womb. What makes you think you\u2019ll respect it on the street?\u201d\nSince the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton cases, over 61 million abortions have taken place in the U.S., an average of 2,000 per day.\nGlobally, there are a total of some 73.3 million abortions each year, according to the Guttmacher Institute \u2013 a number at least five million greater than United Kingdom\u2019s current population, and almost 15 million more than the\u00a0United Nation\u2019s 2019 crude death rate, or total number of deaths worldwide in a given year.\nBioethicist Steven Bozza, director of the Office for Life and Family, welcomes guests to the 2016 Pro-Life Summit in Philadelphia. Ahead of the 2022 March for Life, Bozza said abortion ultimately devalues life at every stage. (Sarah Webb)\nAbortion particularly impacts communities of color: Black, Hispanic and other non-White patients accounted for 62% of all U.S. abortions in 2014, according to\u00a0Guttmacher.\nMarching for life\nOn Jan. 22, Bozza will join thousands expected at the 49th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. After last year\u2019s virtual observance due to COVID, the gathering \u2013 launched by Nellie Gray in 1974 to protest the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions \u2013 will resume its in-person format.\nTrips to the march are being organized by some two dozen Philadelphia-area parishes, Catholic schools and Knights of Columbus chapters, with Bozza\u2019s office coordinating bus parking permits for groups traveling to pre-march Masses at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.\nA number of local teens will stay in Washington to attend the Jan. 22 National Pro-Life Summit, hosted by Students for Life of America (SFLA). The all-day session, set to take place at the capital\u2019s Omni Shoreham Hotel, will provide training for grassroots pro-life activists.\n\u201cWe have students signed up from private, public and parochial schools,\u201d said Maria Parker, theology department chair at Cardinal O\u2019Hara High School.\nSFLA has provided Parker with some 80 free tickets to the conference, while support from the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia (PLU) and Pennsylvanians for Human Life is covering the cost of transportation for her group. The participant fee of $250 includes one-night hotel accommodations plus all meals. Interested students from grade nine and up can contact Parker via email for information and registration.\nAhead of the D.C. gatherings, the Chester County Pro-Life Coalition will hold its own March for Life on Sunday, Jan. 16 at 3 p.m. at St. Agnes Parish in West Chester. Speakers will include PLU board member Patrick Stanton; Immaculate Heart of Mary Sister J. Sheila Galligan of Immaculata University\u2019s theology department; and Wendy Burpee of the Genesis Women\u2019s Clinic, which has locations in both Pottstown and Phoenixville. Weather permitting, the indoor program will be followed by a march to the county\u2019s Old Courthouse.\nPrayers for the unborn\nAlong with public demonstrations, prayer remains vital to ending abortion, say pro-life advocates.\nThe PLU will hold a prayer vigil Jan. 22 at 10 am outside Planned Parenthood\u2019s downtown location at 12th and Locust Streets. Both the vigil and the SFLA summit will take place on the Day of Prayer for the Legal Protection of Unborn Children, observed in all the Catholic dioceses of the U.S.\nPro-life advocate Ashley Garecht (second left) joined some 30 others at a Dec. 1, 2021 prayer vigil outside a Philadelphia Planned Parenthood site, an event organized by the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia as the Supreme Court considers a case that could overturn its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. (Gina Christian)\nAs in recent years, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is also inviting faithful across the nation to participate in the 9 Days for Life novena (Jan. 19-27) for the protection of human life.\nWith materials available in both English and Spanish, each day\u2019s novena intention includes a short reflection, suggested acts of reparation and additional resources for understanding church teaching and pastoral outreach regarding abortion.\nThroughout the month of January, a Zoom-based rosary campaign for the end of abortion is being recited each evening at 9 p.m., led by Mickey Kelly, a local pro-life advocate and board president of the St. Raymond Nonnatus Foundation. Those wishing to join the rosary can email Kelly for the Zoom link.\nHeadwinds and hope\nAmid ongoing efforts to end abortion, several challenges remain, say area pro-life leaders.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s pending ruling in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case \u2013 a decision expected by July \u2014 could overturn Roe v. Wade and redirect the abortion issue to the state level for legislation.\nBut that\u2019s where the work begins anew, said Father Christopher Walsh, PLU chairman and pastor of St. Raymond of Pe\u00f1afort Parish in Philadelphia.\n[tower]\nStates such as New Jersey have already moved \u201cto enshrine a \u2018right to abortion\u2019 in their law,\u201d said Father Walsh, noting \u201cthere are plans to do the same in Pennsylvania.\u201d\nFor that reason, \u201cit is essential for people who believe in the civil rights of the unborn child to be united,\u201d he said.\nIn the process of \u201c(fighting) this legal battle,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more challenging battle for hearts and minds must continue.\u201d\nFather Walsh urged compassion in \u201clistening to those who believe abortion is permissible,\u201d and advised pro-life advocates to \u201cshare the truth with (abortion proponents) little by little, with patience but also with conviction.\u201d\nAnd men need to be part of that conversation on abortion, said Bozza.\n\u201cI put much of this issue squarely into the hands of the men involved,\u201d he said, citing Pope Paul VI\u2019s 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae, which warned that artificial contraception and abortion would result in a woman being reduced to \u201ca mere instrument for the satisfaction of (a man\u2019s) desires,\u201d without regard for \u201cthe reverence due to (her)\u201d (Humanae Vitae, 17).\nPLU president and CEO Tom Stevens agreed, describing abortion as \u201can easy way out for men.\u201d\nAt the same time, many men are simply excluded \u201cwhen there\u2019s an unexpected pregnancy,\u201d and a decision to seek an abortion \u201ccan cause great grief for a man,\u201d said Stevens.\nBoth he and Bozza said chemical abortions, the pills for which are now widely available in several states through telemedicine and online delivery services, compound that marginalization \u2013 while endangering the health of women and teen girls.\n\u201cA doctor or a nurse practitioner could be talking to a 14-year-old girl in her bedroom, and there\u2019s no ultrasound, so you don\u2019t really know how far along she is, or if she has an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cIt\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens when things go wrong, and she ends up in the hospital?\u201d asked Bozza, noting that advances in medical science are themselves paving the way to end abortion.\n\u201cWhen women look at ultrasound videos, there\u2019s no mistaking those are children in the womb,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd modern genetics (shows) that what a person is genetically at the moment of conception, they\u2019ll always be; there\u2019s no changing that.\u201d\nThanks to entities such as SFLA and Live Action, younger generations have \u201cthe scientific information\u201d to \u201cdebunk the social myths\u201d surrounding abortion, said Parker.\n\u201cI think most of our students are definitely pro-life, and they just need the knowledge and information so they can connect what they\u2019re feeling in their hearts with their heads,\u201d she said.\nThe wide range of pregnancy and parenting supports provided by archdiocesan Catholic Social Services and the PLU\u2019s numerous member outreaches offer tangible help and hope to women in crisis pregnancies, offering them alternatives to abortion, said pro-life advocates.\n\u201cThe pro-life community of Greater Philadelphia is doing amazing things,\u201d said Father Walsh. \u201cI hope others join these efforts for the good of the human family.\u201d\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
