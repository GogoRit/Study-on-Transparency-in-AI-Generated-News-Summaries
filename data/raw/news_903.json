The report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights, found that medication abortion\u2014a two-pill regimen approved in the U.S. to end pregnancies up to 10 weeks\u2014accounted for 54% of abortions in 2020. This marks a significant jump from 39% in 2017, the last time the report was released. \u201cPeople really like that [medication abortion] removes a lot of the barriers,\u201d says Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to take time off from work and especially for people living on low incomes and people of color, it makes life a lot easier and they\u2019re able to integrate this healthcare into their lives.\u201dBut the increasing availability of abortion pills has put the method in the crosshairs of a national battle over abortion. As progressive groups and the Biden Administration have sought to make them more accessible, Republicans and conservative activists around the country are adding new restrictions. Nineteen states currently ban telemedicine visits for medication abortion, and at least 16 state legislatures have introduced bills this year to ban or limit medication abortion in various ways.Read More: States Push New Abortion Bans, Preempting the Supreme CourtMedication abortion had been growing in popularity before the coronavirus pandemic, but COVID-19 likely made the method more appealing as people sought to minimize medical procedures and trips to health facilities. In 2020, medical associations sued the federal government to lift the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) requirement that the first abortion pill, mifepristone, be dispensed to patients in person. The FDA temporarily removed that requirement last spring and, in December, the Biden Administration made the move permanent. The FDA\u2019s decision allows patients to receive the abortion pills by mail after they have a telemedicine appointment with a provider.Abortion opponents fear that even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, people will be able to end their pregnancies using abortion pills. Anti-abortion groups like Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life of America have made limiting the pills a priority, and are encouraging states to restrict them particularly in light of the FDA\u2019s decision. \u201cWe are trying to really start educating our movement and Christians broadly across the country about what these pills really are, and how just very dangerous they are to women,\u201d Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told TIME earlier this year.Doctors and abortion rights advocates stress that years of research has shown medication abortion is safe. \u201cWe did an analysis of 11,000 medication abortions in California and found that the rate of major adverse events was less than a third of 1%. So it is extremely safe,\u201d Upadhyay says. \u201cWe also know that it\u2019s safer than Tylenol and safer than Viagra.\u201dRead More: Mississippi\u2019s Last Abortion Clinic Faces the Supreme CourtThe fight over medication abortion is already playing out in Texas, where nearly all abortions after six weeks have been banned since Sept. 1. Texas also prohibits telemedicine visits for medication abortion and medication abortions after seven weeks, before the FDA\u2019s approved cutoff. Even with these restrictions, Texas has seen a spike in people ordering abortion pills online since its six-week ban went into effect, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Friday. Orders for the pills from the international nonprofit Aid Access increased 1,180% in the first week after the Texas law took effect, going from nearly 11 purchases per day to more than 137 per day. While purchases leveled off over the next three months, the researchers found they stayed 174% higher during that time than before the law was in place. This is exactly what abortion opponents want to avoid. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen even in Texas as the Heartbeat Bill is still in effect, we see that the pills are going out the back door,\u201d Sue Liebel, state policy director at SBA List, said in January. \u201cSo this is an issue.\u201dFor the Texas researchers, this is evidence that the use of medication abortion is not going away. \u201cWe know that putting abortion restrictions in place does not mean the need for abortion just goes away. It\u2019s still there. And people will look oftentimes for other ways to get the care they need,\u201d says Abigail Aiken, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the lead author of the study. Aid Access can mail people abortion pills even in states like Texas that have outlawed sending the pills by mail because it is based outside the U.S. Aiken says that people are also increasingly turning to other online retailers to buy abortion pills on their own from services without doctor supervision, a process known as self-managed abortion, which her research has found can be safe and effective. Texas\u2019s Health and Human Services agency recently reported that abortions in the state dropped 51% in September 2021 when the state\u2019s six-week law went into effect. Those numbers, and the increase in medication abortion reported by Guttmacher, do not include abortion pills taken outside the formal health care system, so the total number of people using abortion pills in the U.S. is likely higher than reported, experts say, and only going to increase.\u201cI think as we see more restrictions,\u201d Aiken says, \u201cwe\u2019ll see self managed abortion play an increasingly important role in providing an option for people.\u201d More Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
