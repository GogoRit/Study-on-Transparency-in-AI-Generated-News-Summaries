(WLBT) - Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban could soon be argued before the highest court in the land.The state has filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking clarification of a lower court\u2019s decision declaring the state\u2019s 15-week abortion unconstitutional.The state is asking the court to look at the matter, saying that lower courts are using different legal standards to evaluate state abortion bans.The decision comes about 11 months after the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld District Court Judge Carlton Reeves' decision to block the law from going into effect.State leaders say the high court might be willing to consider the case, saying two circuit courts of appeals opinions \u201cwere split on which standard to apply in assessing a state\u2019s pre-viability abortion laws.\u201d\u201cIn one case, the Fifth Circuit applied a balancing of benefits and burdens \u2026 and only three days later the Sixth Circuit applied the undue-burden test,\u201d according to a statement from Attorney General Lynn Fitch.\u201cThe Supreme Court is more inclined to take a case like our defense of Mississippi\u2019s 15-week law when it provides the opportunity to clarify an issue on which circuits have split,\u201d the statement said.Matt Steffey, a professor of law at the Mississippi College School of Law, said the state\u2019s ultimate goal is to get the ban upheld or have Roe v. Wade repealed or significantly scaled back.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to give the Supreme Court a reason to take up the case, even though under existing law, the (lower decisions) were correct,\u201d he said.Steffey said the state isn\u2019t arguing the lower court\u2019s decision, per se, but rather the fact that lower courts are ruling on abortion bans using different standards.He said the court could be more willing to take up a case had some bans been upheld and others had been struck down.However, circuit and district courts have been striking down state abortion bans regularly.\u201cIt\u2019s always a long shot to get a case before the court,\u201d he said. \u201cOther states are also trying it.\u201dAt the heart of the matter is the state law that prohibits abortions during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, and whether it should be analyzed under the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard established in one case, or the \u201cbalancing of benefits and burdens\u201d standard established in another.In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court established the \u201cundue burden standard to separate permissible restrictions from those that are unconstitutional,\u201d according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.In a separate case, the high court adopted a balancing of benefits rule, which \u201cclarified that when courts assess benefits, they need to apply heighted scrutiny to the state\u2019s claims about whether and how a law actually advances a valid state interest,\u201d according to the center.Lower courts have used both standards in recent rulings on abortion bans.According to Fitch, \u201cWe wanted to bring this deepening circuit split to the court\u2019s attention.\u201dMississippi lawmakers approved a ban on abortions after 15 weeks in 2018.According to NBC News, the law was \u201clikely to be the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion law.\u201dNBC went on to say that the owner the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the state\u2019s only abortion clinic would file suit if the bill was signed.The law was eventually challenged by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Mississippi Center for Justice.In November 2018, NBC reported Reeves struck down the ban, saying it violated women\u2019s constitutional rights.The brief was filed on October 22.Copyright 2020 WLBT.
