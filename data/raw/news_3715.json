Donahue and Getty photos\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, a GOP U.S. senator this week announced new legislation that would establish a national abortion ban.\nThe bill, introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), would ban all abortions after 15 weeks. Many red states already have stricter bans than that, but it would override laws in many states that don\u2019t. Michigan has a 1931 abortion ban, which is currently blocked by the courts. Voters will decide Nov. 8 on Proposal 3 enshrining reproductive rights in the state Constitution.\nThe federal legislation would allow narrow exceptions for rape, incest or the life or health of the pregnant patient, though not if the diagnosis includes \u201cpsychological or emotional conditions.\u201d There are no exceptions for severe fetal anomalies or pregnancies that are otherwise nonviable.\nAt a Wednesday fundraiser in Detroit, President Joe Biden blasted Republicans for supporting a national abortion ban.\nBiden says Republicans \u2018want a national ban on abortion\u2019\n\nMichigan has four congressional races in November that are considered key to determining control of the U.S. House.\u00a0\nThe Democratic candidates have all criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturning Roe and support abortion rights: Hillary Scholten in the 3rd District, U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Lansing) in the 7th District, U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint) in the 8th District and Carl Marlinga in the 10th District.\nThe Democratic-led U.S. House passed legislation this summer that would codify abortion rights into law. Kildee and Slotkin, who are currently in office, both voted in favor of this legislation.\u00a0\nThe four Republicans battling for the hotly contested districts do not support abortion rights and have been endorsed by the state\u2019s leading anti-abortion group, Right to Life of Michigan: John Gibbs in the 3rd District, state Sen. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) in the 7th District, Paul Junge in the 8th District and John James in the 10th District.\nThe Michigan Advance reached out to the GOP candidates on their position on the Graham bill they could vote on if elected to Congress, but none responded.\u00a0\nThe response from other Republicans has been muted. A few Republican members of the U.S. Senate have spoken up, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who have said that they would prefer to see this decided in state legislatures.\u00a0\nAs the Advance wasn\u2019t able to get answers on Graham\u2019s bill, here is an overview of what the Democratic and Republican candidates in the four key Michigan races have said publicly about abortion.\n3rd Congressional District\u00a0\nGibbs, who previously worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Trump administration, will face Scholten, an immigration attorney, in the Nov. 8 election. The district includes Grand Rapids, Grand Haven and Muskegon.\nThe seat is open with U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Grand Rapids), who also celebrated the Dobbs ruling, losing his Aug. 2 primary to Gibbs.\nOn Gibbs\u2019 campaign site, he lists \u201cprotecting innocent unborn lives\u201d as one of his top priority issues.\u00a0\n\u201cThe right to act as one chooses does not extend to the taking of another\u2019s innocent life. We must protect the lives of unborn human beings as a top priority. One only knows which future CEO, President, or Pope, may have been born by a mother who contemplated abortion but was compassionately deterred by laws which protect life,\u201d the site reads.\u00a0\n  Hillary Scholten\nHe also lists \u201cmedical freedom\u201d as a priority, writing that \u201caggressive medical mandates violate the sacred American principle of freedom of individual choice, forcing our citizens to make potentially adverse decisions under threat of arrest or losing their livelihood and income. Such choices should always be up to each American alone and never forced by the government or corporations.\u201d\nAlthough Gibbs is against abortion rights, this description of medical freedom is similar to the arguments reproductive rights advocates are making to try to enshrine the right to abortion care in the state Constitution with Proposal 3.\u00a0\nScholten has been endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and would be the first woman to represent the district in Congress.\nOn her website, she said \u201cprotecting reproductive health care choices is fundamentally a matter of privacy and freedom from government control. It is a kitchen table issue, a worker\u2019s rights issue, a child welfare issue, and a healthcare worker protection issue.\u201d\n7th Congressional District\nSlotkin and Barrett will face off on the November ballot in what\u2019s considered one of the most competitive races in the nation. The district includes Lansing, East Lansing and Charlotte.\u00a0\nLast month, after Kansas voters turned down an abortion ban, Barrett took down a section of his website that detailed his anti-abortion stance. As reported by the Detroit News, Barrett said he was unaware of the change to his website, but said it was likely made to focus on \u201cthe issues that were most salient right now.\u201d\n  Rep. Elissa Slotkin talks to reporters after her town hall at Oakland University, Dec. 16, 2019 | Laina G. Stebbins\nMultiple polls show that Michiganders rank abortion as a primary motivator for the November election, especially among Democrats.\nThis shift was shocking to some after Barrett sent out fundraising flyers that said he was \u201c100% Pro-Life \u2013 No Exceptions.\u201d He also previously joined Republicans in the state Legislature to reinstate Michigan\u2019s 1931 law banning abortion. That effort was unsuccessful.\u00a0\nSlotkin has been endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\u201cI support the 50-year precedent set in Roe v. Wade, giving women the right to privacy in their own personal health decisions, including whether to end a pregnancy, up to the point of viability,\u201d Slotkin said in a press statement responding to Barrett\u2019s site change. \u201cIf a woman\u2019s health is at risk beyond that, a woman and her doctor \u2014 not the federal government\u2014 should make the decision about whether to terminate a pregnancy.\u201d\n8th Congressional District\nJunge, a former news anchor in Lansing and former external affairs director at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the Trump administration will face Kildee in the general election.
