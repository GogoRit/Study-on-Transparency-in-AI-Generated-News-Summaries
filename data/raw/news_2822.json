No it's Andri Ragettli ...\n\nGian Ragettli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndri Ragettli of Switzerland competes in the Men's Freeski Big Air of 2019 Air+Style Beijing FIS Snowboard World Cup at Shougang Park on December 13, 2019 in Beijing, China.\n\nLintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Though it didn\u2019t start out as a just a thrill-seeking quest for millions of views, Ragettli tells CNN Sport.\n    \n\n            \u201cThey [social media videos] just happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan them in the beginning. But now as I\u2019m growing on social media, I am more planning my videos. \n    \n\n            \u201cFor example, the video where I jumped like from eight meters into the snow. That was the day after a competition in the United States. Then we had a rest day before we flew to Canada for the next world cup. And it snowed overnight, like, yeah, like almost one meter and in the end, this video happened.\u201d \n    \n\n            The fun of producing videos hasn\u2019t distracted Ragettli from his professional goals though.\n    \n\n            The Swiss has already won seven world cup titles and four Crystal Globe trophies.\n    \n\n            This year he also won the first X-Games gold medal of his career, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process.\n    \n\n            \u201cAll of my idols won the X Games and I had some troubles with the X Games,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was my seventh appearance and I had like three medals, but only bronze. I just wanted to win the gold.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndri Ragettli of Switzerland competes during the Freestyle Skiing Men's Ski Slopestyle Final on day nine of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at Phoenix Snow Park on February 18, 2018 in Pyeongchang-gun, South Korea.\n\nCameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Ragettli speaks like an embattled veteran of his sport, who has been striving for his entire career to reach a single goal.\n    \n\n            We forget that he has only just turned 22 years of age.\n    \n\n            At X-Games Norway earlier this year, he finally achieved that 13-year old dream, winning his first X-Games gold medal in the men\u2019s Slopestyle.\n    \n\n            Ragettli is also the first person ever to perform a quad cork 1800 \u2013 four flips in mid-air \u2013 on skis.\n    \n\n            \u201cI think I have like a long way for my career,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I will still keep skiing, I hope, until I\u2019m 30 years old.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
