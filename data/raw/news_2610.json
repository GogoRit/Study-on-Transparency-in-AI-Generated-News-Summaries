(CNS photo/Shaun Heasley, Reuters)\nBy John Mulderig  \u2022 Catholic News Service \u2022 Posted May 28, 2020 NEW YORK (CNS) \u2014 The documentary \u201cAKA Jane Roe\u201d (FX, streaming on Hulu) is ostensibly a portrait of Norma McCorvey, the official but largely nominal plaintiff in the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, the outcome of which was the legalization of abortion across the United States.\nBut the film\u2019s real purpose is to drop a bombshell.\nIn it, McCorvey \u2014 who in later life became a prominent pro-life activist \u2014 denies that she ever changed her mind on the subject. Instead, in what she characterizes as her \u201cdeathbed confession,\u201d McCorvey, who died in 2017 at age 69, alleges she was manipulated by the movement and paid to say what its leaders wanted her to.\nWhile McCorvey\u2019s real outlook and motivation remain elusive, two things can be said with certainty: first, that she was a complicated person and second, that everyone interviewed for filmmaker Nick Sweeney\u2019s profile of McCorvey has an agenda of his or her own.\nOutspoken and earthy, McCorvey endured a childhood marked by poverty, her mother\u2019s alcoholism, petty crime, a spell in reform school and sexual abuse. By the time of her third pregnancy in 1969, she was, according to her own account, living on the streets, addicted to booze and drugs.\n[hotblock]\nUnable to face the prospect of having another child \u2014 her daughter, Melissa, was being raised by her mother and her second child had been adopted \u2014 McCorvey sought an illegal abortion. But she decided against going through with the procedure after seeing the unsanitary conditions in which it would be carried out.\nAn adoption attorney made her aware that two other lawyers, Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, were working to overturn her home state of Texas\u2019 abortion law. By the time the case was decided, she had long since given birth. Many people, McCorvey notes, are surprised to discover that she herself never had an abortion.\nHer subsequent career working at an abortion facility came to an abrupt end, however, when, under the influence of the Rev. Flip Benham, a well-known pro-life figure, she converted to evangelical Christianity and was baptized. In 1998, McCorvey was received into the Catholic Church.\nMcCorvey obviously represented a significant asset to the pro-life movement and made many appearances on its behalf. But had her views really changed? That depends on whom you ask.\nMcCorvey\u2019s denial that she was ever opposed to legal abortion comes as belatedly welcome news to former allies such as attorney Gloria Allred and Charlotte Taft, identified here as an \u201cabortion counselor.\u201d But it\u2019s also backed up by the Rev. Rob Schenck, who worked with McCorvey after her apparent about-face but claims to have entertained doubts as to her pro-life bona fides.\n[hotblock2]\nYet, although he remains an evangelical minister, Rev. Schenck, as the documentary eventually makes clear, no longer supports overturning Roe v. Wade, believing that the result of such a development would be \u201cchaos.\u201d Rev. Benham, who remains pro-life, by contrast, contests McCorvey\u2019s assertions.\nWhile balanced in its portrayal of the many aspects of McCorvey\u2019s complex personality, \u201cAKA Jane Roe\u201d is quite unfair in its treatment of the pro-life movement and its members.\nThey are portrayed as clamoring, verbally abusive extremists and the rare instances in which a tiny minority of misguided opponents of legal abortion have resorted to violence are deliberately magnified. Taft, seen in archival footage, says of pro-life adherents, \u201cWhat they have done is, over and over, used terrorism, fear tactics.\u201d\nThe sincerity of McCorvey\u2019s religious conversion does not seem in doubt, if only because one of its consequences, as related here, was the transformation of her longtime sexual relationship with Connie Gonzales, a woman she met while Roe was still making its way through the courts, into a platonic friendship.\nMcCorvey also had several religious symbols, including an image of the Sacred Heart, hanging on the walls of her nursing home room. With perhaps more than merely her characteristic flippancy, she identifies Jesus as \u201cmy boyfriend.\u201d The pillow of her deathbed \u2014 she is seen bidding goodbye to Melissa and two granddaughters \u2014 was adorned with a rosary.\nBut what of her moral and political views? Perhaps the last word should be left to McCorvey herself. \u201cI am a good actress,\u201d she says, speaking of her pro-life speeches and activities. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d\n\u201cAKA Jane Roe\u201d is rated TV-MA/L \u2014 mature audience only; crude indecent language.\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
