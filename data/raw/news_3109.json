Though the health system must provide the procedure, individual doctors can conscientiously object.Abortion rights campaigners said the time limits were too restrictive and would force women to continue to seek illegal, sometimes deadly, abortions.\u201cThe assembly has once again failed girls, women, survivors and victims of sexual violence,\u201d Sarahi Maldonado of feminist collective Las Comadres told Reuters outside the assembly. \u201cThey put in more barriers so girls are obliged to give birth and seek illegal abortions.\u201dAbortion has been legal in Ecuador since 1938 in cases when a woman\u2019s life is at risk or when a rape survivor has an intellectual disability. In 2019 the assembly failed to pass legislation legalizing abortion for rape.More than 21,000 abortions take place in Ecuador each year, according to feminist group Trenzando Feminismos, most of them in dangerous illegal clinics.\u201cLife cannot be negotiated,\u201d said Paul Garcia, who was protesting outside the legislature with anti-abortion groups. \u201cThey want to murder another victim inside the womb of the mother.\u201dAbortion is freely available in Argentina and Uruguay under certain time limits and several other Latin American countries have legalized it in cases of rape.Mexico\u2019s supreme court decriminalized abortion last year and Colombia\u2019s constitutional court is weighing the same decision.In Chile \u2013 where abortion is allowed for rape and other limited cases \u2013 President-elect Gabriel Boric has vowed to make it freely available.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorWomen's healthRape and sexual assaultAmericasAbortionShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMacron says battle for abortion rights is not over as France updates constitution8 Mar 2024MPs\u00a0and campaigners accuse Polish government of betrayal over abortion laws7 Mar 2024 France makes abortion a constitutional right in historic Versailles vote4 Mar 2024French move to make abortion a \u2018guaranteed freedom\u2019 gains big win in lower house30 Jan 2024Abortion rights will be in French constitution next year, Macron vows29 Oct 2023Woman in Malta charged in court for having abortion1 Jun 2023\u2018I will do the same again\u2019: activists continue fight against Poland\u2019s strict abortion laws 24 May 2023Japan approves abortion pill for the first time29 Apr 2023France moves closer to making abortion a constitutional right24 Nov 2022Malta drafts law allowing abortion if mother\u2019s life or health at risk21 Nov 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
