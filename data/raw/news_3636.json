Pro-life State Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-La., brought the smackdown on pro-abortion arguments on Dr. Phil Wednesday, while an audience member compared pregnancy to cancer.\u00a0    Jackson was on the show as part of an abortion discussion that had several speakers with views from across the spectrum. She responded to one abortion support by saying, \"When you said we\u2019re forcing pregnancy\u2014and I\u2019ve heard that on the stage, the truth is this, we\u2019re not forcing pregnancy.\"\u00a0She added, \"We\u2019re forcing adults to be responsible, which means responsibility for your actions.\"  That's when an audience member compared becoming pregnant with getting lung cancer from smoking cigarettes.  Louisiana State Senator Katrina R. Jackson on Dr. Phil   MORE THAN 100 PRO-LIFE ORGS, CHURCHES ATTACKED SINCE DOBBS LEAK  \"If that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to say, is that \u2018you have to face the consequence,\u2019 then someone who develops lung cancer from smoking, knowing there\u2019s a risk, should not be treated,\" the audience member argued, comparing abortion to the treatment of cancer. \"Though, that is medical treatment. Abortion is health care.\"Later in the episode, Jackson condemned the current framing of the entire abortion conversation where the killing of one\u2019s unborn is promoted as a means to escape financial strife, especially for minority women.  CBS host Dr. Phil and pro-life activist Lila Rose discuss abortion (CBS)  \"When I hear people saying, to the point of nine months, a healthy baby can be aborted\u2014and then let me tell you what\u2019s most offensive to me, Dr. Phil, is when I hear people say that for Black and Brown women, the remedy to them living in poverty is abortion,\" she said. \"Then, to me, we perpetuate the racism that we faced for years.\"RAISING PRO-LIFE KIDS IN A PRO-CHOICE CULTURE IN AMERICA: 'IT ALL BEGINS IN THE HOME,' SAY ACTIVISTS  \"I keep hearing as a Black or Brown woman, when I\u2019m sitting in poverty, the answer to my poverty is not to expand my family,\" she added.\u00a0  Pro-life demonstrators outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., US, on Friday, June 24, 2022.
