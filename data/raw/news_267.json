In this context, the story of how Soviet women won the right to abortion is a sad case of lost memory \u2014 it having been forgotten that it was achieved here earlier than in Western countries. Yet this fight was an important example of Soviet women\u2019s political activism \u2014 and a story that helps us reconstruct a wider history of socialist feminism in the USSR.\nSuch a reading runs against the long-dominant \u201ctotalitarian\u201d approach to writing Soviet history. This latter assumes that the USSR was a wholly top-down entity where everyone simply obeyed the orders of a monolithic party, and nothing else. Clearly, such an undifferentiated landscape leaves no place for the history of the women who fought for their rights. While since the 1980s this approach has faced a strong revisionist challenge, it remains persistent in gender history.\nThe influence of this approach is visible in the way that the chronology of Soviet gender politics is usually structured. Focusing on the main changes of political leadership, this chronology comes to an end with the abolition of the Zhenotdel (women\u2019s department) in 1930 \u2014 a move which brought the near-complete exclusion of women from political participation. Yet further exploring women\u2019s agency in Soviet gender politics, we can see that the history of feminist struggle never stopped \u2014 for it never reached final victory.\nThe decriminalization of abortion in the Soviet Union in 1955 is indicative, in this regard. This is especially true when we ask what this particular change tells us about the kinds of political subjectivity that the dominant Soviet discourse on gender equality enabled. This discourse \u2014an essential part of the Soviet project \u2014 created the \u201cSoviet woman\u201d as a political identity, which in many contradictory ways really could serve the promotion of women\u2019s interests.\nHere, we\u2019ll leave aside the question of whether this subjectivity was an expected outcome \u2014 or else worked against the actual intentions of male party leaders. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on a woman leader, Maria Kovrigina, who was one of the main actors in the decriminalization of abortion. In a sense, she had a biography typical of the Soviet nomenklatura. But her story also shows how, for all its limits and hypocrisy, even the official Soviet vision of women\u2019s empowerment really did contribute to the decriminalization of abortion.\n\n\n\nFrom Liberation to Criminalization\nAbortion on social and medical grounds had first been legalized in 1920 \u2014 making the young Soviet state the first country in the world to provide such a right. This did not mean a positive view of women\u2019s right to choose. Rather, women\u2019s need to resort to abortions was seen as the result of social conditions resulting from Tsarism, which would disappear with the development of socialism. For this reason, as Susan Gross Solomon shows, the women\u2019s department saw no contradiction between anti-abortion propaganda and the legalization of abortion.\nThe 1920 \u201cDecree on Women\u2019s Healthcare\u201d declared illegal abortion a \u201cserious evil to the community\u201d; it insisted that extensive social protections for maternity and infancy could secure \u201cthe gradual disappearance of this evil.\u201d But since both \u201cthe moral survivals of the past and the difficult economic conditions of the present still compel[led] many women to resort to this operation,\u201d it was necessary to provide it to women through the health care system, rather than allow its continued illegal practice.\nThis liberalization was not to last. In 1936, abortion on social grounds was criminalized again, in favor of a narrow list of medical criteria. Women who transgressed the ban not only risked serious injury or worse by having an illegal abortion, but if caught they also faced imprisonment. The new \u201cDecree on the Prohibition of Abortions and the Improvement of Material Aid to Women in Childbirth\u201d emphasized that improved social conditions meant women no longer \u201cneeded\u201d abortions \u2014 and, in any case, they had to uphold their role as mothers.\nAs this text reversing abortion rights insisted, \u201cIn no country in the world does woman enjoy such complete equality in all branches of political, social and family life as in the USSR. In no country in the world does woman, as a mother and a citizen who bears the great and responsible duty of giving birth to and bringing up citizens, enjoy the same respect and protection from the law as in the USSR. Only under conditions of socialism, where exploitation of man by man does not exist and where woman is an equal member of society, while the continual improvement of the material well-being of the toilers constitutes a law of social development, is it possible seriously to organize the struggle against abortions by prohibitive laws as well as by other means.\u201d\nThis was not the only Stalin-era \u201creform\u201d of reproductive rights. Following the devastation wrought by World War II, authorities made a fresh bid to push up birth rates, with the new Family Edict of 1944. As Mie Nakachi shows, the initial goal of this law (articulated only in a supplementary note) was to increase the number of children born even outside of marriage \u2014 this being seen as the only solution for the gender imbalance (i.e., a relative lack of men) which resulted from the war. The mechanism for achieving this was not just to give more support to women, but to liberate men from any responsibility for children born outside of an official marriage.\nAs against a previous system whereby children had enjoyed the same rights whether they were born inside or outside of wedlock, the 1944 law introduced the category of single mothers. Now, when a child\u2019s parents weren\u2019t married, the line on the birth certificate for the father\u2019s name would simply be left blank. According to the statistics presented by Nakachi, this didn\u2019t lead to the expected growth in the Soviet population, but the opposite. The result was a dramatic increase in the number of illegal abortions \u2014 bringing around four thousand deaths a year in 1949\u20131955 \u2014 as well as of supposed \u201corphans\u201d whose parents were, in fact, still alive.\n\n\nFeminists\u2019 Agency \u2014 and Its Limits\nBut this served as a call to action. Faced with the problems of declining population growth and high illegal abortion rates, numerous interministerial commissions were established, with women in leading roles. One such woman was Maria Kovrigina (1910\u20131995), a professionally trained medical doctor and hospital administrator. She was a member of the Soviet Women\u2019s Anti-Fascist Committee, an organization established in 1941 to propagandize internationally for the Soviet gender equality project.\nIn these commissions, Kovrigina consistently advocated for legal changes, indeed ones broader than the mere expansion of the criteria for legal abortion (and its ultimate decriminalization). But she could only get her proposals through after 1954, when she became the Soviet health minister.\nShe achieved this the following year with the 1955 law on \u201cThe Abolition of the Prohibition Against Abortion,\u201d which proclaimed that changed circumstances allowed the lifting of the ban. As it put it, \u201cThe measures taken by the Soviet Union to promote and protect children and to continuously increase the awareness and culture of women who are actively involved in all spheres of the national economic life of the country now allow for the abandonment of prohibited abortions by law. This may be due to the expansion of state measures to promote motherhood, as well as educational and awareness-raising.\u201d\nNotable, here, is the fact that like its predecessors (whether legalizing or criminalizing abortion) Kovrigina\u2019s text was again framed as a protection of motherhood and childhood. For this reason, scholars have tended to regard the 1955 law as part of the USSR\u2019s pro-natalist policies, designed to push up birth rates. But the fact that the 1950s debates on abortion were strongly connected with research on women\u2019s living conditions and childcare facilities can also be seen within the socialist-feminist frame of reproductive justice.\nSuch a frame (later developed, in their own ways, by Marxist feminists like Tithi Bhattacharya) established a connection between the right to make decisions and the material opportunities to afford having children. Hence while looking at Soviet gender politics in terms of the liberal feminist agenda of \u201crights\u201d may not show us a great deal, adopting the perspective of socialist and Marxist feminists may help provide a more nuanced picture.\nMoreover, as Nakachi shows, there was also a gap between the way abortion was discussed in the professional medical community, including by Kovrigina herself, and the way it was portrayed in the final draft of the law, which she presented to the Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee. For example, while in a discussion within the professional community Kovrigina had said that \u201cWomen should be given the right to decide for themselves,\u201d but in framing the final law she instead used the rationale and language of past, more restrictive legislation.\nThis shows us the limits to both women\u2019s agency and the possibility of changing the dominant discourse on gender equality in the Soviet Union. Some forces in Soviet society did, indeed, resist change \u2014 Nakachi suggests that a conservative position, opposed to any discourse of the \u201cright to choose\u201d was widespread at all levels, including within the Central Committee.\nIn this sense, Kovrigina\u2019s appeal to the dominant discourse may have been a conscious strategy for helping to push her favored legislation. Such a strategy resembles researcher Wang Zheng\u2019s concept of the \u201cpolitics of concealment,\u201d as deployed by the All-China Women\u2019s Federation (ACWF) in shaping gender politics under Mao Zedong. As Wang puts it, in \u201carticulating [the ACWF\u2019s] strong support of the Party\u2019s \u2018central tasks\u2019, state feminists often embedded a \u2018hidden script\u2019 that intended to advance women\u2019s diverse interests .\u2009.\u2009. camouflaging a feminist agenda with dominant Party language.\u201d\n\n\nForced to Be Empowered\nAs a prominent example of a woman political leader in the 1950s USSR, Maria Kovrigina\u2019s biography shows how even women who reluctantly entered the political domain could become real political subjects \u2014 and promote women\u2019s interests within the Soviet state.\nKovrigina\u2019s biography was in some ways typical of the Soviet nomenklatura of her generation. Coming from the peasantry, she welcomed the revolution (indeed, her elder brother was a founder of a local Bolshevik organization), and she joined the youth body Komsomol at the age of fourteen, helping to build a local pioneer organization. She had her professional training as a medical doctor, but her career after graduation turned toward hospital administration.\nAs she worked on organizing the evacuated hospitals in her home Ural region during the war, she was noticed in Moscow, and pushed to take up government positions. She became deputy head of the USSR Ministry of Healthcare (1942\u20131950), the minister of health care of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1950\u201354, RSFSR), and finally the USSR minister of health care (1954\u201359). She also remained a member of the presidium of the Soviet Women\u2019s Anti-Fascist Committee.\nThe reader will note that I said Kovrigina was \u201cpushed\u201d toward top roles \u2014 for she repeatedly refused such appointments. Not only did she try to resist becoming the deputy head of the USSR Ministry of Healthcare, but she later tried to quit her job as a Minister of Healthcare of RSFSR, because she felt she lacked the knowledge to perform a job with such responsibilities. She thus negotiated with the Central Committee that she would pursue an individual educational program, which she began in 1952.\nSuch a reaction is easily recognizable as a kind of \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d for a woman pushed to take a top job. But such a striking example also helps us think about how the Soviet state\u2019s need for women in the government \u2014 in accordance with a rhetoric of gender equality \u2014 could be seen as a form of \u201cforced empowerment\u201d which eventually turned into political subjectivity.\nIndeed, the official ideological construction of the \u201cSoviet woman\u201d as emancipated and equal could itself create a certain feeling of empowerment. This is obvious from the way Kovrigina framed abortion in her unpublished autobiography, as a sign of the Soviet state\u2019s respect toward women. She wrote this text in the 1980s, in a work tellingly also including a chapter on abortion. As she put it, \u201cThe ban on abortion humiliated the personality of the woman herself, it controlled the intimate side of her life, not to mention the fact that many women paid for it by their health and even life itself.\u201d\n\n\nInternational Movement\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that Kovrigina internalized Soviet rhetoric about women\u2019s equality \u2014 and took such pride in its record. After all, since the early 1940s she had been responsible for the propaganda promoting the Soviet gender project internationally. Here comes into play another important factor in her politicization, namely her active engagement in the work of the Soviet Women\u2019s Anti-Fascist Committee (later renamed Soviet Women\u2019s Committee, SWC) and, through its efforts, her connection with the international women\u2019s movement.\nAs a member of the SWC, Kovrigina attended various international congresses, for example the founding congress of the Women\u2019s International Democratic Federation (WIDF) in Paris in 1945. The importance of these congresses for Kovrigina is clear from the organization of her archive, submitted to the State Archive of the Russian Federation by her daughter after her death.\nKovrigina\u2019s papers contain artifacts from its congresses which she kept throughout her life, for instance a brochure from the WIDF\u2019s Budapest congress. The importance of these congresses to Kovrigina is also apparent from the way she reflects on them in her memoirs \u2014 noting that her first trip abroad was her journey to the WIDF\u2019s founding congress in Paris.\nBesides the excitement she recalled at such voyages, these congresses also gave Kovrigina a glimpse \u2014 however mediated by the Soviet translation \u2014 of the concerns of the global women\u2019s movement. This was especially notable in her observation of the worldwide development of contraception \u2014 a theme which was brought back to the USSR and raised during the debate over abortion.\n\n\n\u201cState Feminism\u201d\nThere are still many details in the story that need to be clarified: what other factors made such legislation even possible, what forces resisted such changes, and what connected initiatives and debates were there among the group that developed the 1955 law legalizing abortion.\nHowever, Kovrigina\u2019s story itself presents an interesting paradox for any discussion of Soviet feminism. In many ways, she lacked agency in the process of her empowerment. Acknowledgement of this fact would seem to tally with a negative characterization of the Soviet gender equality project as \u201cstate feminism\u201d \u2014 i.e., as a feminist agenda appropriated by the state and then simply imposed on citizens. Indeed, as we have seen, Kovrigina was promoted against her will, probably for the sake of a formal increase in women\u2019s \u201crepresentation\u201d in the government.\nBut the result was that Kovrigina really did become a political actor, fighting for women\u2019s rights. As the history of many other legal initiatives for women in the USSR after World War II shows, she was not the only woman to take up such a position.\nFor all the limits and hypocrisy of Soviet socialism, its vision of gender equality did enable a certain type of female political subjectivity \u2014 one that felt empowered and was able to take part in policymaking. Despite the widespread assumption that women disappeared from Soviet politics after the abolishment of the women\u2019s department, activists like Kovrigina show that their agency was not entirely lacking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nContributors\nSasha Talaver is a PhD candidate in the gender studies department of the Central European University in Budapest.\n\n\nFiled Under\n\n\n\nRussia\n\n\n\n\nSociety\n\n\nFeminism\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\nAbortion\n\n\nSoviet Union\n\n\nSocialist Feminism\n\n\nUSSR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobin Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our mailing list\n\n\n\n\n              This doesn\u2019t appear to be a valid email.\n            \n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n          Thanks for signing up! \u2192\n\nAlready on our list?
