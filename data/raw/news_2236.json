Kelly Loeffler, a Republican.Dungy\u00a0responded that Warnock \u201cmay be a pastor\u201d but \u201cMy question would be \u2018Is he a Christian?\u2019 That is, does he follow the teachings of Jesus and does he believe that the Bible is the absolute word of God?\u201d (Dungy originally called Warnock \u201cWarren\u201d but blamed it on auto-correct.)When pressed on his comments, Dungy responded, \u201cI would think it would be difficult for someone who believes that God sees us when we are in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16) to think that it is OK to choose not to bring that life to fruition.\u201dI would think it would be difficult for someone who believes that God sees us when we are in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16) to think that it is OK to choose not to bring that life to fruition.\u2014 Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) December 10, 2020One person argued abortion should be legal because a woman \u201cshould choose what happens\u201d to her body. Dungy wrote back, \u201cPlease read Psalm 139:13-16. Then tell me if you think God puts babies in the womb or man does? If you believe they randomly get there then I have no argument. But if you believe God puts them there, then how does anyone have a right to \u2018choose\u2019 which ones survive?\u201dPlease read Psalm 139:13-16. Then tell me if you think God puts babies in the womb or man does? If you believe they randomly get there then I have no argument. But if you believe God puts them there, then how does anyone have a right to \u201cchoose\u201d which ones survive?\u2014 Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) December 10, 2020Another person defended Warnock by saying advocating \u201cfor a right\u201d is not necessarily \u201can endorsement of a moral wrong.\u201d Dungy responded, \u201cWhat if I was advocating for the right to kill someone who was already born? Would that be morally OK? Of course not. The only question in this debate is what we think of the unborn baby? Is it a life or is it not?\u201dWhat if I was advocating for the right to kill someone who was already born? Would that be morally OK? Of course not. The only question in this debate is what we think of the unborn baby? Is it a life or is it not?\u2014 Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) December 10, 2020Still another person said it was \u201cstupid\u201d to \u201cquestion whether, if you are pro-choice\u201d you are \u201ca follower of Christ.\u201d Dungy replied, \u201cBecause many people do it doesn\u2019t make it right. There were many Christian leaders who didn\u2019t denounce slavery and apartheid, who remained silent about Jim Crow segregation laws or actually supported them because it was politically correct. That doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201dOne person challenged Dungy on his definition of Christian.\u201cA Christian is someone who dedicates their life to the service of the poor, the sick, and the marginalized. Someone who lives without judgment or lies. This applies to about 0 percent of conservative \u2018Christians,\u2019\u201d the person wrote.Dungy replied, \u201cA Christian is someone who believes Jesus is the son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins. They follow God\u2019s teachings and use the word of God to make all their decisions. I don\u2019t know how many people in the world that applies to but there are many.\u201dAlveda King, an author and pro-life activist, also questioned the beliefs of Warnock this week. She is the niece of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201cHe is doing such a disservice to his own congregation \u2014 to the women and the men and the families, the children, and his community,\u201d King\u00a0told Faithwire. \u201cHe should be giving them alternatives: \u2018There are better ways to live. Let me as pastor of this church help you so you don\u2019t have to kill a baby and hurt your own body.\u2019\u201dWarnock, she added, \u201cshould offer real, genuine service to his parishioners that cannot include abortion. God said choose life. He didn\u2019t give any excuses for not choosing life.\u201dRelated:Raphael Warnock \u2018Used the Bible to Justify Abortion,\u2019 Loeffler Charges during Senate DebateMegachurch Pastor: Abortion \u2018Is Consistent with\u2019 Christianity and \u2018I Will Fight\u2019 to Keep it LegalPhoto courtesy: \u00a9Getty Images/Scott Halleran/StaffMichael Foust has covered the intersection of faith and news for 20 years.
