We got a chance to choose any topic, any argument, any position,\u201d he told a large crowd assembled at the National Mall. \u201cI chose to talk about the dignity of human life from natural conception to natural death and the evil of abortion and euthanasia.\u201d\nBorn the year after the landmark Supreme Court abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, the gregarious 47-year-old priest of the Diocese of Duluth, Minnesota, is best known for his \"Bible in a Year\" podcast and his YouTube videos for Ascension, the Catholic multimedia publisher.\nA headline speaker at the pre-march rally, Schmitz, a North Star State native accustomed to the frigid January weather, received a rousing, rock-star reception from the crowd, which included thousands of young marchers.\nHe used the occasion to stress the same message he originally shared with his classmates as a young adolescent: every human life matters. This time, the message was deeply personal.\nSchmitz told the story of his maternal grandmother, Helen, a nurse who spoke out in defense of the unborn and the conscientious objections of her fellow nurses when the hospital where they worked decided to peform abortions in the wake of the Roe decision.\n\u201cHelen, she knew that people mattered. She knew that children mattered. She knew that her nurses mattered. And so she hated the fact that this hospital that had done such good in that part of the world was now about to do so much evil. And they were forcing her nurses to participate in abortions. They were forcing her nurses to carry the remains of these children to be disposed. And so she went to the board of directors and she said, \u2018This needs to stop. Either you stop doing abortions or I'm leaving,\u2019\u201d Schmitz recalled.\nThe board refused, and his grandmother left her job as head nurse. That decision \u201calmost destroyed her life\"; she didn\u2019t regret it, \u201cbut it broke her heart,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, too, right? I think we're here because abortion, what it's done is broken our hearts. And I know so many people here, you're standing here because you know the dignity of human life. And so many people are among us because this story is part of your story, because you found yourself at one point in a place where it seemed like life was an impossible choice,\" he said.\n\"And so I know that we're surrounded by men and women who have chosen abortion. Listen, you need to know you're supposed to be here. You matter, you belong here. No matter what your past is, you are still loved. You need to know this. You are still loved and you still matter.\u201d You can watch Schmitz's full speech in the EWTN video below.\nStruggling to maintain his composure at times, Schmidt went on to share a recent conversation he had with a woman he helped persuade not to abort her child 12 years ago.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I thought I hated my baby. And I realized these many years later, I didn't hate my baby. I hated the circumstances in which I found myself. I didn't hate my baby. I was ashamed of myself,\u2019\u201d Schmitz said.\n\u201cThat young woman, 12 years ago, she gave her son to a couple who adopted him and have loved him. And he's blessed their life. And they've blessed his life. I've met him. He's an incredible young man,\u201d Schmitz said.\nHe said the woman urged him ahead of his speech to remind people \u201cthat regardless of your choices, you are still loved and you still matter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd that's why we're standing here. That's why we're walking here,\u201d Schmitz said.\n\u201cWhen my grandma Helen \u2026 left Sinai Hospital in 1973, it didn't change the hospital, it didn't change the culture, it didn't change the law, it didn't change the country,\u201d he said.\nBy\u00a0Shannon Mullen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Advertisers Support Our Ministries\n\n\n\nPlease Support Our Advertisers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost  Viewed Articles of the Last 30 Days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVatican on France\u2019s Abortion Amendment: There Cannot Be a \u2018Right\u2019 To Take a Human Life\n Posted on March 05, 2024 in:  News,  ProLife\n 1056\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Vatican City\u00a0-\u00a0 France has become the first country in the world to enshrine the right to abortion in its basic law, a move that has been staunchly opposed by the French bishops and by the Vatican.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Pontifical Academy for Life reiterates that precisely in the era of universal human rights, there cannot be a \u2018right\u2019 to take a human life,\u201d the academy wrote in a March 4\u00a0statement\u00a0released by the Bishops\u2019 Conference of France following the historic vote.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Pontifical Academy for Life (PAV) went on to app...\n     \n    \n           Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecticut March for Life to Encompass Mass, Rally, March and Advocacy\n Posted on March 13, 2024 in:  ProLife\n 394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Next week, thousands of pro-life advocates will be descending on Hartford for the third annual Connecticut March for Life.
