While there is no direct correlation between those who are \u201cpro-life\u201d and pro-death penalty, these views do have one connecting point: an inability to empathize with others. Getty Images Yasmina Sahir, Opinions Columnist July 10, 2022\nIt appears the \u201cpro-life\u201d community believes life is precious in all circumstances unless society deems you undesirable.\nTies between those who consider themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d and pro-death penalty shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\nWhile \u201cpro-life\u201d advocates are not always pro-death penalty and vice versa, there is one striking similarity between the movements: a lack of empathy for others.\n\n\n\n\nOn April 12, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed into law one of the strictest limits on abortion in the country. This law made performing or receiving an abortion a felony in every instance excluding rape/molestation, incest, or in cases when harm to the pregnant person is inevitable if they continue their pregnancy.\nThis law supposedly affirms the majority opinion in Oklahoma that life begins at conception and should be protected in all circumstances.\nOnly weeks later, Oklahoma attorney general John O\u2019Connor pushed for execution dates to be finalized for 25 death row inmates. If plans follow through as currently outlined, all 25 individuals will be executed sometime in the next 29 months.\nSeveral of those incarcerated now facing execution have maintained their innocence. Although 78 percent of people recognize the concern that the justice system may execute innocent people, 60 percent of U.S. adults still favor the death penalty.\nUnder the current Republican majority, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, it remains unclear whether or not future Iowan laws and practices will begin to look as contradictory as Oklahoma\u2019s.\nThe death penalty remains illegal and unused in Iowa except in federal circumstances. Recent legislative movements in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to reverse the 1965 decision have all failed. In 2006, the most recent poll done on public opinion of capital punishment, 66 percent of Iowa adults favored the death penalty.\nSimilar to capital punishment, the constitutional standing of abortion in the state remains unclear. On July 5, the Iowa Supreme Court referred Reynolds\u2019 request to reconsider and strengthen Iowa abortion restrictions to a lower court. While abortion before 20 weeks remains legal for now, a 24-hour waiting period and other restrictions may soon become law.\nAlthough it may be the case in Oklahoma and soon in Iowa, it is important to note that these views do not always go hand in hand.\nBetween 1977 and 2021, the number of people who favor the death penalty for homicide convictions and who also believe that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances has shrunk significantly. In the same time period, more people have begun to oppose the death penalty in homicide cases and are more in favor of abortion.\nSome people argue the hypocrisy of the \u201cpro-life\u201d movement. In a Washington Post column, Cynthia Dalton calls out the \u201cpro-life\u201d community.\n\u201cIf one calls oneself \u2018pro-life\u2019\u2026yet is in favor of banning abortion; that person is not \u2018pro-life,\u2019 they are anti-abortion,\u201d said Dalton. \u201cIf people who are anti-abortion only would just be honest and not claim to be \u2018pro-life\u2019 it would help these complicated situations be less intensely divisive.\u201d\nMy pro-life and pro-death penalty peers have most consistently shown me how easy it is to stand behind moral convictions when their own safety isn\u2019t on the line. This is far scarier and more telling of human nature than any singular political stance, including the ramifications of the \u201cpro-life\u201d ideology the U.S. faces in 2022.\nThe willingness to force one\u2019s own moral compass onto others even when they face deadly consequences is where real societal danger lies within ideological systems like \u201cpro-life,\u201d pro-capital punishment movements.\nNo matter which side of the politics you align on, the ability to walk in other people\u2019s shoes and consider their perspectives is a necessary component of responsible, equitable legislation.\n\nColumns reflect the opinions of the authors and are not necessarily those of the Editorial Board, The Daily Iowan, or other organizations in which the author may be involved.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nColumnsOpinions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa men's basketball notebook | NIT controversy, scouting Kansas StateIowa Senate passes Area Education Agency overhaulThree takeaways | Iowa softball finishes with 6-5 record in Silicon Valley TournamentIowa City man arrested for stabbingIowa men's basketball earns No. 3 seed, will take on Kansas State in first round of NIT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nNavigate LeftColumnsOpinion | Protecting Trump while restricting Iowans\u2019 voting access is hypocriticalColumnsOpinion | Iowa mandatory minimum sentencing laws contribute to an already ineffective justice systemColumnsOpinion | People need to look out for toxic positivityColumnsOpinion | The Religious Freedom Restoration Act puts all Iowans\u2019 health care at stakeColumnsOpinion | FAFSA is leading students away from financial aidColumnsOpinion | Reflecting on Israel\u2019s genocide after four months of warColumnsOpinion | It is time to move on from toxic weight loss trends like OzempicColumnsOpinion | A new Iowa \u201cReligious Freedom\u201d bill could protect discriminatory actionsColumnsOpinion | The UI\u2019s learning assistant program expansion will benefit studentsColumnsOpinion | Iowa needs to prioritize juvenile prevention and rehabilitationNavigate Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nStaff\nDonate\nNewsletters\nPrint Subscription\nReprints and Permissions\nPublishing Guidelines\nEditorial Policy\nRSS Feeds\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\nApply\nJob Descriptions\nFAQ\nScholarship Opportunities\n\n\nAdvertise\n\nAdvertising Info / Rate Card\nToday\u2019s Classified Ads\n\n\nThe Daily Iowan archives (1868-present)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Student Publications, Inc.
