Planned Parenthood clinic.Erica Caporaletti, a 22-year-old student at Townson University in nearby Maryland, was arrested along with 29-year old D.C. resident Warner DePriest. They were arrested while writing the phrase, and charged with defacing public or private property. They were detained and cited, but reportedly returned to the scene about an hour later.\u00a0The pair were participating in a protest\u00a0organized by Students for Life of America. The group claims it was originally told it could paint in the street, and was even issued a permit.\u00a0\u201dAfter applying and receiving our permit and after being told by the Metropolitan police that the Mayor has \u2018opened a Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 by painting public streets, Students for Life arrived at the D.C. Planned Parenthood on Saturday, August 1st to six police cars threatening to arrest our team and student leaders if we painted \u2018BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER,\u2019 even using the temporary paint we bought that the Police Department specifically requested,\u201d the group recounted. \u00a0\u201dWhen we asked if we could at least use sidewalk chalk to chalk our anti-violence message on the streets, the police threatened to arrest us.\u201dVideo footage of the arrest shows Caporaletti rushing to finish as much of the writing as possible before being handcuffed.\u00a0WATCH:\u201cJust weeks ago D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser painted the streets of the city with a powerful slogan, \u201cBLACK LIVES MATTER,\u201d explained Students For life in its petition to demand permission from Mayor Muriel Bower to continue painting demonstrations.\u00a0\u201cIn doing this, she proclaimed not only what those of us in the pro-life genuinely believe and fight for every day in-front of Planned Parenthoods and other abortion facilities across America. But she also opened up the streets of Washington, D.C. for public expression.\u201d[RELATED: WATCH: Smug vandal rips out pro-life crosses, compares pro-lifers to flat-Earthers]\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing to [be] arrested for something that I\u2019ve done so often, simply share my conviction that abortion is a human rights issue of our day costing the loss of black lives and harming women in this-and every-community,\u201d DePriest told Campus Reform.\u201cThe violence of abortion costs millions of lives across this country every day, and we can\u2019t be silent,\u201d he added.Our free speech rights are meaningless if we can\u2019t use them, and women need to know that we are here to support and help them, said DePriest\u201cThe fact that two Students for Life of America students were arrested for chalking \u2018Black Preborn Lives Matter\u2019 shows that government officials are practicing viewpoint discrimination to unconstitutionally block pro-life American\u2019s Free Speech rights. If you open the door to free speech on the city streets to one group, you can\u2019t shut it to the others,\u201d President of Students for Life of America Kristin Hawkins told Campus Reform.\u00a0Follow the author of this article on Twitter:\u00a0@SavannahDudzikTagsStudents for LifeBlack Lives MatterShare this articleSavannah Dudzik Communications Assistant, Illinois Right to LifeSavannah Dudzik is a communications assistant at Illinois Right to Life.
