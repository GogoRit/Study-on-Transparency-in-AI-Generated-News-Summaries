With the relationship between the two cities has come political maneuvering between the elected officials from both. Amarillo Mayor Ginger Nelson and Lubbock Mayor Dan Pope have both worked hand-in-hand on a number of initiatives, including a trip by both of the Mayors, alongside El Paso Mayor Dee Margo in 2017, in which the three officials lobbied Governor Greg Abbott against proposed property tax reform legislation. With big spending initiatives and ballooning tax burdens in both communities, and across Texas, both Nelson and Pope have come under criticism for the same types of spending habits. While Amarillo voters still have a year to wait before the next municipal election, one Lubbock resident is bringing the choice for mayor to voters in that city\u2019s upcoming municipal election.Lubbock musician Stephen Sanders is challenging Pope in the city\u2019s upcoming May 2 election for the Hub City\u2019s top elected spot. Sanders is a self-described pro-life conservative who is currently seeking an advertising degree from Texas Tech University with plans to soon open an advertising firm to serve small businesses. After serving in the U.S. military, Sanders returned to Lubbock and became actively involved in his church, where he eventually met his wife. Sanders is known as a community servant in Lubbock, feeding the homeless and working as a team builder. In 2018, Sanders ran as a write-in candidate for mayor after missing the filing deadline. Sanders ran a hard fought campaign and ended up with about 4 percent of the vote, even though he was not listed on the ballot as a candidate. Now, he is running for mayor as a full fledged candidate who pledges to bring all communities together in Lubbock.\u201cI realized in the midst of the last campaign that I have a purpose: to bring people together from all races, all nationalities, all backgrounds,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMy one dream is to see our city not look at color, not look at race, not look at how much money you have. I also want to see East Lubbock and North Lubbock to not be forgotten about.\u201dSanders takes issue with Mayor Pope\u2019s record on issues such as taxes and spending. In an interview with the Pioneer, Sanders said he feels a more conservative approach should be taken to these issues and mentioned he feels Pope has been too willing to support tax increases while collecting accolades for his record.\u201cRight now Dan Pope says he's a conservative mayor but we are just spending money like crazy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have to reel it in, calm down, and get done with the projects we have, and give the citizens a chance to breathe. This is a retirement city and there are people who come here to retire. If you look at the tax increases since Mr. Pope's been in office, it just goes up and up and up. Let's reel it in and focus on the issues that matter.\u201dInstead of the current way of conducting business in Lubbock, Sanders says he will take a new and independent attitude to work for taxpayers.\u201cI am for the people. Nobody can buy me or lure me in. I want to do what's best for the people and give them a break,\u201d Sanders said.In a question posed for the interview, Sanders also noted Pope\u2019s trip to Austin with Nelson and Margo in 2017, saying he would \u201cbe against what they did,\u201d adding that he would rather look to cut spending than to seek additional tax increases. Sanders went on to say he would be more proactive in being a voice for the people, if elected.\u201cThe mayor is an extension of the people,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope/Photo by KFYO\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the relationship between Amarillo and Lubbock, Sanders says he believes he will be a unifying voice for all communities across West Texas.\u201cOnce I'm in office, some things are going to change,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThings are going to be open. I think it will really light West Texas up in a positive way. We're going to bring life back and love back. People are going to win. They are going to win because the people are the city.\u201dSanders and Pope will face off in the mayoral election scheduled for May 2. Some city council races will also be on the ballot.For more information about Sanders, visit https://www.facebook.com/pg/stephenforlubbock2020.\n\n\n\n\nThomas Warren\nRegional News, Election Coverage\n\nMarch 19 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook0\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n0 Likes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Warren\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                \n                  Leave a comment\n                  \n                \n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Warren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 19 Sod Poodles to Close Front Office, Team Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 18 Amarillo Weather (March 18-20)\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 19\n\n\nFeb 19 Texas Tech Student to Challenge Lubbock Mayor Pope\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct  8\n\n\nOct  8 Sanders, Pope Squaring Off in Important Race for Lubbock and West Texas\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 12\n\n\nOct 12 Candidate Comparison: Lubbock Mayor\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nIt's free!\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by Squarespace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
