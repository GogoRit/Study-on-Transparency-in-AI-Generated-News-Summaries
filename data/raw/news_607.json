The regulation is part of the REMS protocol, reserved for higher-risk drugs and procedures.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other pro-abortion groups pushed for the restrictions to be lifted during the COVID-19 pandemic so women would not have to travel to get the abortion pill; they successfully won an injunction on the restrictions in July, at a federal district court.\nJudge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland ruled that women could be prescribed the pill remotely and have it delivered or mailed to them.\nIn response, members of Congress asked the FDA to classify the abortion pill regimen as a public health hazard, and remove it from the market.\nJustice Department attorneys appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which in October did not reverse Chuang's decision or rule on the merits of the case; the court rather sent the case back to be reconsidered in several weeks, with the administration having an opportunity to present new evidence for its case.\nChuang did not change his ruling in a Dec. 9 decision, writing that the pandemic circumstances have not changed and women would still have difficulties traveling to obtain a prescription for the pill regimen in-person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wrote that \"particularly in light of the substantial spread of COVID-19 in recent weeks that increases the risk of all travel, the Court does not find that any changes to economic conditions or access to medical facilities, childcare, or transportation since the issuance of the (prior block on the rule) have been so favorable as to constitute changed circumstances\"to justify lifting the block.\nThe administration then appealed back to the Supreme Court, saying it presented new evidence to Chuang that its restrictions are not an unlawful \"undue burden\" on abortion, because abortions increased in 2020 in states where the regulations remained.\nChief Justice Roberts was joined in his decision by newly appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett, as well as Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor penned a dissent, and Stephen Breyer also said he believed the previous ruling should have been left in place.\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nAbortion pill, \nAbortion in the United States, \nSupreme Court of the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Catholic News Agency (CNA) Staff are a team of journalists dedicated to reporting news concerning the Catholic Church around the world.
