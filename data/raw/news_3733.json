Women make up half of the population, yet they are not getting an equal share and full opportunity to participate in the economy. I will continue to work to expand women\u2019s rights, especially when it comes to guaranteeing a woman\u2019s ability to make her own health care decisions, ensuring women get equal pay for equal work and pushing for stronger economic opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccomplishments\nWomen\u2019s Health and Wellbeing\n\nSupported funding for Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funding and legislation to reauthorize VAWA.\n\n\nChampioned provisions to end the ban on allowing veterans with reproductive issues due to service related injuries to have access to IVF and adoption.\n\n\nVoted repeatedly to protect women\u2019s health care by standing with Planned Parenthood and the women who rely on the organization for their health care. Decisions about health care should remain between a woman and her doctor.\n\n\nSupported increased funding to expand women\u2019s healthcare, including maternal health and ovarian cancer research.\n\n\nSupported the Global Health, Empowerment, and Rights (HER) Act, to permanently repeal the harmful global gag rule which bans federal funds for foreign non-governmental organizations that provide abortion services or provide information about abortion as part of comprehensive family planning services.\n\n\nSupported the Protect Access to Birth Control Act, to repeal the final rules issued by the administration that threaten to curtail access to affordable birth control for thousands of women.\n\nEqual Pay for Equal Work\n\nCosponsored the Raise the Wage Act, to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour and tie future increases to the median hourly wage. Nearly six in ten minimum wage workers are women. Women, who make up 49 percent of the workforce, account for 56 percent of low-wage earners.\n\n\nCosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, to ensure women are paid based on their skills and experience, not their gender.\n\n\nCosponsored the Schedules That Work Act, which allows low-wage workers to request for flexibility of their schedules without retaliation.\n\n\nCosponsored the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to help end discrimination against pregnant women and mothers in the workplace.\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\nLarsen: Extreme GOP Bill Restricts Reproductive Health Care, Hurts Northwest Washington Families\n\nNovember 14, 2023 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\nLarsen Joins Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus\n\nOctober 12, 2023 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\nLarsen Statement on Defense Policy Bill Vote\n\nJuly 14, 2023 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\nLarsen Votes to Protect Access to Birth Control\n\nJuly 21, 2022 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\nLarsen Votes to Protect Reproductive Health Care Rights for Women, Ensure Safe Access to Abortion Care\n\nJuly 15, 2022 | Posted in Press Releases\n\n\n\n\nAll Related News \u00bb\n\n\nRelated Files\n\n\n\r\n          Letter to Leadership to Support Emergency Title X Funding\r\n        \n\n\n\nAll Related Files \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstay connected\n\n\n SUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice Locations\n\n\n\n\nWashington, DC Office\r\n2163 Rayburn HOB\r\nWashington, DC 20515\r\nPhone: (202) 225-2605 \r\nFax: (202) 225-4420\r\nHours: Monday-Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET\r\n\n\n\n\nEverett Office\r\nWall Street Building\r\n2930 Wetmore Avenue, Suite 9F\r\nEverett, WA 98201\r\nPhone: (425) 252-3188 \r\nFax: (833) 696-6499\r\nHours: Monday-Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\n\n\n\nBellingham Office\r\n119 North Commercial Street\r\nSuite 275\r\nBellingham, WA 98225\r\nPhone: (360) 733-4500 \r\nHours: By appointment only\r\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nContact\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook-page\ntwitter-page\ninstagram-page\nyoutube-page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
