The slate of bills passed out of the House today have one goal in mind: to bring a direct challenge to\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0to the Supreme Court, and make abortion inaccessible in Kentucky.\u00a0This legislation will affect the health and well being of more than half of Kentucky\u2019s population\u2014restricting access to abortion care even in cases of rape and incest.\nHouse Bill 67, a bill that would amend the Kentucky Constitution to prohibit any protections for safe and legal abortion passed out of the House in a vote of 70-21, and\u00a0House Bill 451\u00a0passed on a vote of 71-23 and would give the Republican Attorney General power to negate decisions made by the governor\u2019s appointed Secretary of Cabinet for Health and Family Services in matters pertaining to abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cLast month, the Kentucky General Assembly silenced five women when they attempted to speak out against the advancement of this constitutional amendment. Today, a number of House Representatives shared their stories of strength, abuse and rape, but Republican leadership decided to ignore these pleas and ignore what the majority of Kentuckians want and advanced this bill,\u201d said Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky State Director for PPAIK. \u201cBills like this put\u00a0people\u2019s health and lives in jeopardy.\u00a0 When abortion is not an option, Kentuckians suffer. States with more abortion restrictions tend to have poorer health outcomes for women and children than other states, including higher rates of maternal and infant mortality. Kentucky already has some of the most extreme abortion restrictions in the country \u2013 the last thing we need is the legislature to pave the way for a ban on safe, legal abortion.\u201d\n\nWhile the Republican supermajority is behind these bills, more than 10 Kentucky House Democrats voted in favor of the bill, including\u00a0Reps. Branham Clark, Graviss, Hatton, Hinkle, Howard, Meyer, Schamore, Sims, Stone,Tackett Laferty, Wheatley and Wiederstein.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the U.S., 1 in 3 women of reproductive age lives in a state where abortion could be outlawed if Roe is overturned. That\u2019s over 25 million people. Nationally,\u00a077 percent of\u00a0Americans believe that abortion should be safe and legal, and in Kentucky, nearly\u00a07-in-10 people\u00a0say they don\u2019t want to see \u2018laws passed that ban abortion in the state Legislature.'\u00a0\n\n\n###\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky\u2019s\u00a0(PPINK) mission is to serve persons in Indiana and Kentucky \u2014without bias or judgment, without fear, without fail \u2014 by providing access to high-quality health care confidentially and compassionately; by reducing unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections through age-appropriate and accurate sexual health education; and by advocating for freedom of individual choice in all matters of sexual health and reproductive justice.\nPPINK\u2019s doors are open to all who need care and we provide our services in a confidential, compassionate and non-judgmental manner.
