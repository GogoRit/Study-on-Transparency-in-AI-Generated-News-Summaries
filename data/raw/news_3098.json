Wade\u2019s last anniversary as it is,\u201d said Kester. \u201cHiding behind technicalities doesn\u2019t change the fact that a young girl was not allowed the same opportunities to talk with her fellow students that others enjoyed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSadly, teacher engagement and bullying made E.\u2019s freshman year even more stressful.\u00a0When the lawsuit was first filed,\u00a0E.D. said: \u201cI wanted to start this club to inspire like-minded students to advocate for our most vulnerable and point students to resources designed to uplift them in their time of need. I knew some people would disagree with me, but I never expected to be attacked online\u2014especially by my teachers.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nStudents for Life has written previously on the case, noting that during the process of attempting to get approval for her club, E.D. showed school officials a flyer that \u201cincluded a photo of young students in front of the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington D.C. holding signs that read, \u2018We are the pro-life generation\u2019 and \u2018Defund Planned Parenthood.\u2019\u201d Both signs are part of the Students for Life of America messaging at pro-life events nationwide. E.D. reported that after seeing those images, school officials became unresponsive and unavailable as she tried to get the club started.\u00a0\u00a0\nOf note, clubs not related directly to educational goals are included at Noblesville High School, such as Young Democrats, Police Explorers, Black Student Union, Gender and Sexual Alliance, Conservation club, a \u201cComedy Sports Club\u201d as well as a \u201cDungeons and Dragons\u201d group.\u00a0Worse, administrators tacitly approved other flyers that contained clear political policy-related imagery all while ensuring the pro-life student group\u2019s flyers went unapproved. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSadly, viewpoint discrimination is common across the country, as Hawkins\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a Wall Street Journal op-ed\u00a0piece. Of the common strategies by administrators to oppose free speech, the third, fourth and fifth listed below seem prevalent in this case:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0vandalization\u00a0and outright theft of displays and signs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A virtual poll tax on speech often in the form of security fees not charged to all who require it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Heckler\u2019s Veto, in which schools cancel or move events when extremist groups or a disgruntled student oppose a speaker.\u00a0\u00a0A slow walk to nowhere when a pattern of delays for approval of events or clubs creates a virtual veto of student speech.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A not-even-separate-but-equal accommodation as schools refuse similar support for pro-life students as given to others.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A religious gag rule in which schools may allow students to speak as long as they stay silent about faith.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A required \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d in which the school signals through\u00a0signs\u00a0posted in the areas where pro-life speech is taking place that such speech is controversial and offensive, to be\u00a0possibly avoided\u00a0or protested.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A power of the purse veto involving biased use of student fees.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A threat of violence veto\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe matter has been filed in the United States District Court Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division.\u00a0Click here for a link to the case.\u00a0For interviews, contact Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201330\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Students for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages.

SFLA and SFLAction\u00a0have more conversations with those most targeted by the abortion industry than any other pro-life outreach in the world, reaching more than 2 million people across social media platforms each week and engaging in approximately 100,000 digital conversations per month. Over more than 15 years, President Kristan Hawkins has grown SFLAction/SFLA into an $18 million organization preparing for a Post-Roe America.\u00a0\u00a0Charitable Allies\u00a0is a non-profit legal aid law firm based in Indianapolis that provides affordable legal services and education to nonprofit organizations nationwide.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zac Kester can be reached at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,199\n\nShare this postKristi HamrickVice President of Media & Policy\nKristi Stone Hamrick, a well-known media consultant, strategist, writer, and commentator, is chief media strategist and spokesperson for Students for Life of America & Students for Life Action.BlogBlogrollSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
