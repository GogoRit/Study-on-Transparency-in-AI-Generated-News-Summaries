After delivering a coffin to Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau\u2019s doorstep, the caravan returned to Parliament where 36 women chained themselves to their seats in the public gallery, shouting \u201cAbortion on demand\u201d until the house was adjourned \u2013 the first time such a disruption had ever occurred. But it was not a moment that registered in the national consciousness. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t considered a significant event, a part of \u2018history,\u2019\u201d writes Karin Wells, who created a CBC Radio documentary about the Abortion Caravan in 2010 and who brings to her book a documentary maker\u2019s vivid characterization and exquisite attention to detail.\nWith engaging prose rich with humour, Wells sets the scene: a caravan of three vehicles, including a Volkswagen van with the coffin on top, first for the symbolism (between 1,000 and 2,000 women in Canada died each year from unsafe abortions) but also as a convenient place to store their sleeping bags. The women were all white and it never occurred to anyone at the time to wonder why Black and Indigenous women were missing. But otherwise this was a motley crew, each woman with a different background and motivation for taking part. They were united by the idea that Canada\u2019s abortion laws \u2013 abortions were subject to the approval of a committee \u2013 were as unjust as they were dangerous.\nWells shows that the caravan was a product of the political scene at Simon Fraser University but was also connected to a wave of student uprisings across Europe and the U.S., including the civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War. One perfect moment in the book has a caravan member going into a corner store for chocolate and cigarettes and reading news of the Kent State killings on the front page of the Sudbury Star.\nThe caravan grew in size as it crossed the prairies under RCMP surveillance, entering Ontario via the Trans-Canada Highway, which was still being paved. Along the way, it stopped in towns and cities, the women sleeping on church basement floors. (The United Church of Canada had been rallying around the abortion issue for a decade.) Typesetters were on strike that spring, so getting the word out through the newspapers was difficult, but news spread through grassroots organizing and phone trees.\nWhen officials refused to meet the caravan upon its arrival in Ottawa, the women decided to take over Parliament. Women working in MPs\u2019 offices forged passes so caravan members (poet Bronwen Wallace now among them) could enter the House of Commons, all of them costumed in \u201cmiddle-class\u201d clothing raided from local second-hand stores. It was a spectacle.\nFrom the vantage of 2020, it is easy to underestimate the significance of the Abortion Caravan. It took another 18 years for substantive change to Canada\u2019s abortion laws to take effect, and even today access to abortion remains a challenge in many parts of the country. But Wells\u2019s powerful book affirms that such ongoing obstacles to women\u2019s autonomy and reproductive rights are why the Abortion Caravan matters more than ever. \u201cWe needed brave, badly behaved women back then,\u201d she writes, \u201cand we always will.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nReviewer: Kerry Clare\nPublisher: Second Story Press\n\n\nDETAILS\nPrice: $24.95\nPage Count: 392 pp\nFormat: Paper\nISBN: 978-1-77260-125-1\nReleased: April\nIssue Date: May 2020\nCategories: History, Reviews\n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\nSend feedback to Q&Q editors about this review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Board\n\n\n\n\nProgram Consultant/Conseiller ou conseill\u00e8re en programmes\nToronto \n\n\n\n\nBookkeeper and Administrative Manager\nWindsor \n\n\n\n\nEditorial Project Manager \u2013 Specializing in Indigenous Language Projects\nToronto \n\n\n\n\nProduction Coordinator (Print)\nToronto \n\n\n\n\nMarketing Coordinator, Promotion and Publicity\nToronto \n\n\n\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse our anonymous tipline\nReport a book deal\nContact us via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nHome\nQuillblog\nBook reviews\nChildren\u2019s book reviews\nAuthor Profiles\nJob Board\nInternships\n \n\nQ&Q Omni\nIndustry News\nPersonnel changes\nAwards\nAnonymous tipline\n \n\nCustomer Service\nPublications\nSubscribe to Q&Q magazine\nManage my Digital Subscription\nAdvertising Rates & Specs\nPrivacy Policy\nAbout Us\nFAQ\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll content copyright Quill & Quire \u2014 Quill & Quire is a registered trademark of St. Joseph Media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
