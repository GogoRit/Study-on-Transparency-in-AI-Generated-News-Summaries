Subscribe to our daily newsletter.\nA Republican lawmaker in Florida has introduced a bill that would ban abortion past six weeks of pregnancy \u2014\u00a0legislation that, if passed, would effectively eliminate most abortion access in the South.\nRepublicans hold supermajorities in both the state\u2019s Senate and House of Delegates, and Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is visiting early primary states in advance of an expected presidential run, has vowed to sign any \u201cgreat life legislation.\u201d It\u2019s a commitment he reiterated when asked about a six-week ban, specifically.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six-week ban, introduced by Republican state Sen. Erin Grall on Tuesday, includes exceptions for rape or incest up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. To qualify, a person must have a copy of a restraining order, police report, medical record, or other court order or documentation proving the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. The legislation would also bar the use of state funds to help a pregnant person leave the state to obtain an abortion. The bill was introduced on the first day of Florida\u2019s legislative session.\nGrall\u2019s office declined to comment on the bill.\nAbortion is already outlawed in Florida for anyone past 15 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 a measure also introduced by Grall \u2014 with no exceptions for rape or incest. (There is a nominal exception to save the pregnant person\u2019s life, though doctors have said it is vague and difficult at best to utilize. Another exception exists if the fetus has a fatal anomaly, though it brings similar challenges.) It\u2019s a restriction that medical providers in the state note is not based on any medical reasoning. Though most abortions occur before 15 weeks, that law has still meaningfully curbed access, clinicians in the state say. Prior to the ban taking effect this past July, most Floridians who sought abortions past that point could not afford to come to a clinic earlier, were minors who in some cases did not realize they were pregnant, and people who discovered complications late in pregnancy \u2014 even if they were not guaranteed to be fatal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Explore our dashboard:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore our dashboard:\n\n                        What abortion looks like in every state \u2014 right now\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nA six-week ban could have a far more significant impact,\u00a0radiating far beyond Florida. People often do not know they are pregnant at six weeks. The first sign of pregnancy is often a missed menstrual period, which a pregnant person typically will not notice until they are around four weeks, at the earliest.\u00a0\nLaura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, criticized the bill, saying it would hurt people who get pregnant and their children, especially in Black and Latinx communities.\nThe bill \u201cmeans many pregnant people will never have the option to have an abortion,\u201d Goodhue said in a statement. \u201cMoreover, between the 24-hour mandatory delay and two appointment requirements, even patients who realize they are pregnant before six weeks may be unable to access abortion care before they run out of time.\u201d\nOther abortion rights groups also criticized the bill. \n\u201cIt is hugely problematic if Florida increases even more its limitations on access to abortion. It\u2019s the third largest state in the country. It\u2019s a place where people can travel from other states,\u201d said Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cIt\u2019s of huge concern.\u201d\nVice President Kamala Harris said she and President Joe Biden \u201care fighting back\u201d against such restrictions and took aim at Florida\u2019s GOP politicians.\n\u201cThese extremist so-called leaders talk a lot about freedom, while they dare to attack its very foundations,\u201d Harris said in a tweet.\nThe vice president spoke in the state capitol of Tallahassee in January to mark the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which the Supreme Court reversed in June. Last year\u2019s decision left the legality of abortion up to the states, limiting what the administration can do to impact access. \nStill, some anti-abortion organizations criticized the Florida bill as insufficient.\n\u201cThere is a lot of room for loopholes \u2026 We will continue to work with legislators to strengthen this bill while introducing others,\u201d Kristan Hawkins, the head of Students for Life, said in a tweet.\nIn the months since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the Sunshine State has emerged as a haven for people in the South seeking abortion. The procedure is outlawed almost completely in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas and banned after six weeks in Georgia. That limits abortion access in the South to Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina, where a six-week ban was struck down by the state Supreme Court last year.\nNone of the three providers in South Carolina performs abortion past 14 weeks. About a dozen abortion clinics operate in North Carolina, where close to 30,000 abortions took place in 2020. In Florida, the nation\u2019s third-largest state, more than 60 clinics provide abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More Florida abortion coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    In Florida, 1 in 10 minors are denied abortions by judges\n                \n\n\n\n                    What Ron DeSantis\u2019 budding presidential bid could mean for Florida abortion laws\n                \n\n\n\n                    Kamala Harris, in Florida, takes aim at abortion restrictions as attacking \u2018the very foundations of freedom\u2019\n                \n\n\n\n\nAlready, Florida\u2019s large network of clinics has seen a surge in patients. Last year alone, 6,708 people from out of state got an abortion in Florida, about 8 percent of the 82,192 abortions done there. That represents a 37.7 percent increase in out-of-state abortions from 2021. Abortion clinics, particularly in northern Florida, which is closer to the Georgia border, have said they are seeing twice as many patients as before, with a large share coming from out of state.\u00a0\nIf a six-week ban passes in Florida, it will likely end the state\u2019s status as a refuge, creating too short a timeframe for people from out of state \u2014 who, upon learning they are pregnant, typically need to find a clinic, make an appointment, and coordinate money and logistics for travel, lodging and potentially child care. Those efforts can take weeks, as seen last year when Texas and Oklahoma both enforced six-week abortion bans even prior to Roe\u2019s overturn.\u00a0\nThat would put more pressure on clinics in the Carolinas, but it\u2019s unclear how long abortion will stay legal there. In South Carolina, which is governed by a Republican trifecta, lawmakers are working to pass a new ban on the procedure. A change in makeup of the state\u2019s Supreme Court \u2014\u00a0the loss of its sole woman justice, who had voted to strike down the state\u2019s six-week ban \u2014 could increase the odds of an abortion prohibition being upheld.\nIn North Carolina, the state\u2019s Democratic governor has indicated he would veto an abortion ban. But statehouse Republicans are one vote shy of a veto-proof majority,\u00a0and one Democratic legislator has suggested openness to voting for some kind of abortion ban.
