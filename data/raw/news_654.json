Wade, the national Supreme Court decision that said abortion was legal nationwide.\n\nA physician accused of \u201ccausing or inducing an abortion\u201d would face an official charge of \u201ccriminal abortion,\u201d which would be a fourth-degree felony under the new Senate Bill, introduced recently in the Ohio Senate.\n\nIf signed into law, the bill would not take into effect until either the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the 1973 decision in Roe. V. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide, or an amendment to the U.S. Constitution \u201cupholds Ohio\u2019s authority under the federal system to prohibit abortion,\u201d according to a statement from bill cosponsor state Sen. Kristina Roegner\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI believe that when the U.S. Supreme Court considers a challenge to Roe, they will realize that the original decision from 1973 was seriously flawed, and return the authority regarding abortion to the states,\u201d Roegner said in the statement.\n\nNearly a year ago to the day, former state Rep. John Becker introduced similar legislation, which would have barred state funds from being disbursed for abortion-related services and created a first-degree felony charge of \u201cabortion manslaughter.\u201d\n\nBecker\u2019s bill never received a hearing, and therefore never moved in the 133rd General Assembly. Currently, abortions are legal in Ohio up to 22 weeks gestation.\n\nBoth bills have an exception in the event that \u201cthe abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman,\u201d according to language in the current bill.\n\nOhio is one of a few states trying to pass anti-abortion laws and create a review of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe abortion fight in the state has been going on since Roe v. Wade was decided, but a law professor who also works on abortion challenges says the last few years have been more active than most.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s almost nothing that\u2019s beyond the pale right now,\u201d said Professor Jessie Hill of Case Western Reserve University.\n\nHill is also cooperating attorney for the ACLU, which has five lawsuits against state abortion measures going on simultaneously, including one filed this week challenging a law on burial and cremation after surgical abortions. Since Hill returned to Ohio in 2001, she\u2019s only seen efforts to regulate abortion ramp up year after year.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden these bills started passing, and in the last few years they\u2019ve been more and more extreme,\u201d Hill said, adding that gerrymandering creating a Republican-leaning legislature contributed to the increase in anti-abortion legislation.\n\nAnti-abortion groups are lining up to support the bill, with lobby group Ohio Right to Life calling the legislation \u201cpowerful and life-affirming.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time since abortion was legalized, we have a pro-life majority on the (U.S.) Supreme Court,\u201d said Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life. \u201cRoe v. Wade hangs by a thread. Ohio must be prepared for what comes next.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Ohio chapter said the newest bill restricts access to care rather than making lives better.\n\n\u201cS.B. 123 is the latest egregious attack on abortion access from leaders in the Ohio General Assembly who are only focused on eliminating legal access to abortion, to the neglect of everything else \u2013 including the pandemic.\u201d\n\nHill sees a constitutional amendment as a long shot, with a requirement of support from 75% of states in order to make that happen.\n\nTargeting a U.S. Supreme Court decision is a bigger possibility, and even if the high court decides not to overturn the decision as a whole, Hill says cutting back the protections included in Roe v. Wade is something not often considered as the debate continues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an under-appreciated possibility that the court is not really interested in overturning Roe v. Wade, but that they would reduce it to almost nothing,\u201d Hill said.\n\nThe new Ohio bill will now be assigned to a House committee for hearings and consideration.\n\nOriginally published by the Ohio Capital Journal.
