Russo. Photo by Robin Bravender \nIn a major victory for reproductive rights, the U.S. Supreme Court, on Monday, struck down a controversial Louisiana law that critics said would have severely limited access to abortion in Louisiana and opened the door to further abortion limitations around the country.\nEnacted in 2014 by the Louisiana state Legislature, the law would have required physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.\nA district court overturned the law in 2017 on the grounds that it offers no benefits to women\u2019s health that justify the burdens it places on abortion access, but a federal appellate court reversed the decision in 2018.\nThe high court sided with the lower district court, ruling that its findings and underlying evidence support its conclusion that the law would \u201cdrastically reduce\u201d access to abortion and make it impossible for many women to obtain a safe, legal abortion in the state.\nThe court also noted that the law is \u201cnearly identical\u201d to a similar Texas law that the court struck down in 2016. In that case \u2014 Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt \u2014 the court found that the law posed an undue burden on access to abortion.\nHouse Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) applauded the court\u2019s decision.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for women\u2019s reproductive freedom in our country, which has been under assault by Republican efforts to limit women\u2019s access to health care by forcing the closure of facilities that provide that care,\u201d Hoyer said in statement.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision recognizes that Roe v. Wade continues to protect women\u2019s constitutional right to make decisions about their own reproductive health care and to access care,\u201d Hoyer added.\nThe decision comes on the heels of two recent rulings in which the conservative-tilting court\u2019s four liberal justices won the day. Earlier this month, a majority of the court backed LGBTQ workplace rights and blocked a Trump administration program that threatened young, unauthorized immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d with deportation.\nWriting for the majority in June Medical Services v. Russo, Justice Stephen Breyer said the district court\u2019s findings \u201cmirror\u201d the Whole Woman\u2019s Health case \u201cin every relevant respect and require the same result.\u201d Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan agreed.\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote a concurring opinion, citing the legal doctrine of stare decisis \u2014 the principle that obligates courts to follow previous rulings in similar cases.\nRoberts joined the court\u2019s conservative wing in its 2016 dissent in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, arguing that the Texas law should have been upheld. In joining the court\u2019s liberals Monday, he wrote that the question \u201cis not whether Whole Woman\u2019s Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case.\u201d\nStare decisis, he said, requires justices to \u201ctreat like cases alike,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons. Therefore Louisiana\u2019s law cannot stand under our precedents.\u201d\nConservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh filed dissenting opinions in the case.\nHouse Republican Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, whose district includes most of New Orleans\u2019 suburbs, called the decision \u201ca major step backwards\u201d and vowed to keep fighting. \u201cToday\u2019s decision reminds us how much work we still have to do in our efforts to protect the unborn and defend the sanctity of life. We will not back down or relent,\u201d he said.\nAdvocates for reproductive rights, however, cheered the decision, calling it a \u201cwin\u201d for Louisianans.\n\u201cWe are relieved that the Supreme Court followed facts and precedent to strike down the state\u2019s harmful anti-abortion law,\u201d Herminia Palacio, president and CEO of the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice think tank, said in a statement.\nBut she warned that abortion access is still at risk, pointing to a \u201cdecades-long, coordinated campaign\u201d to restrict access to abortion across the country, including recent efforts to do so amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2017, 89 percent of U.S. counties had no clinics providing abortions, according to the institute.\nNancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which litigated the case on behalf of June Medical Services \u2014 the corporate name of the clinic in Shreveport, La., that was at the center of the case \u2014 echoed the sentiment. The clinic is one of three clinics that offer abortion services in the state.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Court\u2019s ruling today will not stop those hell-bent on banning abortion,\u201d Northup said in a statement. \u201cWe will be back in court tomorrow and will continue to fight state by state, law by law to protect our constitutional right to abortion.\u201d\n[email\u00a0protected]\nRepublish \n\n\n\nTags:\nBrett KavanaughCenter for Reproductive RightsClarence ThomasGuttmacher InstituteHerminia PalacioJohn RobertsJune Medical Services v.
