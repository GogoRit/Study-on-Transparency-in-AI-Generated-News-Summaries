(WCSC/AP) - For the second time since the U.S. Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections, the South Carolina House has passed a near-total abortion ban \u2014 and shows no sign of budging.The lower chamber\u2019s Republican supermajority on Wednesday continued its efforts to make South Carolina the 13th state with a ban from conception. By a 83-31 vote largely along party lines, the House advanced a bill including exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and the patient\u2019s health and life.A long road awaits any abortion restriction before it reaches the governor\u2019s desk. Republican lawmakers in the conservative state have\u00a0failed to agree\u00a0on when exactly pregnancy can be legally terminated. A special session last year proved a vain attempt to restrict abortion after the two chambers could not reconcile vastly different bills.The stalemate persisted Wednesday.According to the S.C. House Republican Caucus, this is a \u201cmajor win\u201d and the \u201cmost advanced pro-life legislation in our state\u2019s history.\u201dThis bill is different from the six-week ban the Senate passed earlier this month. That being said, the two chambers will still need to come to a compromise.This house bill is called the Human Life Protection Act. Its intention is to prohibit anyone from knowingly providing drugs to a pregnant woman that could cause an abortion, unless it is during an emergency situation. Some of these circumstances include incidents of rape or incest, when a fatal fetal anomaly is present or when the life of the mother is at risk.Representative John McCravy, the sponsor of the bill, says this bill \u201csends a message that the days of abortion as birth control are drawing to an end, and it is now time for our pro-life Senators to keep their word and vote to pass this bill.\u201dContraceptives, IVF and other assistive reproductive technologies are not prohibited. Additionally, the biological father would be liable for paying 50% of the birth mother\u2019s pregnancy from the time of conception and child support moving forward.The bill also requires physicians who end a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest to report the allegation to the local sheriff within 24 hours of the abortion.The bill explicitly states that it does not criminalize patients who receive an abortion. But the proposal allows the patient, a minor\u2019s legal guardians, a solicitor or the state\u2019s attorney general to sue others who illegally end a pregnancy. Plaintiffs could receive damages of $10,000 for each violation.\u201cThere is a legislative process that we go through. And there\u2019s conference committees and there\u2019s negotiations between parties,\u201d Speaker Murrell Smith said. \u201cBut at this point the House simply didn\u2019t have the votes to pass the \u2018heartbeat\u2019 bill.\u201dContrary to Senate Republicans\u2019 insistence otherwise, Smith said the House version is the only proposal that could withstand legal scrutiny.The opinion of one justice in the abortion decision\u2019s three-person majority has served as a lodestar for Republicans seeking to craft an abortion ban that passes constitutional muster. Justice John Few suggested that the right to life might outweigh the right to privacy if the General Assembly determined that human life begins at conception. By passing an abortion ban from conception, Smith expressed confidence that Few\u2019s vote would flip.For one of the General Assembly\u2019s most vocal abortion opponents, the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision has shifted the goal posts. Republican Rep. John McCravy said he designed the state\u2019s previous so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat bill\u201d to tempt the U.S. Supreme Court into doing exactly what it did last summer: overturning Roe v. Wade. With that roadblock removed, McCravy said lawmakers need to go beyond their previous efforts.\u201cWe\u2019re in a new position now,\u201d McCravy said. \u201cWe\u2019re not drafting a bill to try to tease the United States Supreme Court. We\u2019re drafting a bill for South Carolina.\u201dWednesday\u2019s debate divided the measure\u2019s leading proponent and one of the chamber\u2019s most conservative members. McCravy successfully tabled multiple amendments from fellow Republican Rep. Josiah Magnuson that would have removed exceptions for rape and incest. While he personally shared Magnuson\u2019s opposition to those exceptions, McCravy said their inclusion was necessary to pass the bill.Magnuson put forth another failed amendment allowing someone who intentionally gets an abortion to be charged with a misdemeanor punishable by two years in prison and a $5,000 fine. McCravy said lawmakers should \u201cfall down on the side of mercy and not criminalize women.\u201dRepublicans also removed the ability for a family court to grant abortion rights to minors without their legal guardians\u2019 knowledge.They also rejected several Democratic amendments. Rep. Heather Bauer \u2014 a first-year member who flipped her Columbia-area seat in a campaign centered on abortion rights \u2014 tried to remove what she called an \u201carchaic\u201d 1974 law criminalizing people who attempt self-managed abortions. While the Senate voted to remove the statute last week, the House did not.Bauer and Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter also proposed several processes similar to this fall\u2019s Kansas referendum, when voters in the conservative state\u00a0overwhelmingly protected abortion access. House Republicans dismissed the effort as futile because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote from each chamber \u2014 something the GOP-majority General Assembly would never do.Theological debate also broke out several times between Christians on both sides of the aisle who all claimed biblical support for their different positions.House Democrats criticized their Republican counterparts for pushing laws they said would worsen maternal mortality and teen pregnancy rates and drive OBGYNs away from a state already lacking in all those areas.\u201cYear after year, we don\u2019t debate bills intended to improve the health outcomes for women and children,\u201d Rep. Spencer Wetmore said at a Tuesday press conference. \u201cInstead, we spend months of every legislative session debating how we can restrict the reproductive rights of women.\u201dThis bill still has to go through a third reading before it can officially pass the House and head to the Senate.Read the full press release from the S.C.
