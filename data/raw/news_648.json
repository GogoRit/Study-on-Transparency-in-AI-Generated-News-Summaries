The bill has already passed the Senate and the House and is now waiting on Gov. Asa Hutchinson\u2019s signature.Pro-choice protestors wore red cloaks and white hats seen in 'The Handmaid's Tale,' a popular novel and TV show in which right-wing extremists have taken over the U.S. and women\u2019s rights are severely restricted.\"Senate Bill 6 will kill women,\" the protester said. \"It will, because they will go to back alleys to get an abortion. They will take rat poison or any chemicals that they can to eliminate an unwanted pregnancy and it\u2019s just unacceptable.\"Aly Taylor is the co-founder and president of Arkansas Abortion Support Network and she sees SB6 as denying women healthcare.\"This is such a deeply personal decision that the government has no business [interfering with],\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI believe that every person has the right to make their own decision about pregnancy, birth or parenting.\"State Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, is one of the co-sponsors of the bill, along with Rep. Jason Rapert, R-Conway. KATV asked Bentley what she would say to the women who see this bill as restricting women\u2019s access to healthcare.\u201cI just don\u2019t think murdering a baby has access to healthcare and that\u2019s just my heart and I know that we have a huge support,\" Bentley said. \"This is the most pro-life state in the nation.\" Bentley said regardless of your belief in god, she sees abortion as killing a human life.\u201cWe understand people\u2019s heartache over rape and incest, but we do have the morning-after pill,\" Bentley said. \"We do have things now that we didn\u2019t have in 1973 as far as emergency contraceptive goes.\"Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\u00a9 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ..."
