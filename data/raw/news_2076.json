Instead, the law bans people from committing feticide, or killing a fetus, usually \u201cby assaulting and battering the mother\u201d, the Dane county judge Diane Schlipper wrote in her July ruling. \u2018The future of abortion is tenuous\u2019: relief and fear in Iowa as ban blockedRead more\u201cThere is no such thing as an \u20181849 Abortion Ban\u2019 in Wisconsin,\u201d Schlipper ruled.The recommencement of services marks a massive victory for abortion rights supporters in Wisconsin, where abortion providers stopped performing the procedure amid the confusion over the 1849 law. It also promises to ease the strain on abortion patients across the midwest, since a blanket of abortion bans has choked off access for patients in the region and sent many fleeing to overwhelmed abortion clinics on the coasts.Tony Evers, the Democratic governor of Wisconsin, hailed Planned Parenthood\u2019s decision.\u201cThis is critically important news for Wisconsin women and patients across our state who, for a year now, have been unable to access the healthcare they need when and where they need it,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will keep fighting like hell every day until Wisconsinites have the right to make their own healthcare decisions without interference from politicians who don\u2019t know anything about their lives, their family, or their circumstances.\u201dLitigation over the 1849 ban is ongoing. It is expected to ultimately end up at the Wisconsin supreme court, which is controlled by liberals.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWisconsinReproductive rightsPlanned ParenthoodHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
