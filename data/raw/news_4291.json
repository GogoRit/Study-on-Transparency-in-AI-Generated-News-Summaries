There were Senate hearings, court cases, religious commissions, and innumerable disagreements over its role in medicine and in culture. In the six decades since, sales of the pill have ebbed and flowed, even as it\u2019s endured as the most popular form of birth control for women aged 15 to 49, and a slew of other contraceptive methods have come to the market. Yet, the debate around birth control\u2014particularly its affordability and accessibility\u2014is still alive and well.\n\n\nNearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, but 43% of young women remain uninformed about birth control before becoming sexually active, and education about and access to contraceptives are even more lacking among low-income populations. However, Amy Fan and Twentyeight Health, the reproductive and sexual health start-up she co-founded, are hoping to change that.\n\nSince the company launched in 2018, it\u2019s expanded to five states and has aided countless women in getting birth control easily and affordably. The COVID-19 pandemic has given a new rise to the power of telemedicine, and Twentyeight Health has seen more demand for its services than ever before\u2014but Fan thinks the trend will long outlast the virus, and she believes her platform will help address the new and expanding needs of women\u2019s health for many years to come.\n\nTwentyeight Health founder Amy FanTwentyeight Health\nGabby Shacknai: What specific problems does Twentyeight Health hope to address and how?\n\nAmy Fan: There are so many barriers women face to get reproductive and sexual care, and it\u2019s exacerbated for women from underserved communities. For example, we have a real user who is a student at a community college in the Bronx and has Medicaid. Theoretically, Medicaid has good coverage of contraceptives, so it should be easy for her to get birth control, right? What\u2019s not taken into consideration is all the other realities of her life. Only 17 states require sex ed to be medically-accurate, which means that she may not be equipped with resources about what her birth control options are and how to get them. Additionally, one in three doctors does not accept new Medicaid patients, and her specific school doesn\u2019t have enough funding to have a clinician who can prescribe at the student wellness center. Patients from low income commonly cite transportation and being unable to step away from other obligations, such as school, work, and caregiving, as reasons why they miss appointments. Simply put, the cards are stacked against her and so many like her.\nMORE FOR YOU 300 Billion Crypto Price Crash Suddenly Accelerates As Bitcoin  Ethereum And XRP Traders Brace For A Fed ShockApple\u2019s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like SamsungNew Gmail Security Rules You Have 14 Days To Comply  Google Says\nWhat we want to do at Twentyeight Health is to make it simple to get reproductive and sexual health services. Through telemedicine, users can easily sign up and message or call a doctor while they are on their lunch break. We also provide medication delivery, so our users will always get their medication on time, regardless of what life throws at them. Our team strives to work as advocates for our users, helping them navigate insurance and understand all the options available to them.\n\nThis is a key piece that we focus on with Twentyeight Health \u2014 affordability. We are the only player that accepts Medicaid in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and soon, Florida! Medicaid has good coverage of many reproductive and sexual services, and we are providing the link to providing high quality healthcare that is accessible to women in need.\n\n\nShacknai: What inspired you to create Twentyeight Health?\nFan: I was pursuing a MBA and Masters of Public Health at University of California, Berkeley, and coming from Canada, it was eye-opening to understand the inner workings of the U.S. healthcare system. Payers, providers, pharmaceutical companies, PBMs\u2014there are so many healthcare stakeholders that start with P, yet patients are often the last piece considered.\nHaving experienced first hand the difficulties of navigating the American healthcare system, where I was not able to see a OB-GYN for over 2 years because my insurance coverage changed and it was so difficult to find a doctor accepting new patients in-network, and then seeing the challenges that many patients face across the board, I wanted to find a better way for individuals to get needed healthcare services. As luck would have it, I was introduced to my cofounder, who had led Market Access in Family Planning, Malaria, and HIV at the Gates Foundation. We discussed the potential of telemedicine as he shared his experiences in developing markets, where he had seen the power of telemedicine to overcome lack of infrastructure and stigma and to deliver reproductive and sexual health services. Seeing the situation in the U.S., where over 19 million women live in contraceptive deserts and the maternal mortality rate is two times higher for women from low income, we wanted to leverage telemedicine to solve the opposite problem, where there\u2019s so much bureaucracy that it\u2019s become a barrier to care.\nShacknai: What is the story behind Twentyeight Health\u2019s name?\nFan: Twentyeight Health alludes to the 28 days of an average menstrual cycle!Twentyeight Health\nShacknai: What services does the platform currently offer?\nFan: Starting with birth control, we\u2019ve built an end-to-end platform providing telemedicine, medication delivery, and ongoing care. Currently, we offer over 100 brands of birth control pills, patch, ring, and emergency contraception. We accept insurance\u2014and importantly, Medicaid\u2014and offer a low out-of-pocket price for users without insurance. We also partner with Bedsider\u2019s BCBenefits to provide free birth control to uninsured women in need.\nShacknai: What process would a Twentyeight Health user seeking birth control typically go through?\nFan: It\u2019s very easy. Step one is a simple online visit. The user fills out the five-minute-long medical questionnaire for a new or renewed prescription for birth control pill, patch, ring, and emergency contraception. There\u2019s an option to schedule a phone consultation with a doctor.\nStep two is free, fast delivery. After the doctor writes a prescription, it is delivered in one to three business days.\nStep three is ongoing care. We provide unlimited doctor follow-up messages\u2014whether it is to discuss updating your prescription, solving for side effects, or anything else. Our team supports the user along every step, whether it\u2019s answering questions about their insurance, helping them understand their coverage, or advocating for their needs. From a public health perspective, the ongoing care piece is very important. We want to ensure that women can easily access a trusted medical professional who can help find the best birth control option for them as their lifestyle or situation changes.\nShacknai: What is Twentyeight Health\u2019s relationship with doctors?\nFan: We work with board-certified doctors who are passionate about women's health and based in the U.S. We built Twentyeight Health to bring more healthcare options to women, and it\u2019s been interesting to learn that this also creates flexible roles for clinicians. We\u2019ve interviewed several doctors who have told us they are interested in telemedicine because it gives them more agency over their schedules, whether it is to spend more time with their kids, to take care of aging parents, or to live where they want to.\nShacknai: What have been the biggest challenges in launching and growing the platform?\nFan: The U.S. healthcare system is a big hairy beast. It\u2019s complex, and it\u2019s regulated, but it\u2019s also incredibly important. This means that understanding the regulatory components are crucial. Many healthcare policies are regulated at a state level, which means with each state we enter, we need to to ensure our operations, business model, and partnership agreements comply.\nThe tech mantra of \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 doesn\u2019t work in healthcare because we are dealing with people\u2019s lives. We invested in building a rigorous and secure platform, and collaborated with our medical advisors to ensure we are providing a top notch medical care. Additionally, user experience is one of the metrics we measure closely because we want to create a high-quality experience where users feel heard and supported.Twentyeight Health\nShacknai: What are your long-term goals for Twentyeight Health?\nFan: Our vision is to create a comprehensive women\u2019s health platform that supports women through different life stages, expanding to fertility, pre- and postnatal, and menopause. We see telemedicine as complementary to in-person care, and in the future, we will partner with offline providers to create a seamless experience for users. We are excited to expand high quality women\u2019s health access to as many as possible!\nShacknai: Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has meant decreased or no in-office access to doctors, and as unemployment numbers rise, it means fewer women have health insurance to cover their birth control. How can Twentyeight Health help address some of these problems?\nFan: We\u2019ve seen a significant increase in demand for Twentyeight since the start of COVID. With shelter-in-place, many individuals are leveraging telemedicine to seek healthcare services. Telemedicine adoption had been stagnant for several years, accounting for about 10% of all medicine at the end of 2019. COVID-19 has dramatically changed this, with telemedicine adoption forecasted to be 22% by the end of June.\nDuring the crisis, we want to ensure that all women who want birth control can continue to access it. To lower the barriers further, we have waived the doctor evaluation fees for everyone coming to our platform. Additionally, we are helping women navigate their insurance to get more birth control with their next delivery. Many insurance companies have updated their policies during COVID-19, and we\u2019ve been able to help nearly 15% more of our users get 12 months of birth control with their next delivery. This is not only helpful in providing security during a level of uncertainty, but it is also provides a safety net for women who might be worried about losing their insurance coverage. We recognize many people have lost their jobs due to the health pandemic, which is why it is even more important that we accept Medicaid. Medicaid has no specific enrollment period, which means that individuals can apply at any time.\nShacknai: What do you think Twentyeight Health\u2019s role in a post-pandemic world will be?\nFan: For the first time during the pandemic, many of us are experiencing the barriers to healthcare that underserved communities have always faced. I hope we can all recognize the importance of providing convenient, affordable, and high-quality healthcare for everyone and that this need will last beyond the pandemic. We will continue to expand access to reproductive and sexual healthcare for underserved women and revolutionize healthcare delivery to create dignified, empowering patient experiences.\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0Gabby ShacknaiEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
