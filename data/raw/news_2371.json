Some were too far along in the abortion to be helped. Others never called back. One decided to proceed with the abortion anyway.\nBut Mariah\u2019s story ended differently, thanks to the Abortion Pill Reversal protocol, a treatment which uses the natural hormone progesterone to maintain a healthy pregnancy.\nBecause of Mariah\u2019s quick call to the Abortion Pill Rescue helpline (877-558-0333), Daniels was able to get her started on the treatment immediately.\u00a0\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nOver the course of the next several weeks, Daniels would monitor Mariah\u2019s blood levels and check in on her baby via obstetrical ultrasound scans, ensuring that both mom and baby were healthy and thriving. Once Mariah reached the second trimester, she transferred to another doctor for regular prenatal care, keeping in contact with Daniels throughout her pregnancy.\nThen, a few months ago, Mariah gave birth to her baby boy, making him one of more than 900 children rescued by Abortion Pill Reversal.\u00a0\nAs a show of gratitude, Mariah visited Daniels with baby-in-tow.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very healthy, very cute,\u201d Daniels told Pregnancy Help News. \u201cDevelopmentally, he was completely normal. No major issues.\u201d\nDaniels says that although the father isn\u2019t very supportive, Mariah is doing well, too.\n\u201cShe really, really wanted women to know that this (Abortion Pill Reversal) was something that they could act on,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThey could change their mind. They could access this program.\u201d\nWith that in mind, Mariah gave Daniels permission to post an anonymous photo of Daniels and her son on the doctor\u2019s Facebook page.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAPR baby/Poppy Daniels Facebook\n\n\u201cThis is a very special day,\u201d Daniels wrote. \u201cThis is the first successful medical abortion reversal that I have had the honor of participating in. I have been a Progesterone expert for many years & knew that progesterone could reverse the effects of RU-486/mifepristone if it was instituted quickly. We are respecting mom\u2019s privacy by keeping it anonymous but she wanted me to share her story & pictures in the hopes that it could encourage other women who take the abortion pill & regret it or change their minds. In her case, she is so happy she instantly knew that she didn\u2019t want to go through with it & called the Abortion Pill Reversal hotline who connected her with me. She has chosen to parent & as she said \u2018I knew everything would end up working out.\u2019 A true #miraclebaby. #happytears\u201d\nSpeaking from experience\nFrom the beginning, the Abortion Pill Rescue Network seemed like a natural fit for Daniels.\u00a0\nFor the majority of her career, she has specialized in using bioidentical hormones like progesterone to assist women experiencing fertility issues.\u00a0\nHaving learned about the use of bioidentical progesterone through the esteemed NaProTechnology of Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, she has become thoroughly familiar with the use of the hormone to support pregnancies.\nWith that experience in her back pocket, she joined the Abortion Pill Rescue Network in 2014, joining hundreds of other medical providers in the effort to save babies, as well as their mothers, from the devastation of abortion.\nNow operated by Heartbeat International, the network and 24/7 helpline (877-558-0333) consists of more than 800 providers.\nWith their vast medical knowledge and passion, many of these providers are speaking out alongside Daniels, sharing the stories of the hundreds of babies rescued by the reversal treatment.\nGeorge Delgado and Matt Harrison, the pioneers of Abortion Pill Reversal, were the first ones to blaze that trail. Now, William Lile, Brent Boles and others are regularly telling their stories, sharing pictures of the babies they\u2019ve helped rescue all across the internet.\nDaniels\u2019s post, which she made last month (Nov. 2019), quickly gained traction with over 4,000 likes and over 1,000 shares on Facebook.\nThe post\u2019s popularity reflects the importance of social media in Daniels\u2019s larger efforts to stand up and be a voice for the voiceless within the medical community.\u00a0\nConsidering the abortion industry\u2019s control of the media and popular medical institutions, she says, that\u2019s difficult.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the abortion side has way more visibility on social media and the mainstream media, which is how they control the narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cThose of us who are on the frontlines, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a drop in the bucket. But I do believe that with social media, that has been able to elevate more pro-life messages than ever before. As much as they try to censor us, you can\u2019t because of the nature of the forum.\u201d\nStanding up\nDaniels, who has served as a practicing OB-GYN for the last 17 years, says she has always been pro-life.\u00a0\n\u201cReally, it didn\u2019t seem like it was that unusual to be an OB-GYN doctor and pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of it as treating mother and baby, treating two patients. And so that\u2019s just always been part of who I am.\u201d\nBut Daniels realizes she is a bit of an anomaly.\n\u201cFor the most part, a lot of OB-GYNs do not talk about being pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have always talked about being pro-life, and I think that it\u2019s just a thing that I feel very strongly about. I haven\u2019t always been conservative. I used to be pretty liberal. But even when I was very liberal, I was not for abortion. I was always pro-life, even as a liberal.\u201d\nAs an outspoken pro-life medical practitioner, she says there are plenty of threats that squelch the voices of her peers.\n\u201cThe reason more people don\u2019t (speak out), is because, of course, you get backlash,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like anything else, if you stand up and you speak up, then you\u2019re going to be attacked. And some of it\u2019s just trolls and stupid stuff, but professionally, there\u2019s some people online that are \u2018so-called professionals\u2019 and they\u2019re brutal and they will go after you... That\u2019s just the way they do it. That\u2019s their tactic. They will try to discredit you however they can.\u201d\u00a0\nThe intolerance of the pro-abortion medical community has left many physicians feeling ostracized.\n\u201cThey (abortion advocates) are everywhere, they have infiltrated every aspect of all of the major academic centers, all of the mainstream medical journals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re all pro-abortion. Which is why I left ACOG, why I\u2019m not paying dues to ACOG. Because they don\u2019t represent me.\u201d\nInstead, Daniels is a member of the American Association of Pro-life OB-GYNs (AAPLOG), a group of more than 2,500 members and associates.\nRecently, Daniels sounded off on ACOG\u2019s pro-abortion biases on Facebook, poking holes in an extraordinarily flawed study the group published this month on Abortion Pill Reversal.\nIn that study, pro-abortion researcher Mitchell Creinin set out to determine whether the reversal protocol is actually as ineffective as he believes.\n\u201cThis doctor intended to study 40 women,\u201d wrote Daniels. \u201cThey were going to give women who took the first abortion pill and then given them either progesterone or a placebo. If the baby survived, they would be offered a surgical abortion two weeks later. They only enrolled 12 patients, 2 dropped out. 5 received progesterone [the abortion pill reversal treatment] and 5 received placebo. One patient who took progesterone went to the ER but needed no intervention. 4 had continuing pregnancies. 2 patients who took placebo went to the ER, one had a D&C and one required blood. 2 patients had (continuing) pregnancy. So let\u2019s recap! This is an insanely small sample size & wouldn\u2019t have been published by most except the most ideological journal. Those who took the abortion pill had significant bleeding! That points to the riskiness of the abortion pill! But that\u2019s not what the headlines said.\u201d\nBased on the study\u2019s complete failure, Daniels couldn\u2019t believe ACOG published it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 \u2018Are you kidding me? This is not science,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut when your buddies in the mainstream media are willing to write whatever headlines you tell them to write because they\u2019re on your side, they\u2019re not trying to be objective in any way. So it\u2019s laughable. It\u2019s laughable, and yet, they\u2019re going to keep doing it...unless there\u2019s more people like me that will speak out and say, \u2018This is ridiculous, and you people are lying, and you\u2019re biased and you don\u2019t care about women, you just care about money, honestly.\u2019\u201d\nDaniels says that providing a woman with progesterone costs all of $40\u2060\u2014a small fraction of the cost of a chemical abortion, which can reach up to $1,000.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making money off of this,\u201d she said of Abortion Pill Reversal. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we believe it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cWe\u2019re not making money off of this (Abortion Pill Reversal). We\u2019re doing it because we believe it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d \nFor women like Mariah and babies like her son, that commitment is both life-changing and life-saving.\n\u201cThis is a real person,\u201d Daniels said of Mariah. \u201cThis really happened. She really did access the program and it really did work. And now her baby\u2019s here and everything is fine.\u201d\u00a0\nEditor's note: The Abortion Pill Rescue Network is managed by Heartbeat International, which also manages Pregnancy Help News. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nAPR\nabortion pill reversal\nAbortion Pill Rescue Network\nAPRN\nDr Poppy Daniels\nMitchell Creinin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Franklin\n\nKatie Franklin is a writer for Heartbeat International.
