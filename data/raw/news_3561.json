In Texas, pastors are boarding planes with groups of pregnant women and accompanying them to abortion clinics out of state. In Washington, D.C., a century-old Jewish nonprofit is shifting hundreds of thousands of dollars to abortion funds.\nAcross the U.S., as state legislatures restrict reproductive health care in increasingly draconian ways, progressive faith communities are pushing back.\nSome faith leaders have mobilized teams of volunteers to directly assist people seeking abortions. Others are taking steps toward a more vocal, affirming approach to the issue after decades of near-silence\u2014determined to wrest away the hold that the Christian right has had on the dominant narrative of religion and abortion.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nRev. Charles Owens, a 34-year-old pastor at a United Church of Christ church in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, rarely preached about abortion before Roe v. Wade was overturned. But in June, after the Supreme Court decision, he stood in front of a congregation of more than 100 people and asked them to keep the country in their prayers. \u201cThere are women right now who are pregnant who\u2014they will die, because pregnancy has endangered their life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they could have received a treatment that saved their life, but not anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re recognizing, now, we do need to do\u00a0more.\u201d\n\n      \u2014\n      Pastor Charles\u00a0Owens\n    \n\nJesus never spoke a word on \u201cthe unborn,\u201d Owens pointed out in an online essay. Paul the Apostle, a prolific social commentator in the Bible who shared his own views on myriad matters of moral concern\u2014from the permissibility of dancing to the proper length of human hair\u2014had nothing to say on botanical remedies that were used for unwanted pregnancies in his time. \u201cIf abortion really is against God\u2019s will and the life of a fetus sacred,\u201d Owens wrote, \u201cwhy would scripture be silent on such a critical issue?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nOwens\u2019 church already has a volunteer group that organizes service and social advocacy projects. They\u2019ve protested anti-transgender bills, provided furniture for Ukrainian refugees settling in Sioux Falls, and held an entrepreneurial fair for local immigrants who were victims of human trafficking. Now, Owens wants to extend the group\u2019s services to neighbors who need abortions. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot we\u2019ve done about reproductive justice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re recognizing, now, we do need to do more.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July, Owens joined representatives from a few dozen United Church of Christ congregations in Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota for a virtual training through the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, an interfaith nonprofit. For 90 minutes, pastors and lay members discussed what various religious texts actually say\u2014and do not say\u2014about pregnancy and reproductive health care. They also learned about the history of the anti-abortion movement in the U.S. and received suggestions for how their churches might support people seeking abortions in places where such care is, or may soon become, illegal, as it is in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group that organized the training has a long history of putting faith leaders to work when abortion is criminalized. It grew out of a prominent network of clergy who helped pregnant women in the U.S. get safe abortions in the years before Roe v. Wade.\nPreviously known as the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, the network was founded in 1967 by two ministers in Greenwich Village and soon encompassed about 1,400 clergy members and laypeople who connected abortion seekers with vetted providers. In defiance of laws that criminalized the procedure, the organization says it helped around 500,000 patients between 1967 and 1973, the year Roe legalized abortion nationwide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Roe, there was less of an obvious need for a tightly organized referral network. The Clergy Consultation Service evolved into the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC), switching lanes from abortion referrals to advocacy. \u201cI think there might have been a certain amount of apathy. Like, \u2018This thing has been decided now. We\u2019ve won. We\u2019ve gotten Roe. Now abortion is legal everywhere,\u2019 \u201d said Rev. Katey Zeh, a Baptist minister and RCRC\u2019s CEO, about the years after Roe. Once abortion was legal across the country, pro-choice faith groups were drowned out and financially dwarfed by the booming anti-abortion movement. \u201cAs the political right\u2014or white Christian nationalism\u2014really started to gain momentum around abortion and made it so central to their platform, a lot of progressive clergy became very hesitant to talk about it more publicly because it became so divisive and controversial,\u201d Zeh said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, RCRC continued to offer online courses for pro-choice faith leaders and spiritual resources for abortion patients. But this summer, the organization saw a massive uptick in visits to its website, sign-ups for its mailing lists, and emails from people of faith searching for a way to help in the wake of Dobbs. \u201cPeople are paying attention in ways that they haven\u2019t in the past because of the moment that we\u2019re in,\u201d Zeh said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity to be organizing and educating.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nZeh pointed out that the newcomers to the movement don\u2019t need to start from scratch. In the decades since Roe, a secular ecosystem of abortion funds (which pay for abortion pills and procedures) and practical support groups (which coordinate and pay for associated travel, lodging, and child care costs) has grown to fill the gap between Roe\u2019s promise and its shortcomings for rural and low-income women, who often live hundreds of miles from a clinic or cannot afford a visit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBut faith communities can work with existing networks by offering access to their physical spaces, which are often underutilized on weekdays, or to transportation. They can collect donations. They can organize, in-house, to help fill in the gaps. In fact, faith leaders say, houses of worship are almost tailor-made for exactly the kind of crisis the Dobbs decision has produced.\n\nAnyone in a restrictive state who helps a person terminate a pregnancy in 2022 will be doing so under greater scrutiny and legal risk than they would have faced before Roe. Today\u2019s anti-abortion activists and lawmakers are cranking out new, punitive legal experiments\u2014interstate travel prohibitions, bans on sharing information, vigilante incentives\u2014that were not even a twinkle in a legislator\u2019s eye during the Clergy Consultation Service\u2019s heyday.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBut volunteer groups also have a new resource at their disposal that their predecessors could have only dreamed of: abortion medication. The two-drug regimen, which entered the U.S. marketplace in 2000, allows pregnant people to safely end their pregnancies in their own homes, on their own schedules, without having to find a trained practitioner to perform a procedure. Now, the FDA allows the drugs to be prescribed\u00a0via telemedicine\u00a0and shipped by mail. Some providers will even prescribe the medications in advance for people who are not yet pregnant but wish to be prepared for emergencies.\nOne Tuesday evening in July, a nonprofit called Faith Choice Ohio held a virtual gathering to teach the ins and outs of abortion medication to clergy, students, and at least one university administrator. Rev. Jessie Commeret, a 44-year-old Presbyterian pastor from a rural county in northwestern Ohio, attended the Zoom meeting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in her career, Commeret had counseled a few women who were considering abortion. Sometimes, she said, pregnant people want to speak to a clergy member before having the procedure\u2014even if they don\u2019t practice any specific faith\u2014because they\u2019ve internalized fear and shame about it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve also come across women in my congregation who are struggling with these choices, whether it\u2019s genetic abnormalities of fetuses, or just really struggling to understand\u2014What is life, and how does God produce life? What is God\u2019s place in all of that?\u201d Commeret said. Some of the people she\u2019s counseled \u201cgrew up really religiously conservative, and are saying, \u2018Am I going to go to hell for making this decision? What does the Bible say?\u2019 To be able to offer them a different answer, using my religious authority, is a gift.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe world is on fire right now, and we can\u2019t put out all the fires,\u201d Commeret said. \u201cBut we can find one and put out that fire. And so for me, this is my\u00a0fire.\u201d\n\nCommeret did this counseling in the mid-aughts through a Faith Choice Ohio program. Back then, any talk of a self-managed abortion at home was usually couched in language of danger and trauma. But now that abortion medication is more widely available\u2014and new studies have demonstrated its remarkable safety, even without a visit to a doctor\u2014reproductive health advocates are openly talking about how it works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Zoom training\u2019s facilitator, Elaina Ramsey, executive director of Faith Choice Ohio, walked the group through the functions of the two drugs used in a typical medication abortion (one stops the pregnancy from developing, the other causes contractions to empty the uterus); when they can be used (up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, though patients in some countries use them much later); and how safe they are to use on one\u2019s own (more so than Tylenol). After a patient allows the tablets of misoprostol to dissolve in the pocket between the cheek and gum, Ramsey said, if she later sees a doctor for follow-up care, investigators won\u2019t be able to detect the medication in her blood. Someone who visits a hospital after a medication abortion can simply say she is miscarrying, and doctors won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nRamsey also shared a word of warning. \u201cWe are not medical or legal professionals,\u201d she told the group. You\u2019re sharing information, \u201cnot giving advice. That helps protect you in this current political landscape.\u201d It\u2019s not just potential lawsuits from regretful, dissatisfied, or harmed patients that attendees might have to worry about. Laws that ban \u201caiding or abetting\u201d abortions, such as S.B. 8 in Texas, could conceivably be used to prosecute a pastor who helps a woman obtain and use abortion medication. (At the time of the Zoom training, a six-week abortion ban was in effect in Ohio; a Democratic judge has blocked that ban, allowing legal abortions through 22 weeks of pregnancy while litigation proceeds.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElaina Ramsey (second from left) and the staff of Faith Choice Ohio.\nCourtesy of Elaina Ramsey\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not \u201caiding and abetting\u201d to simply tell a patient how abortion medication works. For now, at least, it is legal in all 50 states to share information about how much bleeding a hypothetical person would expect after taking the pills, and about getting her IUD removed before ingesting them. But to be on the safe side, Ramsey advised using third-person language. For example: \u201cPeople often use this website to find abortion pills.\u201d Not: \u201cHere\u2019s where you can order your pills.\u201d\nRamsey has good reason to urge caution. Republican officials are presently exploring new ways to criminalize not just abortion providers, but anyone who helps a patient find care. In Texas, when a total abortion ban went into effect after the Dobbs decision, local abortion funds ceased operations, fearing criminal charges under newly enforceable statutes that specifically prohibit \u201cfurnishing the means to procure an abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conservative Ohio legislature could pass a similar law at any time. But, in June, anticipating the fall of Roe, Faith Choice Ohio launched the Jubilee Fund, which is explicitly designed to circumvent government restrictions on covering abortion-related expenses. Instead of paying clinics or patients directly, the Jubilee Fund gives block grants to participating congregations. Then, when a clinic or another abortion fund alerts Jubilee that a patient has asked for help, the fund connects the patient with a congregation that can provide a car ride to an out-of-state clinic, a child care stipend, a bus ticket, a gas card, or a hotel room for a multiday trip out of town, for instance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving two layers of faith-based organizations that handle the Jubilee Fund\u2019s money\u2014the fund and the congregations in its network\u2014is \u201creally important, because religious organizations are exempt from having to report who they serve and how they use their money,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThe state really can\u2019t monitor that. These safeguards, the firewall that we\u2019re supposed to have in this country between church and state, we\u2019re going to use that for our good, to be able to protect people.\u201d Clergy\u2013penitent privilege also prevents faith leaders from being called to testify in court against those who\u2019ve confided in them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of volunteers from Jubilee Fund congregations have been vetted and trained to transport patients to clinics around Ohio and to Michigan and Pennsylvania (where abortion remained legal during Ohio\u2019s six-week ban).\nThis investment in direct service was a strategic pivot for Faith Choice Ohio, which once devoted more of its resources to political advocacy. But all the protests and phone calls in the world could not sway the notoriously anti-abortion Ohio legislature. \u201cWe were beating our heads against a brick wall,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cAs important as it is to write letters to the editor and testify against bad bills, it\u2019s just not enough when the numbers are against us.\u201d The group has spent the past year restructuring to meet the immediate needs of patients instead.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ohio congregation Commeret leads is ideologically diverse. \u201cWe\u2019ve got folks who voted for Trump, and folks who can\u2019t imagine ever knowing someone who voted for Trump,\u201d she said. She knows her church will never take a vocal position in support of reproductive rights, much less buy bus tickets for women traveling to abortion clinics. But she\u2019s identified a dozen or so community members who feel moved to take action. As a small group, Commeret said, they are reading books about the intersection of Christianity and abortion rights \u201cto be able to articulate our message more clearly to others.\u201d They also plan to offer rides and child care to abortion patients and erect pro-choice billboards to counter anti-abortion signage in the area.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nCommeret\u2019s interest in this issue isn\u2019t just political; it\u2019s personal. Years ago, after she was ordained as a pastor, she had an abortion. \u201cA lot of my Christian brothers and sisters say, \u2018Well, any woman who terminates a pregnancy feels so much regret.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t feel any of that. I felt liberation,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she contemplates her role as a faith leader in a post-Dobbs America, Commeret is finding solace in the words of Nadia Bolz-Weber, a Lutheran pastor who has written about the capacity of overlapping crises\u2014climate change, a pandemic, the overturning of Roe\u2014to numb and burn out those who are disposed to care. \u201cShe wrote about how there are so many fires. The world is on fire right now, and we can\u2019t put out all the fires,\u201d Commeret said. \u201cBut we can find one and put out that fire. And so for me, this is my fire.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOften, when Ramsey tries to enlist faith communities to help pregnant patients get abortions, \u201cthey\u2019re first like, \u2018Wait, you want us to do what?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThis is all groundbreaking, cutting-edge to them. And I\u2019m like, \u2018It is, and it isn\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d\nThere is extensive historical precedent for this kind of work. Those involved in current efforts to get patients abortions say they\u2019ve taken inspiration from the sanctuary movement, a decades-old tradition of congregations shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation officials, who cannot\u2014or, due to optics, will not\u2014breach church doors to take an immigrant into custody.\n\u201cThink of congregations as volunteer organizations that are committed to certain values,\u201d Rev. Daniel Kanter, the senior minister and CEO of First Unitarian Church of Dallas, told me. \u201cWe share values around justice-making and service, and we\u2019re also networked and we trust each other.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne patient arrived at the church with an escape plan in case the supposedly pro-choice church was a front for a sex-trafficking ploy. That\u2019s how unlikely it seemed to\u00a0them.\n\nKanter serves on the steering committee of SACReD, a recently formed coalition for religious groups that want to push their abortion-rights ministries to the next level. (The titular acronym stands for Spiritual Alliance of Communities for Reproductive Dignity.) He and his colleagues are working to reimagine and reconstitute the Clergy Consultation Service of the 1960s and \u201970s to help today\u2019s patients access abortion.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the weeks after a six-week abortion ban took effect in Texas last year, Kanter initiated a program that transported pregnant patients to an abortion clinic in New Mexico. Every other week, about 20 patients would meet before sunrise at the Dallas church, where volunteers (mostly retired women) would greet them with homemade baked goods. Accompanied by a clergy member and a representative from the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, the patients would travel together to the airport, fly to Albuquerque, and take cars to an abortion clinic that had dedicated a scheduled block for the group. By 10 p.m., they\u2019d be back in Dallas and headed home.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRev. Dr. Daniel Kanter, a Unitarian minister in Dallas, organizes trips that take patients from Texas, where abortion is banned, to New Mexico, where it is legal.\nCourtesy of Daniel Kanter\n\n\nRev. Deneen Robinson\u2014a Unitarian minister who, like Kanter, has counseled patients for years as a chaplain at a Dallas abortion clinic\u2014joined two of these bimonthly trips. When she met the patients at the church on a Saturday in May, she introduced herself and asked each woman what kind of support she needed. \u201cSome were scared, some sad, and some were like, \u2018This is what I\u2019ve got to do.\u2019 Some didn\u2019t want to talk at all,\u201d Robinson said. One woman had never flown on a plane before, so Robinson stuck with her through the security checkpoints and boarding line.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nRobinson was alarmed to hear that one patient had arrived at the church with an escape plan, devised at her parents\u2019 urging, in case the supposedly pro-choice church was a front for a sex-trafficking ploy. That\u2019s how unlikely it seemed to them that a religious group would offer pregnant people a free trip across state lines for abortion care. \u201cIt\u2019s really a sad commentary for people of faith, especially religious leaders, that we have been successful in creating a narrative that we aren\u2019t willing to offer kindness and grace to people who are in a place of turmoil and struggle in their lives,\u201d Robinson said.\nOver the course of the long day, Robinson watched the women get to know one another. Some of them bonded in small groups, swapping stories about their relationships and sharing photos of their kids. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to every chaplain who\u2019s gone on the trip, and they all concur: The support between the patients is something to behold,\u201d Kanter said. They meet at 5 a.m. as strangers, and \u201cby the end of the day, you would have thought we\u2019d won the volleyball tournament.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circumstances that bring these women together are despicable: Lawmakers are using the state\u2019s power to force them to bear unwanted pregnancies, and without the church\u2019s support, they could not afford to travel out of state for care. An unintended but heartening consequence of the program is that, for some patients, the community the trips fostered alleviated feelings of desperate isolation that abortion bans are designed to instill.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThose trips ceased after the Dobbs decision, when Texas began enforcing a total abortion ban that includes penalties for people who assist with travel. Like the Texas abortion funds that stopped their operations in the wake of Dobbs, First Unitarian Church of Dallas paused to reconsider the magnitude of its legal risk.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group that organized and oversaw the trips\u2014more than a dozen clergy members from various religions and denominations\u2014has since resumed hosting trips of between five and 12 patients each week. Kanter said the program has \u201cchanged a lot\u201d to protect participants from legal liability, though he declined to provide details. He now consults with clergy members around the country who want to export the Dallas\u00ad\u2013Albuquerque model to their own regions. A possible partnership between congregations in Oklahoma, where abortion is banned, and Colorado, where it is legal, looks particularly promising.\n\nTwo years ago, anticipating the imminent end of Roe, leaders of the National Council of Jewish Women began asking their peers what role the organization should play in the response to the coming crisis. The 215,000-member grassroots network has advocated for reproductive rights for more than a century, and some of its 55 local chapters volunteer with nearby clinics and abortion funds. The organization has also opposed recent abortion restrictions on religious grounds, arguing in lawsuits and amicus briefs that they violate the freedom to practice Judaism. (Jewish texts and teachings explicitly reject the idea that a fetus is a person, placing a greater value on the health and well-being of a pregnant person.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBut over 150 hours of interviews, \u201cone of the things we heard loud and clear is that people on the ground need access to money more than anything else,\u201d said Sheila Katz, the council\u2019s CEO. Originally, NCJW had set out to create a volunteer force to serve abortion clinics around the country. \u201cBut what we heard over and over and over again is: This takes expertise. And the people with that expertise need money.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheila Katz (second from left, holding the banner) marches with Rev. William Barber, Tarana Burke, and other progressive leaders at an abortion-rights event in July.\nNational Council of Jewish Women\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nNCJW\u2019s biggest contribution to the immediate response to Dobbs is the newly established Jewish Fund for Abortion Access, which has raised $845,000 for the National Abortion Federation\u2019s relief efforts. According to Katz, the money is going toward NAF\u2019s current emergency needs, including a hotline that assigns case managers to callers who need abortions, funds for patient travel, and clinic fees for abortions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nNCJW set an initial fundraising timeline of six months to encourage donors to give immediately, but the fund may continue beyond that deadline. \u201cIt\u2019s not a small thing for a nonprofit organization to be fundraising for another organization,\u201d Katz said. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t one that was taken lightly.\u201d But ultimately, the NCJW board of directors voted unanimously to do just that, rather than embark on a service project that might \u201cmake us feel the best.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor good reason, abortion-rights advocates have been wary of bringing faith into the discourse of reproduction. (See, for example, the common protest slogan \u201cKeep your religion out of my uterus,\u201d and its catchier counterpart, \u201cKeep your rosaries off my ovaries.\u201d) To some, the Christian right has so completely monopolized the marketplace of abortion theology that any attempt to bring religious teachings to bear on a medical procedure is suspect.\nBut pro-choice faith leaders say there is little hope of reversing the punitive wave of abortion bans in the U.S. without addressing the conditions that produced them. Engaging with religious teachings on abortion will be \u201cone of the most important factors\u201d in beating back the prevailing\u2014and false\u2014belief that faithful people oppose abortion rights, said Rev. Rob Keithan, minister of social justice at All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe religious right has very strategically used and misused religion as a political tool\u201d while a vacuum opened on the left: Secular abortion-rights groups shied away from religion and progressive religious groups shied away from abortion, leaving the right\u2019s self-professed spiritual authority unchallenged.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Keithan and his peers see their mission as twofold: to make it known that practicing a religion need not mean opposing abortion, and to give people of faith a path to understanding reproductive freedom as a moral good, even a sacred blessing.\n\u201cThe right has been so effective\u2014in seminaries, in congregations, in sort of parachurch ministries,\u201d said Angela Tyler-Williams, co-director of SACReD, the hub for faith groups that support abortion access. \u201cWe need to be in seminaries. We need to be in college groups. We need to be in synagogues. We need to be in Sunday school classes. We need to be in the media.We need to be in TV. We need a full cultural immersion to challenge this idea, and to recognize what our lanes are.\u201d (One of Tyler-Williams\u2019 lanes is TikTok.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\nTyler-Williams is sympathetic to the notion that rosaries should keep clear of ovaries, in that the state should not impose a single religious interpretation of pregnancy on everyone, regardless of their individual beliefs. But in the U.S., any political discussion of abortion is already laden with religion, and Tyler-Williams feels called by God to participate.\nIn her sense of purpose, Tyler-Williams identifies with a tale from the Book of Esther, the basis for the Jewish festival of Purim. Esther, the secretly Jewish wife of a Persian king, is urged by a relative, Mordecai, to help stop a royal plot to massacre Jews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he says, \u2018Perhaps you were made for such a time as this.\u2019 That verse keeps coming up for us in our work at SACReD, for me personally and for our whole team,\u201d Tyler-Williams said. \u201cWe have been working on this for two years. We had no idea that it would come to this point, and that Roe would be overturned at this very moment. But we\u2019ve just been showing up, day in and day out, to prepare for this moment, and to be ready for the influx of people of faith around this country who are ready to take action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Religion\n            \n\n\n              Supreme Court\n            \n\n\n              Christ\n            \n\n\n              Judaism\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
