SIGN UP FOR DETROIT CATHOLIC'S DAILY OR WEEKLY DIGEST\n\nAnnalisa and Eric Agustin, parents of eight children ranging from 2 to 15, are undoubtedly pro-life. But this would be the family's first trip to the March for Life.\u00a0\nWhen the couple married on Sept. 27, 2003, at St. Rene Goupil Parish in Sterling Heights, they knew they wanted a family. Eight children later \u2014\u00a0Isaiah, 15; Ethan, 13; Owen, 11; Xavier, 10; Anthony, 7; Monica, 5; Maria, 4; and Gianna, 2 \u2014\u00a0the Agustins now live the pro-life mentality 24/7, 365 days a year.\n\u201cWhen we were pregnant with No. 4, I think at that point we had a deeper conversion (into being pro-life),\u201d Annalisa, who grew up in a family of three children, told Detroit Catholic.\u00a0\u201cGod really can change your heart. (Having more children) might not be what we (originally) wanted, but it\u2019s about what He wants.\u201d\nAnnalisa Agustin and her husband, Eric (background), took their eight children to the 2020 March for Life, the first time the Sterling Heights family attended the Washington, D.C., event. (Photos by Paul Duda | Detroit Catholic)Annalisa was born and raised Catholic and had a deep understanding of the pro-life message. Eric, an only child, was raised Methodist but remembers going to World Youth Day in 2002 and seeing the \u201camazing\u201d Catholic, pro-life witness, which encouraged him to explore the Church\u2019s teachings.\n\u201cBeing pro-life came with the knowledge and understanding of the truth with respect to the Church\u2019s teachings on life,\u201d Eric said. \u201cOnce you understand why the Church teaches what it teaches regarding contraception or abortion, you see there is a beauty that supersedes any other (teaching) you can find.\u201d\nSuch convictions laid the groundwork for how the Agustin family, members of SS. Cyril and Methodius Parish in Sterling Heights, approaches life. Eric is an engineer for General Motors, and Annalisa teaches math at Regina Caeli Academy, a homeschooling resource center where the children go to school.\nThe two parents admit life with eight children brings an abundance of challenges others might not see as blessings. But with God's presence in the household, they do see the blessings every day of the year.\nEric and Annalisa Agustin stand outside Capital One Arena, waiting for the Youth Rally for Life early Friday morning.\u00a0\nGianna, 2, is the youngest member of the Agustin family, pushed in a stroller during the March for Life.\u00a0Luci Guevara, 16, a friend of the Agustin family, holds 5-year-old Monica Agustin's hand. The Agustins met up with family friends during the march and employed some of the older kids to look after the younger ones.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite parts of having a big family is the more children you have, the more self-giving you become,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI\u2019m an only child; I\u2019m inherently selfish. But with each child that came, it was God shedding some of that, to the point where your life is that of service. And I just love that.\u201d\nBalancing eight different homework schedules, eight different meal preferences \u2014 the family has a chalkboard in the kitchen laying out the meal schedule for the week \u2014\u00a0and eight different sets of likes and dislikes is a crash course in being open to life. When every day is a celebration of the life of another, explaining to the children why defending life matters becomes easy, Annalisa said.\n\u201cWhen watching the March for Life, they have a ticker on the bottom with the number of abortions (since 1973), and it\u2019s so sad to see that number get so high, so quickly,\u201d Annalisa said. \u201cThere is always a baby in our home, so we can say (to our children), 'Look at that baby; imagine if that baby wasn\u2019t here.\u2019\u201d\nFor Isaiah, the eldest child and de facto leader of the Agustin children, having the chance to hold each of his seven brothers and sisters after they were born has shaped him.\u00a0\nIsaiah Agustin, 15, right, points out the sights and landmarks of Washington, D.C., to his younger brother, Owen, 11, during their march up Capitol Hill.\u201cIt\u2019s our duty to protect the unborn when they can\u2019t protect themselves,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cI love my siblings with all my heart, even if I don\u2019t show it all the time. But the gift they are, understanding the good and the bad \u2014 the screaming, the drama, but also the joy they bring \u2014 it completely overturns the bad. And I can\u2019t imagine life without them.\u201d\nOn the march with a platoon of 10\nThe Agustin family left in the wee hours the morning on Wednesday, Jan. 22, setting out from Sterling Heights to Washington accompanied by Annalisa\u2019s sister, Kimberly Ambrosio.\nOn the way, the family stopped at St. Anthony\u2019s Chapel in Pittsburgh to draw spiritual strength from the thousands of relics present, before spending Thursday in the nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0\nOn Friday, getting eight kids up at 4 a.m. and ready to brave the cold lines to get into Capital One Arena for the pre-march Youth Rally for Life was no easy task, but the Agustins took the sacrifice in stride.\nAnthony Agustin smiles bright and early in the morning before the Youth Rally for Life at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u201cI think the kids are doing pretty well,\u201d Annalisa told Detroit Catholic as the small platoon of Agustins marched down Constitution Avenue. \u201cWe fed them, and we have lots of snacks to keep everyone happy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s great when we\u2019re moving and whenever there is music,\u201d Annalisa added, motioning to a man on the street corner playing an electric guitar. \u201cIsaiah is calling this the \u2018pro-life shuffle\u2019 \u2014 we are just walking and stopping, walking and stopping \u2014 but now that we are moving more, everyone is in a better mood.\u201d\nLike most first-time marchers, the sheer number of people attending the March for Life blew the Agustins away. Eric, a veteran of World Youth Day, said even that experience was nothing compared to half a million people marching down a single street.\n\u201cI heard it was an experience, but I didn\u2019t understand how it was such a predominately Catholic experience,\u201d Eric said, noting the sea of priests, religious and students from Catholic schools. \u201cWe went to the Rally for Life beforehand, and that was just a powerful thing to see, all these young people committed to the pro-life cause.\u201d\nFamily friend Elijah Guevara, 16, left, laughs with Ethan Agustin, 13, and Isaiah Agustin, 15, during the March for Life.Making their way to the National Mall for the Rally for Life, standing shoulder to shoulder with thousands of other pro-lifers, the family stopped as shouts filled the air when President Donald Trump \u2014 the first sitting president to do so \u2014 addressed the crowd.\n\u201cSeeing Donald Trump on stage will be something etched in my memory,\u201d 13-year-old Ethan said. \u201cWe were really far away, but he had this speech about supporting the pro-lifers, which I thought was kind of cool, I never saw a president before. The passion everyone has for the unborn, the stories they told, it shows that they really believe this is the right thing to do and that we are not alone.\u201d\nEric cautioned his children there would be counter-protesters at the march \u2014 and there were a few \u2014 but he emphasized that protesting is \u201cthe most American thing anyone can do,\u201d and told them to keep their heads straight and remember why they were there.\nIsaiah added there is \u201cnothing you can do but pray\u201d for those counter-protesting, and to draw strength from the overwhelming numbers at the March for Life.\nEthan Agustin, 13, holds a sign that reads \u201cPray to end abortion\u201d during the March for Life.\u201cIt\u2019s cool to be part of a movement that is bigger than me,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cBeing here as a family, it says a lot about my parents that they promote being pro-life so much. They love us, I know that, but the fact they would bring us here says so much about what they want to teach us and what they want us to know is important.\u201d\nEric described marching up Capitol Hill as a \u201cmountaintop feeling\u201d that opened his eyes to just how big the pro-life movement is.\n\u201cThis is one of those big, highlight events of my life,\u201d Eric said. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time going, my kids\u2019 first time going, and to see so many like-minded people is extremely encouraging; it definitely bolsters my faith. When I go back to the world after this, when our family goes back to the world, I'll know that this is something a lot of people believe in, and I\u2019m one of them.\u201d\nA long day, but a continuing journey\nArriving atop Capitol Hill, standing before the Supreme Court, the Agustins marked the end of their physical march knowing their celebration of life will continue long after the memories have faded and the sore feet have healed.\nTired, cold, worn down and looking to get off their feet, the Agustins marched back to their hotel together, physically exhausted, but spiritually energized at what they had witnessed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing OK at the end of a long day, but we did it, bringing eight kids to the March for Life, and it was a blast,\u201d Eric said. \u201cThe highlight, I think, was the youth rally beforehand, the Mass before the march, and just seeing my kids enthusiastic, taking it all in.\u201d\n\nXavier Agustin, 10, holds a sign during the Youth Rally for Life at Capital One Arena.Maria Agustin, 4, laughs in her stroller as her family marches down Constitution Avenue.\u00a0\n\nAlong the march, the Agustins met others from across the country with similar stories, some of whom came from as far as California to stand up for a common cause.\n\u201cDuring the Mass this morning, the priest said he came from a family of eight children \u2014 five brothers and three sisters \u2014 which I thought was cool because that\u2019s our family,\u201d Annalisa said. \u201cWe met so many people who have this amazing pro-life attitude, talking about the difficulties they face \u2014 people who have gone through trauma and death, but have found joy in life. Then I look at the joy my children bring and realize: this is why I\u2019m marching.\u201d\nAfter a full day on his feet, praying and watching out for his brothers and sisters, Isaiah said he was mostly looking forward to diving into the hotel pool. Buzzing from the energy and excitement of the day, he said the march has only strengthened his pro-life convictions.\n\u201cI definitely feel this will change my perspective on the way pro-lifers just do life,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cI remember coming across people who are pro-choice, who didn\u2019t seem happy we were there. But even though we can\u2019t see them change their mind, we can still pray for them, just like St. Monica with St. Augustine. Great things can happen; you just have to pray and let God intervene.\u201d\n\u201cOur God is a God of hope,\u201d Eric Agustin says, as his family makes the climb up Capitol Hill during the March for Life. \u201cHe doesn't demand results from us; He demands trust.\u201dWith eight kids accounted for, and two tired parents who said they wouldn\u2019t trade the experience for the world, the Agustins said their first March for Life validates the values they try to live every day.\n\u201cOur God is a God of hope,\u201d Eric said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t demand results from us; He demands trust. That's what we are doing: we are living in hope. Today, my kids got to see suffering, an effect of sin, and they got to see hope that God will heal our country from this sin.\n\u201cFor Annalisa and I, we have been through so much in our marriage \u2014 our own suffering, our own trials and tribulations. But that\u2019s how you serve each other in marriage, in fatherhood, in motherhood. It\u2019s been a joy to spend time with other folks who share that light, to walk with others who are willing to march for life.\u201d\nDetroit Catholic's Dan Meloy reports from Washington, D.C.
