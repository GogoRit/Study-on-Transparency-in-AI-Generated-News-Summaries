EdelinGuest columnistAs I watched the Senate confirmation hearings for\u00a0Amy Coney Barrett, I reflected on the remembrances of Justice Ruth Badger Ginsberg only a few short weeks ago.And I found myself thinking about my late husband and the sacrifice he made to live out the promise of Roe v. Wade, as well as Justice Ginsberg\u2019s efforts to keep that promise.\u00a0On January 22, 1973, in a landmark decision, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled in the case Roe v. Wade that the U.S. Constitution protects a pregnant woman\u2019s liberty to choose an abortion without excessive government restriction. One year later, in Boston, my husband was indicted on a charge of manslaughter by a secret grand jury.\u00a0The alleged victim was a fetus which was aborted during the performance of a second-trimester abortion, despite the ruling of Roe that made the procedure legal.After a sensational six-week trial, on Feb. 15, 1975, Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was found guilty of the manslaughter charge by an all-white, predominantly male\u00a0and overwhelmingly Catholic jury. On\u00a0appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts overturned the verdict, ruling that he had \u201ccommitted no wanton or reckless acts carrying out the medical procedures\u2026\u201dThe death of Ken\u2019s mother from breast cancer when he was just 12 years old had prompted him to choose a life of service in health care.\u00a0 He always said that being black and poor was a factor that kept her from receiving the medical attention she needed to save her life.\u00a0 He was determined to provide quality health care to women in poor communities to honor her death.\u00a0So\u00a0when a young, scared 17-year-old sought help at Boston City Hospital to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, Ken was the resident on duty and responded to the call in the clinic.\u00a0 In a meeting with the young woman and her mother, she told him she wanted to go on to college the following year, Ken would say, and he wanted to help her have that choice.\u00a0 Abortion had been legal in the country for over nine months at that time, but only two doctors at City Hospital would perform them.The situation my husband faced in October 1973\u00a0was one he considered a part of his job as a physician.\u00a0 Ken, a 34-year-old resident, was only a few months away from finishing his residency and starting a full career as an obstetrician-gynecologist.\u00a0 His decision to perform the abortion was in line with his philosophy that abortion was just one more aspect of providing quality health care to women, and it was legal.\u00a0 But this decision would change his life forever.When he was indicted, he was called a \u201cbaby killer\u201d and targeted by the anti-choice movement.\u00a0 He was suspended from his job at the hospital for months after the indictment, and at trial he felt that the prosecution was vicious and personal.\u00a0 He would say later that\u00a0\"in Boston in 1973, it was the perfect storm:\u00a0the religious climate, the racial climate. \u2026 It was the right place and the right time for those who wanted to make a statement.\u00a0 It was the wrong place and the wrong time for me.\u201dAfter the appeal and his exoneration, Ken became a prominent voice in the abortion debate and in 1989 was chosen to be the chairman of the board of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.Ken wrote in his 2007 memoir, \u201cBroken Justice,\u201d that \u201cthe rights of women to make choices about their pregnancies and doctors to be able to offer their patients he most appropriate care continues to be under attack.\u00a0Recent Supreme Court rulings have further restricted a women\u2019s right to choose.\u00a0There is no question efforts will continue to be made to overturn Roe.\u201d\u00a0He knew then 13 years ago the importance of what this country is facing right now \u2013 today.As the newest justice, Barrett will directly impact the fate of our freedoms.\u00a0The issues of gender equality, racial disparities in the practice of medicine, and basic social justice issues in this country will be effected by this choice.\u00a0If the court overturns Roe v. Wade, women will be forced to seek illegal abortions and\u00a0to submit to dangerous procedures, often at great expense and may result in the death of many of them.\u00a0This burden would fall disproportionately, as it did in the years before Roe, on the poor women of our country.\u00a0 We must never return to those days of horror.Barbara E. Edelin moved to Sarasota from Boston in 2006 with her late husband,\u00a0Kenneth C. Edelin, who died in 2013.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Public notice certification Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Public Notices Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Submit Community NewsSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.heraldtribune.com.
