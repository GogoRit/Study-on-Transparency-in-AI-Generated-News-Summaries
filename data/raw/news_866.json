So on Thursday, the Texas Supreme Court, which is entirely controlled by Republican justices, heard arguments on the issue of whether state licensing officials have a role in enforcing the law.\nREAD MORE: Abortions in Texas drop by 60 percent in 1st month under new restrictions\nHearron said that if the state Supreme Court rules that licensing officials can\u2019t enforce the law in any way, that would \u201ceffectively end\u201d their challenge to the law.\nHe said said that if the court said such officials could enforce the law, they would seek an injunction so the officials couldn\u2019t revoke the licenses of abortion providers who performed abortions after six weeks.\n\u201cThe best outcome we can get in this case would be a ruling blocking the state licensing officials from discipling doctors and nurses, pharmacists and facilities or revoking those facility licenses for violating\u201d the law, he said.\nThe attorney representing Texas, Judd E. Stone II, told the judges a that the law is clear that no enforcement \u201cmay be taken or threatened by the state.\u201d\n\u201cIf a state official revoked a doctor\u2019s license as a consequence of violating (the law), any ordinary individual would describe that as enforcement,\u201d Stone said.\nIn the meantime, the U.S. Supreme Court in a ruling expected this summer in a Mississippi case has signaled a willingness to weaken or reverse the landmark Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing a right to an abortion.\nShortly after the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8 took effect, a lawsuit filed in federal court argued it was enacted \u201cin open defiance of the Constitution.\u201d U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ordered Texas to suspend the law but barely two days later, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the law, which which doesn\u2019t make exceptions for rape or incest.\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in, the case went back to the 5th Circuit, which ruled against sending the case back Pitman \u2014 the only judge who has ever blocked the restrictions \u2014 and instead sent it to the Texas Supreme Court.\nFigures recently released by Texas showed that abortions fell by 60 percent in the first month under the law, from over 5,400 abortions in August to nearly 2,200 abortions in September.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A pro-choice demonstrator holds a sign outside the United States Supreme Court as the court hears arguments over a challenge to a Texas law that bans abortion after six weeks in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2021.
