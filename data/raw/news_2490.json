You won't say that,\" Dickerson said. \"Why?\"\n\"All my life, I've been inspired by the example of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. When I was in Congress, I traveled to his home church in Montgomery with Congressman John Lewis. I walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday,\" Pence replied. \"I cherish the progress that we have made toward a more perfect union for African-Americans throughout our history, and I've aspired throughout my career to be a part of that ongoing work. It's really a heart issue for me.\"\nHe then cited his anti-abortion views in defense of not saying the words.\n\"And as a pro-life American, I also believe that all life matters:\u00a0born and unborn,\" Pence said.\nThe vice president then added that he opposes the message of the protests against police brutality.\n\"What I see in the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement is a political agenda of the radical left that would defund the police,\" he said. \"That would tear down monuments. That would press a radical left agenda\u00a0and support calls for the kind of violence that has beset the very communities that they say that they're advocating for.\"\n\"So you won't say,\u00a0'Black lives matter?'\" Dickerson repeated.\n\"John, I really believe that all lives matter,\" Pence answered.\u00a0\n\nPence's comments, in fact, distorted King's legacy.\n\"While this vision of King as a peaceable and unifying figure may be comforting, it is incomplete at best and in many ways misleading,\" Mark and Paul Engler, the authors of \"This Is an Uprising: How Nonviolent Revolt is Shaping the Twenty-First,\" wrote in\u00a0Salon. \"King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) often drew criticism not only from defenders of segregation but also would-be allies who believed the protests the organization helped lead were unduly abrasive and ultimately counter-productive. In this way, King bears much in common with the #BlackLivesMatter activists who are currently being attacked for perceived impatience and incivility in promoting their cause.\"\nIt was\u00a0not the first time Pence has publicly refused to say\u00a0\"Black lives matter.\"\nThe vice president similarly insisted that \"all lives matter\" in an interview with a Pennsylvania news outlet on Juneteenth, the holiday which\u00a0commemorates the end of slavery.\n\"People are saying, 'Of course, all lives matter.' But to say the words is an acknowledgment that Black lives also matter at a time in this country when it appears that there's a segment of our society that doesn't agree,\" anchor Brian Taff pressed Pence. \"So why will you not say those words?\"\nPence said he disagreed that \"there's a segment of American society that disagrees, in the preciousness and importance of every human life.\"\n\"And yet, one final time, you won't say the words, and we understand your explanation,\" Taff replied.\n\nAfter Pence's interview on Sunday, Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, told Dickerson that it would not have mattered what Pence said, pointing to a video shared by President Donald Trump in which one of his supporters shouted\u00a0\"white power.\"\n\"Even if the vice president had said Black lives matter, it would be hollow,\" she said. \"And I wouldn't believe it. Because he is the vice president of the United States, just like we have a president, just like we have senators and they should be judged by their actions and what they do.\"\nIfill took issue with Pence claiming to be guided his entire life by King.\n\"Then he would know what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said about protests in 1965 and '66 that protested police violence in African-American communities when he said riots are the language of the unheard,\" she said. \"So to hear him say that and then at the same time hear his comments about protests demonstrate that the vice president is far from understanding the significance of this moment and really what his obligation is when people across the country in 50 states, not just Black people, but people of all races are coming together and standing together and saying enough is enough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Igor Derysh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgor Derysh is Salon's managing editor.
