(Bruce Schreiner/AP)Listen4 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveThree Jewish women in Kentucky have filed a lawsuit arguing that a set of state laws that ban most abortions violate their religious rights.The lawsuit, filed in Jefferson Circuit Court in Louisville, is the third such suit brought by Jewish organizations or individuals since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion in its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. In all three suits \u2014 the first in Florida, the second in Indiana \u2014 the Jewish plaintiffs claim their state is infringing on their religious freedom by imposing a Christian understanding of when life begins.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightUnder current Kentucky laws, life begins at the moment of fertilization. Another law bans abortion after six weeks when cardiac activity is first detected.Clerics sue over Florida abortion law, saying it violates religious freedomAbortion will be on the ballot next month when Kentuckians decide the fate of a proposed constitutional amendment that would eliminate the right to abortion in the state.Advertisement\u201cThere are a whole patchwork of laws, passed over the last 20 years,\u201d said Ben Potash, one of the lawyers who filed the complaint. \u201cThey\u2019re internally inconsistent and, put together, very vague.\u201dMost Jews believe abortion is allowed and, in some cases, even required.\u201cJudaism has never defined life beginning at conception,\u201d the Kentucky suit says, adding that \u201cmillennia of commentary from Jewish scholars has reaffirmed Judaism\u2019s commitment to reproductive rights.\u201dThe suit, filed Thursday, repurposes a legal tactic successfully used by conservative Christian groups in recent years.The Satanic Temple takes aim at Idaho, Indiana abortion bansThe women are not the first to challenge Kentucky\u2019s abortion bans. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood sued the state shortly after the Dobbs ruling was handed down.What\u2019s distinct about the latest suit is that all three of the Jewish women require in vitro fertilization to become pregnant but are afraid of beginning the procedure without greater clarity about what the law will permit them to do with excess frozen embryos. The suit claims the women must spend exorbitant fees to keep their embryos frozen indefinitely, and they are unsure whether they will face felony charges if they dispose of them.AdvertisementFurther, because pregnancies resulting from infertility treatments have a higher rate of stillbirth, the women foresee the possibility of not wanting to carry their IVF pregnancies to term if the fetus is not viable.Share this articleShareThe law \u201cdoes not impose clear standards, rules, or regulations regarding the potential experiences of potential birth givers with regards to their access to reproductive technology,\u201d their suit says.In this sense, the Kentucky suit is about women who want to give birth, not women who want to abort, said Sheila Katz, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, which is supporting and advising plaintiffs in all three states where the abortion restrictions are being challenged in court.\u201cIt\u2019s a scary time to be pregnant,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe state is telling them their life is not as valuable as the fetus. These women are saying, \u2018A, that\u2019s against our religious tradition, and B, you owe us with being less vague about what this will look like so we can start our families.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisementIn June, a Jewish congregation in Florida filed suit arguing the state\u2019s 15-week abortion ban \u2014 signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) \u2014 prohibits Jewish women practicing their faith free of government intrusion. In September, a group called Hoosier Jews for Choice sued, claiming, among other things, that the Indiana law banning abortion violated the state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.Month before midterms, abortion in focus as GOP backs Herschel WalkerThe women in Kentucky claim the abortion ban similarly violates their state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That law states that government \u201cshall not substantially burden a person\u2019s freedom of religion\u201d unless it proves a compelling interest and uses \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d to do so.\u201cIf you\u2019re Jewish, you\u2019re having a very narrowly defined idea of when life begins imposed on you that is incongruent with our religious beliefs of when life begins,\u201d said Lisa Sobel, 38, one of the women in the lawsuit.She said she met the other plaintiffs, Jessica Kalb and Sarah Barton, through Louisville\u2019s Jewish community. They learned that all three require IVF treatments to have children.\u201cWhen Dobbs came down,\u201d Sobel said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u2014 Religion News ServiceShare CommentsMore in religionHAND CURATEDPope Francis allows blessings of same-sex couples, shifting Vatican guidanceDecember 18, 2023Pope Francis allows blessings of same-sex couples, shifting Vatican guidanceDecember 18, 2023He was Mormon royalty.
