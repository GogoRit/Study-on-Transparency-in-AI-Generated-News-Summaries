Wade overturn means for abortion rights in Pa., N.J., and Del.\nHere is the outlook for abortion access in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware after the SCOTUS ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nByLauren IngenoUpdated Jul. 8, 2022 2:51 pm\n\n\n\nA crowd of people gather outside the Supreme Court, early Tuesday, May 3, 2022 in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday\u2019s long-anticipated U.S. Supreme Court ruling has overturned Roe v. Wade, though that doesn\u2019t mean that there will be a nationwide ban on abortions. Instead, abortion policy will be left up to state and local lawmakers.\nTwenty-six states are now certain or likely to ban the procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\nResidents in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey won\u2019t be immediately affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u2014 however, that could change by November\u2019s midterm elections, especially in the Keystone State.\nBeyond abortion care, the Roe reversal could have other, serious implications for Americans across all states, including decreased access to birth control, increased violence at clinics, and violations to digital privacy.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHYY thanks our sponsors \u2014 become a WHYY sponsor\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a round-up of what\u2019s at stake in our region.\nPennsylvania\nIn Pennsylvania, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks after a person\u2019s last menstrual period. A patient seeking an abortion must receive state-mandated counseling that includes information designed to discourage them from having an abortion, and then wait 24 hours before the procedure is provided.\nHealth plans offered in the state\u2019s health exchange under the Affordable Care Act can only cover abortion if the person\u2019s life is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest.\nIn 2020, there were 32,123 abortions performed in Pennsylvania, according to data from the state\u2019s health department. Nearly half were to white individuals, followed closely by Black patients at 44%. About 11% of abortions performed in Pennsylvania were for Hispanic patients.\nFor now, abortion remains legal for Pennsylvanians. Governor Tom Wolf has been a strong advocate for abortion rights in the state, vetoing several bills passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly that would further restrict abortion access. At a May rally in Philadelphia, Wolf promised to continue opposing anti-abortion legislation during his remaining months in office.\nBut come November, Pennsylvania voters will be choosing a new governor, and only one candidate \u2014 Attorney General and Democratic nominee Josh Shapiro \u2014 has vowed to maintain abortion protections. Sen. Doug Mastriano, the Republican nominee, introduced a so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill to Pennsylvania in 2019, which would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. (Medical and reproductive health experts say an embryo does not have a developed heart at six weeks\u2019 gestation.)\n        \n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourts & Law \n\n            Pennsylvania could become destination for abortions if Roe is overturned                       \n\nAt least 23 states have laws on the books that would likely ban abortions if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade, including Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n2 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMastriano, a devout Christian who has made his religion central to his political career, has abortion views that go beyond much of the GOP. He has said he supports a total ban on the procedure without exceptions \u2014 including for rape, incest, or a medical emergency in which the parent\u2019s life is at risk \u2014 and that he would pursue abortion policies that reflect those beliefs as governor.\nOne other caveat: No matter who lands in the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s seat, a constitutional amendment is making its way through the state legislature that advocates say could have dire consequences for abortion access in the state. The GOP-proposed amendment would explicitly say the Pennsylvania constitution does not guarantee any rights related to abortion or abortion funds.\u00a0 That means that Democrats would have no ability to challenge anti-abortion laws in state courts. The governor does not have the power to veto constitutional amendments. If the legislature passes the proposal, it will go before voters in a statewide referendum as early as May 2023.\nFollowing the leak of the draft of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in May, Democrats in the U.S. Senate moved quickly to try and pass legislation that would enshrine the 50-year-old ruling into federal law, but they were blocked by the GOP filibuster of the bill. Without Roe, protecting abortion rights nationally would require adding Democrats to the Senate, which means November\u2019s race in Pennsylvania will be \u201call about this issue,\u201d attorney Kathryn Kolbert said on WHYY\u2019s \u201cRadio Times.\u201d Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman has said protecting reproductive freedom is \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d while Republican Mehmet Oz \u201clooks forward to supporting pro-life legislation.\u201d\nIf Pennsylvania\u2019s current abortion laws remain intact, experts say there may be another outcome in a post-Roe world: Abortion providers in the state will likely see a surge in demand from out-of-state patients seeking the procedure. A report from the Guttmacher Institute estimates that the number of people within driving distance of Pennsylvania who could seek abortions there would increase by more than 1,000% if Roe is overturned \u2014 from 170,000 annually now, to 2.1 million. Though New Jersey\u2019s and Delaware\u2019s abortion protections are not at risk, neighboring Ohio is poised to pass an abortion ban after today, and West Virginia will also likely enact a ban.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHYY thanks our sponsors \u2014 become a WHYY sponsor\n\n\n\nElicia Gonzales, executive director of ALF-PA, told WHYY News that she worries Pennsylvania health care providers and the state\u2019s abortion funds will not be able to meet the demand of patients coming into the state seeking abortion care.\nPlanned Parenthood Keystone CEO and President Melissa Reed said the country is \u201cat a crisis moment for abortion access,\u201d but the organization has spent many months preparing for the moment, including expanding abortion availability in the state via telemedicine and direct-to-patient medical abortion, which sends abortion medication through the mail.\nNew Jersey\nThe right to an abortion \u2014 at all stages of pregnancy \u2014 is protected in New Jersey, thanks to the state\u2019s Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which Governor Phil Murphy signed into law in anticipation of a Roe v. Wade reversal in January.\nThe bill codifies a person\u2019s right to abortion in New Jersey, extending that protection beyond the federal constitution. Unlike the previous version of the measure, the bill that passed this year does not require insurance providers to cover abortions.\n        \n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics & Policy \n\n            Shapiro, only Dem running for Pa. governor, vows to veto abortion restrictions                       \n\nIf elected, Shapiro could be key to maintaining abortion protections in Pennsylvania. Every Republican candidate supports banning or limiting abortions. \n\n2 years ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Roe reversal, Murphy signed two additional bills into law that aim to protect those\u00a0from outside the state who are seeking abortion services within New Jersey\u2019s borders. The new legislation allows out-of-state patients to access confidential abortion services without fear of being prosecuted. It also barrs the extradition of people involved in reproductive health care services should they face charges in another state.\nIn 2019, the state reported that 22,178 abortions were performed at hosptials and licensed ambulatory care facilities. Reporting of abortions is not mandatory in New Jersey for private physicians and women\u2019s centers.\nSimilar to Pennsylvania, New Jersey is likely now to become a \u201csafe haven\u201d for those seeking abortions from other states.\nDelaware\nAbortion in Delaware is legal up to fetal viability, or after viability if the patient\u2019s health is endangered, or if there is a lethal fetal anomaly.\nAbortion was prohibited until 2017, when the state\u2019s General Assembly repealed its pre-Roe ban and passed a law specifically protecting reproductive freedom.\nThat law ensures that abortion will remain legal in the state, even after the overturn of Roe v. Wade.\nState representatives have tried since to pass restrictions on the procedure, but without success.\nDelaware\u2019s General Assembly has also passed legislation that expands the state\u2019s pool of abortion providers and protects the health records of people who trek to Delaware from places with restrictive abortion laws.\nIn 2019, there were 2,042 abortions performed in Delaware, 1,765 to residents, and 277 to non-residents, according to data from the state\u2019s Department of Health and Social Services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the WHYY app!\n\nStream WHYY-FM, read the top stories from WHYY News, and listen to the latest podcast from WHYY Digital Studios \u2014 anytime, anywhere.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nShare thisFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nWHYY is your source for fact-based, in-depth journalism and information.
