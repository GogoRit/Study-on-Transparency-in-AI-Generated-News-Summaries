Carlson\u00a0said it was \u201cbeautiful\u201d when the pope explained why life was the number one, most important issue, \u201cbecause if you\u2019re not alive, you can\u2019t do anything else.\u201dArchbishop Carlson said they also talked about the importance of supporting pregnant women and making sure they have the resources they need to support that life.Pope Francis \u201ccertainly talked about abortion as a preeminent issue,\u201d Archbishop Carlson said, \u201cat the same time he said there\u2019s another significant issue and that would be \u2018transgender\u2019 \u2014 where we are trying to make all human beings the same, it makes no difference, you can be whoever you want to be.\u201dThe pope, he said, brought the issue up as an example of \u201canother significant issue in our day.\u201dArchbishop Robert J. Carlson of Saint Louis, center, and other U.S. bishops prayed at the tomb of St. Peter after concelebrating Mass in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican Jan. 16, 2020.

He and other bishops spoke to Catholic News Service Jan. 16 after meeting with the pope for more than two hours.Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, chairman of the bishops\u2019 committee, said that the pope agreed with the U.S. bishops \u201cidentifying the protection of the unborn as a preeminent priority.\u201d\u201cHis response to that was, \u2018Of course, it is. It\u2019s the most fundamental right,\u2019\u201d Archbishop Naumann recalled the pope saying. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is not first a religious issue; it\u2019s a human rights issue,\u2019 which is so true.\u201dArchbishop Naumann said he told the pope that since the Roe v. Wade court decision legalized abortion, an estimated 61 million abortions have taken place in the United States.\u201cI think the pope was truly kind of stunned by that number,\u201d Archbishop Naumann said. \u201cSadly, our abortion policies are one of the most liberal in the world. The fact is that it really is literally for all nine months of pregnancy. Most other nations don\u2019t permit (abortions) at least at a certain point in the pregnancy.\u201dArchbishop Naumann said that while Pope Francis has \u201celevated issues like the care of refugees and migrants,\u201d he also understands that the situation in the United States is different compared to other countries.\u201cI think sometimes as he elevates those things, people mistakenly think, \u2018Well, that means that the abortion issue will become less important,\u2019\u201d he said.Pope Francis met with U.S. bishops from Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska during their \"ad limina\" visits to the Vatican Jan. 16, 2020.

Shawn McKnight of Jefferson City, Missouri, said that on the issue of abortion, Pope Francis \u201csimply reiterated what he\u2019s already said in many different ways,\u201d which is that \u201cwithout life, what other rights are there? So, you have to begin with that. It\u2019s not the only issue \u2014 I don\u2019t think anybody has ever said that. But when you\u2019re looking at the core beliefs and the more essential rights, the right to life of the unborn is very important.\u201dThe pope, he said, \u201cput it in a very beautiful way: Do we always want to simply eliminate those who are inconvenient? And, unfortunately, that\u2019s part of our culture in the United States \u2014 the practice, the habit, if you will, of just eliminating the uncomfortable, the unwanted, as the solution. And we\u2019re called to be better than that. We as a country are better than that.\u201dWhen the U.S. bishops say, \u201cthe right to life is the \u2018preeminent issue\u2019\u201d in Catholics\u2019 political concerns, \u201cthat word is carefully chosen,\u201d Bishop McKnight said. \u201cBecause we want to avoid the perspective or the understanding that it\u2019s the only issue \u2014 because it is not.\u201dCatholic voters, he said, need to be aware of a more general tendency or temptation \u201cto get rid of unwanted people,\u201d whether they are the unborn or the aged, immigrants or the poor. \u201cThere is a certain consistency that is required of us as Catholics.\u201dBishop McKnight said that during the meeting, he thanked Pope Francis for expanding the section of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that investigates clerical sexual abuse.It was clear during the discussion how much the clerical sexual abuse crisis \u201cpains the Holy Father,\u201d he said. \u201cHe reiterated that this must be dealt with, it\u2019s a crime, it can\u2019t just be swept under the rug or dealt with only in the confessional \u2014 no, it\u2019s a crime.\u201dPope Francis posed for a photo with Archbishop Robert J.

McCarrick, the former cardinal and archbishop of Washington, was brought up by one of the bishops.\u201cI must respect the confidential nature of our conversation today,\u201d Bishop McKnight said. \u201cI can just say I am very confident the pope is doing everything he can in order to rectify the problem and to help the entire Church learn from the mistake of McCarrick\u2019s promotion in the Church. The Holy Father sees that, he recognizes that McCarrick\u2019s promotion as archbishop of Washington should never have happened.\u201dContributing to this story were Junno Arocho Esteves, Carol Glatz and Cindy Wooden.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                    To Read The Full Story\r\n                \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\r\n                    Subscribe\r\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support inline frames.
