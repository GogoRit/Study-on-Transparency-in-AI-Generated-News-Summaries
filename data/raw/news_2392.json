Power The history of Catholic teaching on abortion isn\u2019t as clear cut as you think Its position has hardly been \u201cunchangeable\u201d throughout the past two millennia.             Molly Monk Jan\u201416\u20142020 09:58AM EST           Even though 56 percent of U.S. Catholics believe that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, it\u2019s a commonly held belief that being \u201cpro-choice\u201d is incompatible with being Catholic. That\u2019s not surprising, given the Catholic Church\u2019s stance on abortion seems pretty clear cut: abortion is a murder. The Catechism of the Catholic Church even says, \u201cSince the first century, the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.\u201dThat\u2019s not exactly true, though.While it\u2019s fair to say that the Catholic Church has always leaned anti-abortion, history does not support that its position has been \u201cunchangeable\u201d throughout the past two millennia. Rather, the lives and writings of Catholic saints and papal decisions show that the Church has adapted its position on abortion many times, and that there\u2019s still room for discussion on the matter.The abortion debate in the Catholic Church has largely coalesced around two main issues: the Church\u2019s preference for chastity and the question of when human life begins.Sex is, uh, a complicated matter in Catholicism. While the \u201cconjugal embrace\u201d is celebrated within the confines of marriage (and then only if the marriage is \u201copen\u201d to procreation), power within the Church is reserved for men who swear to practice celibacy. For centuries, the main issue with abortion in the Catholic Church was that in order to have an abortion, you first needed to have had sex. Abortion was sinful because it nullified the only acceptable reason for having sex: procreation. In their book, A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion, philosophers Daniel Dombrowski and Robert Deltete call this the \u201cperversity view,\u201d and explain that because the only permissable reason to have sex was procreation, \u201cabortion perverts sex and is immoral in the same way that contraception is immoral.\u201dBut sometimes when sex that resulted in pregnancy occured outside of marriage, undoing it was considered a miracle.Ireland has long been known as one of the most Catholic nations in the world. In the early 1980s, more than 90 percent of the country attended Catholic Mass weekly, and in 1983 Ireland ratified a constitutional amendment that banned abortion in almost all cases (this amendment was only repealed in 2018). At the time, many decried the amendment as \u201cmedieval\u201d. However, in medieval Ireland, there are multiple instances of abortion being listed as a miracle performed by Catholic saints.In records of their lives from the first millennia, saints Brigid of Kildare, Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir, Cainnech of Aghaboe, and \u00c1ed mac Bricc all have abortions recounted among their miracles.\u201cWhat strikes me most is that these aren\u2019t insignificant saints performing these taboo actions,\u201d said Dr. Maeve Callan, an associate professor of Religion at Simpson College and specialist on Medieval Irish history. \u201cBrigid is arguably the most beloved Irish saint.\u201dIn the hagiography of St. Brigid\u2019s life, the strength of her faith that enables her to perform a miraculous abortion that restores virtue to a horny nun.\u201cA certain woman who had taken the vow of chastity fell, through youthful desire of pleasure and her womb swelled with child. Brigid, exercising the most potent strength of her ineffable faith, blessed her, causing the child to disappear, without coming to birth, and without pain.\u201d While the Brigid abortion largely focuses on the perversity view (breaking the vow of chastisty), other miraculous abortions are more focused on the question of when human life begins. Such is the case of Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir. Before his story begins, St. Ciar\u00e1n had rescued a nun who had been kidnapped and presumably raped by a local king.\u201cWhen the man of God returned to the monastery with the girl, she confessed that she was pregnant. Then the man of God, led by the zeal of justice, not wishing the serpent\u2019s seed to quicken, pressed down on her womb with the sign of the cross and forced her womb to be emptied.\u201d\u201cBefore Ciaran performs his miracle, there was a sense that what was in the womb wasn\u2019t fully human yet,\u201d says Callan. In Catholic teaching, human life begins when a fetus gains a human soul, an event known as ensoulment. However, the Church has no clear answer on when ensoulment happens.In the fifteenth century, St. Antonius, Archbishop of Florence, defended abortions that were medically necessary for a pregnant woman so long as they occured before ensoulment.The Church\u2019s longest held belief on this matter is one of \u201cdelayed hominization,\u201d or that a fetus could not gain a soul until it was \u201cformed.\u201d St. Thomas Aquinas, a major heavyweight in the Catholic Church in the 13th century, took after Aristotle and believed that being formed enough for ensoulment happened at around 40 days for males and about 80 days for females. More commonly, ensoulment was deemed to happen at the \u201cquickening,\u201d the moment when a pregnant woman first feels her child move, normally around 18 weeks into a pregnancy. While Catholic law frowned upon abortion, it ruled that it was only homicide if it occured after the fetus gained a human soul.Writings from the time show that abortion was a widespread and largely socially accepted practice, and in some cases, supported by church leaders. In the fifteenth century, St. Antonius, Archbishop of Florence, defended abortions that were medically necessary for a pregnant woman so long as they occured before ensoulment. Antonius wasn\u2019t a controversial figure. The pope at the time declared him to be a \u201cbrilliant theologian and a popular preacher,\u201d and Antonious\u2019 view was shared by many influential theologians.Things changed in the late 1580s when Pope Sixtus V came to power. Sixtus V was a notoriously harsh man. Prior to his papacy, he was recalled from his role as the inquisitor general in Venice due to his intensity. In 1588, he issued a papal bull declaring that abortion at any stage of a pregnancy was homicide, and that the punishement was excommunication that could only be lifted by traveling to Rome to beg for forgiveness. However, Sixtus V seemed to be uninterested in enforcing this bull, and frequently granted special dispensations to bishops to handle matters themselves and did not wish for women who procurred abortions to be treated as if they had committed homicide.This hardline stance on abortion lasted only three years. In 1591 the new Pope Gregory XIV reversed the decision, declaring abortion to only be homicide if it took place after ensoulment, which he determined took place 166 days into a pregnancy, or well over halfway through the second trimester. This decision lasted for 278 years until Pope Pius IX reversed the decision yet again in 1869 and made abortion after conception a sin that automatically excommunicated those involved in its procurement from the Catholic Church. There are only nine sins that have automatic excommunication as a punishment. This new ruling elevated abortion to the same level of sinfullness as punching the pope.In other words, typewriters, electric batteries, and elevators were all invented before the Catholic Church hardened its stance on abortion. Pope Pius IX didn\u2019t change the Church\u2019s stance on abortion, however, because he believed that ensoulment happened at conception. Rather, he believed that conception gave the potential for ensoulment, and that that potential must be protected. For some, this argument is wildly unpersuasive. Daniel Maguire, a professor emeritus of theological ethics at Marquette University, a Catholic institution, wrote in The Religious Consultation on Population, Reproductive Health & Ethics, \u201cThe argument is heard that the fetus is \u2018potential life.\u2019 That's wrong. It's real life. It just has not reached personal status. It is potentially a person, but the potential is not actual. After all, gentle reader, you and I are potentially dead but would not like to be treated as if that potentiality were fulfilled.\u201dHe goes on to say, \u201cThere may be serious and justifying reasons for killing pre-personal, fetal life. The decision on that belongs naturally to the woman who carries that life. Women have a far better track record than men when it comes to cherishing and protecting life. Let's leave abortion decisions up to them\u201dFor some, the primacy of conscience gives sufficient room within the Catholic Church for individuals to make up their own minds on abortion.Even though Catholicism is a religion with a strict and prominent hierarchy, it has a deep respect for individual reason and choice. When navigating complex moral questions, a person must first look to their own conscience to find the correct answer \u2014 not Church leaders. This principle is known as the \u201cprimacy of conscience,\u201d and the Catechism goes further to say, \u201cA human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience.\u201d This emphasis on personal reason is so important that when Pope Francis was recently accused of spreading heresy for valuing individual conscience over established church teaching, he doubled down and said, \u201cThe primacy of conscience must always be respected.\u201dFor some, the primacy of conscience gives sufficient room within the Catholic Church for individuals to make up their own minds on abortion. It\u2019s the principle behind Catholics for Choice (CFC), a nonprofit made up of Catholics who advocate for access to abortion and contraception from a Catholic standpoint. While the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops routinely rejects CFC\u2019s identification as a Catholic organization, its views are far more representative of practicing American Catholics.But while a majority of America\u2019s 51 million Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, their views are not advocated for by the Church hierarchy. And for non-Catholics, this has consequences.Catholics only make up 22 percent of the U.S. population, but one in six of our hospital beds are in a Catholic facility, a number that has increased 22 percent since 2001. Catholic hospitals follow a set of directives about healthcare from the U.S. Conference of Bishops. These directives forbid their hospitals from providing contraception, sterilization, many infertility treatments, and abortion care, even when a woman is not Catholic and her life and health are in danger.Saying that being pro-choice is incompatible with being Catholic reflects a very narrow understanding Catholic history and theology. Catholicism is complex, and so are Catholics. A vast majority of Catholics practice behaviors denounced by the Catholic hierarchy, such as using birth control, having oral sex, and supporting abortion, while still practicing Catholicism faithfully. Maybe it\u2019s time for them to include prayers to St. Brigid and St. Antonius while they do so.
