She has diverse experience in sales and account management within the pharmaceutical and medical device industry across a range of specialties including diabetes, cognitive deficiencies, and plastic and reconstructive surgery. Within Springboard Kristen aids in the execution of Springboard\u2019s signature accelerator programs, focusing on the Tech and Health Innovation Hubs. She has a concentration on strategically growing and managing Springboard\u2019s expert network, as well as leading their women\u2019s health initiatives.\nWe spoke to her about the Women\u2019s Health Innovation Coalition, its focus and plans and of course also asked her to share some information about Springboard Enterprises\u2019 other programs in support of founders in the women\u2019s health innovation space.\nHi Kristen! Thanks for making time for this. To start: What is the Women\u2019s Health Innovation Coalition and why did Springboard Enterprises decide to initiate it? What are the goals of the group?\n\u00a0The Women\u2019s Health Innovation Coalition brings together innovators, investors, clinicians, analysts, and executives with the shared goal of advancing innovation in women\u2019s health. We take a holistic approach to women\u2019s health\u2014taking into consideration not only gynecological, reproductive, and sexual health but looking beyond that to encompass any other diseases and conditions that either solely, predominately, or differently impact women. Through this lens, we have developed a framework of seven sectors: autoimmune, bone health, oncology, gynecological & reproductive health, heart health, cognitive & brain health. As a result, our partners operate across these sectors and more.\nSpringboard Enterprises has been putting significant energy into the women\u2019s health space over the past year. As part of this, we hosted a few in-person women\u2019s health roundtables ranging from loose market landscape discussions to more tailored discussions about innovation and investments within certain sectors (e.g. reproductive health, heart health, etc). It was suggested that we create an online portal to serve as a collective voice in order to drive innovation, research, and investments in women\u2019s health. We realized there are so many individuals and organizations passionate about advancing the space, so we sought to create a community and streamline all these amazing resources.\nThe new coalition unites a rather diverse group of organizations. What projects are planned? And how will they cooperate?\nOne thing that is particularly unique about this coalition is its holistic approach to women\u2019s health. Traditionally, women\u2019s health has operated through a monolithic view making the health of women rather fragmented. Through our previous roundtables, we see that there is tremendous value in the cross-pollination of these different specialties and expertise. The goal for the coalition is two-pronged: we seek to raise visibility of the partners, their solutions, and resources for women\u2019s health, while additionally continuing these roundtables virtually to foster discussions and address matters within the space. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since the Women\u2019s Health Innovation Coalition was announced. What has been the feedback so far?\nIt has been overwhelmingly positive! Within the first week, our web submissions for those interesting in partnering doubled. I have also gotten feedback from various investors and entrepreneurs that this is well needed to propel the women\u2019s health space forward. By partnering with such a diverse group, not only is a collective voice stronger but by unifying so many important aspects (such as investment, policy, research, regulatory, and more) will enable us to build momentum and bring much-needed change to a formerly stagnant area. Those that are in the space are extremely passionate about what they do and I am excited to see what is in store for the future of women\u2019s health.\nCan organizations and companies still join the coalition? And if so, what are the prerequisites and what is the process?\n\u00a0Yes, we are still growing and expanding the coalition. The easiest way for those to express interest in becoming a coalition partner is through the \u201cPartner with Us\u201d web submission form on our website. I screen the submissions and reach out to set up an intro call where I learn more about the organization and their goals. The coalition brings diverse perspectives, so we are open to a variety of backgrounds but look to those already operating among the seven sector framework or have a focus on health innovation, investment, and research.\nBesides running the Women\u2019s Health Innovation Coalition, Springboard runs a number of other programs in support of female founders and entrepreneurs in the women\u2019s health space. Can you share an overview?\nYes, of course! Springboard runs accelerator programs for women-led business and women entrepreneurs operating in the technology and life science space. This year we are running two Health Innovation Hub tracks\u2014the first track is in Life Sciences, such as therapeutics, diagnostics, and medical devices and the second track will be for Digital Health solutions. Companies seeking growth funding, connections to experts, and strategic partners for development and expansion are encouraged to apply. The selected Hub companies take part in a 3-day in-person bootcamp, followed by a virtual advisory period. These personal advisory teams are tasked with providing meaningful impact on the company\u2019s next stage of growth.\nThis year we have a special focus on women\u2019s health innovation and are currently in the middle of our Life Science track. We have converted this program to a virtual format due to COVID, which has enabled us to engage even more of our expert network throughout the program! Applications for the Digital Health track will be opening in Q3.\u00a0\n \n \n\n\nYou May Also Like\n \n\n \n\nEcosystem\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust 27, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFemtech Events: September 2020\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEcosystem, Fertility, News, Reproductive Health\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2, 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nUK Fertility Startup Fertifa Raises a \u00a31M Seed Round Led by Passion Capital\n\n \n\n\n \n\nWritten By\n\n\n                Kathrin Folkendt            \n\n\nKathrin Folkendt is the Founder & CEO of Femtech Insider, the globally leading publication on all things femtech.
