By contrast, the largest proportion (44%) want abortion to be available on demand.\nMeanwhile, after much pressure to take a stance on this issue, Poland\u2019s main opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO), has today issued a new position on abortion. It favours not just returning to the previous status quo, but liberalising access to terminations.\n\n\nFrom a Polityka survey of Polish women of reproductive age.\n44% think abortion should be permitted on demand up to 12th week.38% support the status quo prior to the ruling of the \u2018Constitutional Tribunal\u2019.2% agree with the ruling.7% think abortion should be banned outright. pic.twitter.com/q9yyrjg06G\n\u2014 Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) February 17, 2021\n\nIn the new Kantar poll for\u00a0Polityka \u2013 the first to look specifically at the women most directly affected by the abortion law \u2013 a plurality of 44% expressed the view that abortion should be available on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy.\nA further 38% said that they support the status quo prior to the recent change, when pregnancies could be terminated in three cases: if they threatened the mother\u2019s life or health, if they resulted from rape or incest, or if the foetus suffered from severe defects.\nOnly 2% said that they support the current situation, introduced by a Constitutional Tribunal ruling that banned the last of those three options (which made up almost all legal terminations in Poland). A further 7% want a complete ban on abortion and 9% did not express a position.\nWhile 90% of respondents said that women carrying foetuses with fatal defects should be allowed an abortion, 67% agreed that the procedure should also be allowed if the foetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome (as it was before the recent ruling). Over a quarter (27%) said it should not be permitted for cases of Down syndrome.\n\nMajority of Poles support abortion protests and popularity of ruling party has dropped, polls show\n\nPolling has consistently shown that, among the Polish population as a whole, a large majority oppose the anti-abortion ruling and support the mass protests that have emerged in opposition to it. However, most favour a return to the previous status quo rather than a liberalisation of access to abortion.\nThe new Kantar poll of women finds that the youngest respondents (aged 18 to 24) were the most strongly in favour liberalisation, with 57% supporting abortion on demand and 29% favouring a return to the previous status quo.\nLikewise, 60% women in urban areas want abortion to be available on demand while 35% support a return to the status quo. In more rural areas, which are generally more conservative, the figures are 37% and 39% respectively.\nParticipants in the abortion protests have been disproportionately urban and young. A recent study by CBOS \u2013 a state-linked research agency \u2013 found that young Poles are now more likely to hold left-wing views than centrist or right-wing ones for the first time in Poland\u2019s post-communist history.\n\nLeft-wing views highest ever recorded among young Poles, above right-wing and centrist for first time\n\nMeanwhile, in the new Kantar poll, only 7% of the women surveyed said they believed that the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling was a decision it made independently. Exactly a quarter said it was due to pressure from the Catholic church, while 29% saw it as a result of an internal power struggle in the ruling camp.\nAlmost half (45%) said that the abortion issue would\u00a0influence their decisions in future elections. Notably, among young women who identified themselves as supporters of the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, almost half support either a return to the previous status quo (27%) or abortion on demand (20%).\nPiS has supported the tightening of the abortion law. Its leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, said that his party will \u201cstrive to ensure that even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is condemned to death, is severely deformed, will end in birth, so that the child can be christened, buried, given a name\u201d.\n\nAbortion protests aim \u201cto destroy Poland and end the history of the Polish nation\u201d, says Kaczy\u0144ski\n\nAmong young women who support the centrist Civic Coalition (which is led by PO), Kantar found that almost two thirds (64%) favour abortion being available on demand.\nPO, which encompasses both socially liberal and more conservative wings, has been under pressure to take a clearer stance on abortion since the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was issued last October.\nThe party had previously been in favour of the pre-ruling status quo. However, its leader, Borys Budka, recently said there can now be \u201cno return\u201d to that so-called \u201ccompromise\u201d. PO\u2019s deputy leader, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, likewise said that the \u201cpseudo-compromise has been buried by PiS\u201d.\nAt a press conference today, the party set out its new position. \u201cWe want the three conditions [for abortion] that were in force under the previous law to continue to apply, but we will also give the possibility of terminating pregnancy up to the 12th week in exceptional circumstances,\u201d said Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, who has been leading PO\u2019s committee working on a new position.\n\n\nKobiety musz\u0105 mie\u0107 prawo do podejmowania osobistej decyzji dotycz\u0105cej macierzy\u0144stwa w zgodzie z w\u0142asnym sumieniem.

Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska (@M_K_Blonska) February 18, 2021\n\nThe party says it wants abortions to be available up to the 12th week for women who have an \u201cextremely difficult personal situation\u201d and \u201cafter consultation with a psychologist and a doctor\u201d, reports Onet.\nIn its package, PO also called for the state to guarantee sex education, free access to contraception and IVF, and prescription-free morning-after pills. PiS has opposed sex education, cut state funding for IVF, and made emergency contraceptives available only on prescription.\n\u201cWe reject the radicalisms of the left and the right,\u201d tweeted the head of PO\u2019s parliamentary caucus. \u201cWe need a new social contract.\u201d\nHowever, media reports based on inside sources have suggested that there may be a rebellion from PO\u2019s more conservative ranks over the new position of the leadership. Some are considering leaving the party completely, reports Wirtualna Polska.\n\n\nOdrzucamy radykalizmy z prawej i lewej strony.
