Floyd was later pronounced dead.\n\u201cMy friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life. At the same time, we have to recognize that \u2018the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,'\u201d he said, quoting Archbishop Jose H. Gomez of Los Angeles, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\nThe pope prayed for the intercession of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mother of America, to assist \u201call those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world. May God bless all of you and your families.\u201d\nHundreds of thousands of people turned out nationwide to protest Floyd\u2019s death. And many of the country\u2019s Catholic bishops joined the calls for justice.\nFour officers from the Minneapolis Police Department were fired May 26, including Derek Chauvin, with whom Floyd pleaded \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t breathe\u201d as he held him down. Chauvin is facing third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nCopyright \u00a92020 Catholic News Service/United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.
