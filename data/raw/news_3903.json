He also asked for the number of reported complications or mental health concerns from taking one or both pills at home, the impact on costs, and the number of emergency admissions since changes to procedures. \nAbortion is a keystone issue for women\u2019s equality, and we would expect anyone who champions equality to advocate for women\u2019s access to reproductive health services.Emma Ritch, ENGENDER\nFeminist organisation Engender suggested Balfour\u2019s stance on reproductive rights was at odds with his position as shadow equalities minister.\nSpeaking to The Ferret, director of Engender Emma Ritch said: \u201cAbortion is a keystone issue for women\u2019s equality, and we would expect anyone who champions equality to advocate for women\u2019s access to reproductive health services.\n\u201cEarly medical abortion at home simply removes the barriers facing some women who need to access reproductive healthcare. Continuing to allow early medical abortion at home does not remove the option for face-to-face appointments, rather it enables women and their doctors and nurses to make the right decision for them.\u201d\nRitch said current arrangements make access to abortion care easier for women in rural areas, women with additional caring responsibilities, and women in coercive relationships.\nShe added: \u201cUnfortunately, in Scotland as in all countries, there are those who seek to restrict women\u2019s access to abortion. The Covid-19 pandemic has seen very few signs for optimism, but the move to telemedical abortion healthcare was one of them \u2013 we must resist those who seek to undo this good work.\u201d\n\u2018Misinformation\u2019 on abortions\nAnti-abortion organisation Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), has mounted a campaign against the extension of remote abortions. SPUC previously sought to legally challenge the Scottish Government\u2019s decision to allow the second pill to be taken at home in 2017. But it was thrown out by the court and an appeal was rejected last year.\nSPUC said that home abortions mean \u201cthere is no way of ensuring the woman is alone during the telephone consultation, and is not being forced to order the pills\u201d.\nThe SPUC spokesperson raised concerns that women need to \u201cself-assess\u201d gestation and \u201cself-manage\u201d the administration and outcomes, and cited an example from England where a woman took the pills at 28 weeks, beyond the legal limit.\nEngender has produced a template response to the Scottish Government consultation with abortion care provider British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), Amnesty International and Abortion Rights Scotland. These groups argue that \u201cthe need to attend appointments in person may have complications for women with coercive and controlling partners \u2013 particularly where they have to account for their time or travel\u201d.\n\nSNP\u2019s mental health spokesperson voted against move to limit abortion clinic protests\n\nBalfour also asked about the number of meetings or communications the government held with BPAS in the last five years, and about the number of women to receive a \u201cpills by post\u201d abortion kit from BPAS since 31 March.\nBPAS is a charity which operates specialist clinics, the vast majority of which are in England and Wales.\nThe government confirmed it met with BPAS once in 2016 and once in 2019, and that a \u201csmall number\u201d of abortions in Scotland had been carried out using \u201cpills by post\u201d from BPAS but that \u201cthe great majority of abortions in Scotland are provided by NHS Boards\u201d.\nBPAS told The Ferret its services had been the subject of \u201ca concerted campaign of misinformation\u201d on social media, with \u201canti-choice users suggesting we are responsible for the deaths of women (as well as babies)\u201d.\nFollowing Balfour\u2019s questions, BPAS suggested the MSP consider its research, published this month, which found that the UK Government\u2019s two-child cap on benefits was a \u201csignificant factor in women\u2019s decision making around whether or not to continue a pregnancy\u201d.\nA BPAS spokesperson said: \u201cIf Mr Balfour is concerned about women feeling under pressure to end a pregnancy, we suggest he looks at his own party\u2019s policies.\nThey added: \u201cThe two-child limit removes the ability of some women to continue an otherwise wanted pregnancy, forcing them to choose between plunging their families in to further poverty or having an abortion,\u201d\nAnti-choice MSPs like Jeremy Balfour and John Mason are undermining women\u2019s access to healthcare and safe abortion. They are contributing to a culture of fear and intimidation.Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour\nScottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon commented: \u201cAbortion is healthcare, and all women should have the right to choose it.\n\u201cAnti-choice MSPs like Jeremy Balfour and John Mason are undermining women\u2019s access to healthcare and safe abortion. They are contributing to a culture of fear and intimidation.\u201d\nLennon added that \u201callowing early medical abortion at home has protected the safety of service users and healthcare workers during the pandemic\u201d.\nGlasgow Shettleston MSP John Mason made clear his opposition to remote abortions in a recent column in The Times, which argued the move is \u201cweakening safeguards and waiving safety concerns for some of the most vulnerable\u201d.\nResponding to criticisms of his position, Mason told The Ferret: \u201cI think even those who support abortions in principle can have reservations about these  abortions. There is less medical support involved and so they are clearly less safe than the previous system before Covid-19.\n\u201cNo one wants \u2018a culture of fear and intimidation\u2019. I certainly do not. However, we do know that some women are subjected to fear and intimidation by their partner (or other family members) who do not want the baby even if she does.\u201d\nMason added that he feared more generally that \u201cthe potential physical, mental, and emotional risks of having an abortion\u201d are too often \u201cnot spelled out\u201d to \u201cexpectant mothers\u201d.\nBalfour was contacted by The Ferret but declined to comment.\nPhoto thanks to Scottish Parliament TV.\nMore like this\n\n\nUniversity chaplain calls Pride a \u2018gross offence to God\u2019\n\n\nCatholic church told to shut down gay conversion therapy groups\n\n\nUS Christian right \u2018dark money\u2019 backed anti-abortion Glasgow students\n\n\nSNP\u2019s mental health spokesperson voted against move to limit abortion clinic protests\n\n\n\nShareTweetSubscribe\n\n\n\nabortionCovid-19EngenderScottish GovernmentScottish Parliament\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
