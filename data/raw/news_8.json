(Photo by Ashton Pittman.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi\u2019s \u2018Copy and Paste\u2019 Abortion Ban: Governor Shared Plan with Radio Host in Advance\u200b \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshton Pittman \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nApril 12, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mississippi neared 2,000 last Tuesday, the state\u2019s governor, Tate Reeves, was preoccupied with another matter: how to use the unfolding novel coronavirus crisis as a way to temporarily close down the state\u2019s only abortion clinic.\nThe answer arrived late that afternoon, when the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans allowed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s own\u00a0March 22 executive order\u00a0shutting down the Lone Star State\u2019s abortion clinics to take effect. Earlier, a federal court had granted a stay after abortion-rights organizations filed suit, temporarily\u00a0blocking the order from taking effect.\nReeves got hold of\u00a0the 47-page ruling\u00a0on April 7, the same evening the ruling came down. Abbott\u2019s order forced health-care professionals to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not immediately necessary,\u201d including abortion clinics. The Texas order passed constitutional muster, the majority on a three-judge panel ruled, because preserving personal protective equipment, or PPE, aligned with \u201cthe state\u2019s critical interest in protecting the public health\u201d during a pandemic.\nAbbott\u2019s order, the panel said, did not appear to specifically target women\u2019s right to have an abortion; it targeted all \u201celective surgeries,\u201d the judges wrote.\nBut the Mississippi governor would quickly make it clear on conservative talk radio that he saw the ruling as an opening to shut down the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization in the capital city, which he had spent the past eight years trying to do as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor and Senate president. Federal courts, including the 5th Circuit, have repeatedly blocked those efforts, though, including last year when the federal appeals court blocked a six-week abortion ban that Reeves championed in 2019.\nThis Texas ruling, Reeves argued, could serve as a \u201cguideline\u201d to finally stop abortions in the state\u2014at least temporarily.\nThe Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization is Mississippi\u2019s only remaining abortion clinic. Photo by Ashton Pittman.\nLive from Tupelo, Reeves Explains Ban Strategy\n\u201cAs soon as we got it, our lawyers have been reviewing it, looking at it, because we want to make sure we have a similar order that meets the guidelines as set forth by the court,\u201d the Magnolia State\u2019s governor\u00a0told American Family Radio host Tim Wildmon\u00a0about the 5th Circuit\u2019s order in an interview the next day, on April 8.\n\u201cBecause one of the things we have found over the years is that Mississippi\u2019s laws would ensure that we are the safest place in America for an unborn child. That\u2019s something we want to continue, but now we have guidance.\u201d\n\u201cI would just copy and paste it,\u201d suggested\u00a0Wildmon, who is also the president of the Tupelo, Miss.-based American Family Association,\u00a0whose organization the Southern Poverty Law Center designates as a hate group\u00a0for its crusade against gay rights and on other \u201ctraditional moral values\u201d fronts.\nThe host\u2019s suggestion elicited a chuckle from Reeves, who said he was already thinking along those lines, and that his order could come within a day.\n\u201cI have been talking to our lawyers. We have been cutting and pasting Texas\u2019 order, with the exception of that fact that we have slightly different state laws, so our order has to comply with our state laws when compared to Texas\u2019, but yes, we have every intention of having an order that is in line, that meets the guidelines as set forth in the 47-page order yesterday by the 5th Circuit.\u201d\nThe next day, on Friday afternoon, Reeves followed through, announcing\u00a0Executive Order No. 1470\u00a0with a statement titled, \u201cGovernor Reeves Issues Executive Orders to Protect Healthcare Professionals.\u201d\n\u201cWe are so blessed to have our nation\u2019s best and brightest in our state\u2019s health-care system, and I thank these heroes for caring for Mississippians as we work to slow the spread of COVID-19,\u201d Reeves said in the April 9 statement. \u201cWhile they\u2019re fighting to protect us, we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to protect them.\u201d\nParts of Reeves\u2019 order are identical to Abbott\u2019s, including the portion that claims it is necessary to preserve medical protective equipment that would \u201cbe depleted by surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the life of a patient, contrary to recommendations from the President\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force, the CDC, the U.S. Surgeon General, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\u201d\nA further depletion of PPE, both orders state, \u201cwould hinder efforts to cope with the COVID-19 disaster.\u201d\nWildmon: \u2018About the Abortion Clinic in Jackson\u2019\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said his lawyers crafted his April 9 executive order temporarily banning \u201celective\u201d procedures, including most abortions, partly by copying and pasting from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s own March 22 order.\nNeither Reeves\u2019 statement nor Order No. 1470 itself mentions abortion, though the announcement notes that \u201cGovernor Reeves issued this order to ensure that PPE and medical supplies would not be depleted by medically unnecessary surgeries, as well as to protect the health and safety of health care professionals needed to help in COVID-19 response.\u201d\nDuring his interview with Wildmon the day before, though, Reeves never mentioned the need to protect health-care workers or to preserve PPE. \u201cBasically, our discussion here is about the abortion clinic in Jackson, the one we have in the state,\u201d Wildmon said as he opened the interview, noting that \u201cMississippi is a very pro-life state\u201d and \u201cGovernor Reeves is a very pro-life governor.\u201d\nThroughout, Reeves only identified abortion as the impetus for issuing his own version of the Texas order.\nDuring a live-streamed press conference shortly after issuing the order the next afternoon, though, Reeves avoided mentioning abortion. \u201cWe have to make sure we have adequate supplies of PPE so that health-care workers can safely tend to those patients that are in our hospitals,\u201d the Republican governor told members of the press.\nWhen one reporter asked if the order would close the abortion clinic, Reeves suggested it would without directly answering the question.\n\u201cIt shuts down all elective surgeries,\u201d he replied simply.\nBut the order could have had the effect of ending most abortions in the state for two weeks, except those necessary to \u201cpreserve the life of a patient.\u201d\nMississippi Women as \u2018Political Pawns\u2019\nIn a statement Friday evening, Staci Fox, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, sharply criticized Reeves\u2019 order.\n\u201cWomen in Mississippi should not be used as political pawns at any time and especially during this pandemic. Safe and legal abortion care has always been essential, and must remain so during this public health crisis,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe stand with Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization as they are delivering this essential care during a public health crisis.\u201d\nJudge Carlton Reeves\u2019 letter.\nThe next day, on Saturday, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton W. Reeves, the federal judge in Jackson who has been the first to hear each of several lawsuits against the State of Mississippi over laws targeting abortion rights in recent years, preemptively sent a letter to lawyers representing the State and JWHO, the abortion clinic.\n\u201cAt this moment, it seems reasonable to expect plaintiffs to challenge the abortion restrictions in yesterday\u2019s Executive Order, and that challenge will be brought within this case. \u2026 Before we go down that expensive and time-consuming path, I wanted to write and see if there was another way forward,\u201d Judge Reeves wrote. In the letter, he pointed to a court battle in Alabama over its own attempts to limit abortion access during the pandemic.\nEach time Judge Reeves, a Barack Obama appointee, has heard an abortion case, he has ruled against the State, striking down a\u00a0ban on abortions after 15 weeks in 2018\u00a0and blocking the State\u2019s so-called \u201cheartbeat law,\u201d which\u00a0bans abortions after about six weeks\u2019 gestation, last May.\nThe judge, eager to avoid another abortion case, wrote in his letter that Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs could \u201chelp us all avoid all the litigation and upheaval our sister state has experienced\u201d by clarifying whether or not the order will force JWHO to cease operations.\nIn a footnote, Reeves offered a more personal clarification: \u201cFor any out of state readers, no, Governor Reeves and I are not related. Mississippi is small, but not that small.\u201d\nGov. Reeves previously signaled his intent to ban abortions amidst the coronavirus crisis during\u00a0a late March press conference alongside Dobbs. When a reporter asked Dobbs about it, though, he said he was \u201cnot familiar with\u201d the issue, and would want to \u201creview the situation a bit more.\u201d Dobbs has not clarified since. When Gov. Reeves issued the order on April 9, though, he said he did so in coordination with Dobbs and the Mississippi State Department of Health.\nAt the time Gov. Reeves sent his letter on Saturday, no outlets had reported on Gov. Reeves\u2019 comments to American Family Radio on April 7. Even if Reeves ultimately struck down the governor\u2019s order, the case would go to the 5th Circuit, which would likely allow it to take effect because of its similarity to the Texas one. The 5th Circuit hears cases originating in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n\n5th Circuit: \u2018Under the Pressure of Great Dangers\u2019\nIn its ruling, the 5th Circuit judges cited a 1905 U.S. Supreme Court case, Jacobson v. Commonwealth. In that case, the nation\u2019s highest court considered a man\u2019s claim that a mandatory vaccination law enacted amid a smallpox epidemic in Cambridge, Mass., violated his 14th Amendment right \u201cto care for his own body and health in such way as to him seems best.\u201d The court ruled in favor of the State in that case.\n\u201cUnder the pressure of great dangers,\u201d the government can restrict constitutional rights \u201cas the safety of the general public may demand,\u201d the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905.\nIn its April 7 ruling, the 5th Circuit cited Jacobson as precedent.\n\u201cThat settled rule allows the state to restrict, for example, one\u2019s right to peaceably assemble, to publicly worship, to travel, and even to leave one\u2019s home. The right to abortion is no exception,\u201d the 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling reads.\nThe 5th Circuit also cited another Supreme Court ruling, Prince v. Massachusetts in 1944, which found that the \u201cright to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community \u2026 to communicable diseases.\u201d\nThough Mississippi\u2019s governor appears to accept the idea that the Jacobson ruling allows states to restrict abortion, which the Supreme Court ruled is a \u201cfundamental right\u201d in 1973, Reeves has resisted the idea that it allows government to restrict other rights.\nIn March, he issued an executive order that defines houses of worship and gun shops as \u201cessential services\u201d that local governments cannot force to close amid the pandemic. When Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons ordered churches in his town to stop holding in-person or drive-in services earlier this month,\u00a0Reeves was incensed, writing on Facebook that the move was \u201coutrageous\u201d and risked a \u201crevolt.\u201d The governor even suggested that Greenville had \u201ctrampled on the Constitution.\u201d\n\u2018Unclear How PPE Is Consumed in Medication Abortions\u2019\nThe 5th Circuit\u2019s April 7 ruling notes that Abbott\u2019s order, GA-09, was different from the Mississippi restrictions it blocked in 2018 and 2019, which the justices refer to as \u201cJackson I\u201d and \u201cJackson II\u201d in the ruling. Those laws totally banned abortions after a certain gestational period with exceptions only for extreme cases.\n\u201cGA-09 only delays certain non-essential abortions. GA-09 thus differs from the regulations in Jackson II and III in three key respects. First, GA-09 expires on April 21, 2020, three weeks after its effective date. Second, GA-09 includes an emergency exception for the mother\u2019s life and death, based on the determination of the administering physician. Third, GA-09 contains a separate exception for \u2018any procedure\u2019 that, if performed under normal clinical standards, \u2018would not deplete the hospital capacity or the personal protective equipment needed to cope with the COVID-19 disaster.\u2019\u201d\nReeves\u2019 April 9 executive order, similarly, makes an exception for \u201cany procedure that, if performed in accordance with the commonly accepted standard of clinical practice, would not have the potential to deplete the hospital capacity, medical equipment or PPE needed to cope with the COVID-19 disaster.\u201d\nIn Mississippi, most abortions are \u201cmedication abortions\u201d that take place at 16 weeks or prior, and only involve taking a pill, not a surgical procedure. The 5th Circuit wrote that its review found that \u201csurgical abortions consume PPE,\u201d but \u201cthe record is unclear how PPE is consumed in medication abortions.\u201d\nIn proceedings, opponents of Abbott\u2019s order said PPE is not used in \u201cproviding the pills,\u201d the justices noted, but the State pointed out that Texas law \u201crequires a physical examination, ultrasound and follow-up visits,\u201d all of which consume PPE, including gloves and masks. Like Texas, Mississippi law requires women to submit to an ultrasound before having an abortion.\n\n\nA copyleaks.com analysis of Gov. Tate Reeves\u2019 April 9 executive order (left) shows that about 27% of its language is lifted partially or directly from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s March 22 order on the right. Courtesy copyleaks.com.\n\nJudge Dennis: \u2018I Respectfully But Emphatically Dissent\u2019\nThe judges in the majority for the 5th Circuit\u2019s April 8 ruling were Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan, whom Republican President Donald Trump appointed, and Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, whom former Republican President George W. Bush appointed.\nThe only Democratic-appointed judge on the 5th Circuit\u2019s three-judge panel, James L. Dennis, a Bill Clinton appointee, wrote a dissent. Because Texas (like Mississippi), limits how far into a pregnancy a woman can have an abortion, Dennis wrote, the law risks effectively prohibiting some women from exercising their right to an abortion.\nAnd despite the majority\u2019s satisfaction that the governor did not single out abortion, he wrote, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a new release the day after Abbott\u2019s order specifying that the prohibitions include \u201cany type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life of the mother.\u201d\nPaxton reiterated that position to American Family Radio Host Wildmon on April 8, minutes before Gov. Reeves joined the program.\nJudge Dennis also took issue with the majority\u2019s use of Jacobson v. Massachusetts to justify its position. That ruling, Dennis pointed out, required that any actions curtailing rights be \u201cjustified by the necessities of the case\u201d and not violate rights \u201cunder the guise of exerting a police power.\u201d\nThough PPE, such as gloves, \u201cmay be used at pre- and post-procedure appointments,\u201d Dennis wrote, that argument \u201cmistakenly assumes that a patient unable to obtain an abortion will not otherwise need medical care that requires the consumption of PPE,\u201d since prenatal care and childbirth consume \u201cexponentially more PPE than an abortion.\u201d\n\u201cDenying pregnant patients access to abortion now may simply change the purpose for which PPE is used, without any surplus that is able to be reallocated to health care workers,\u201d Dennis wrote.\nAbbott\u2019s order, the dissenting judge wrote, does not seem related to its stated goal of preserving PPE.\n\u201cIn a time where panic and fear already consume our daily lives, the majority\u2019s opinion inflicts further panic and fear on women in Texas by depriving them, without justification, of their constitutional rights, exposing them to the risks of continuing an unwanted pregnancy, as well as the risks of traveling to other states in search of time-sensitive medical care. I respectfully but emphatically dissent,\u201d Dennis concludes.\nFox: \u2018We Must Continue to Trust Women and Doctors\u2019\nOn Saturday, the Center for Reproductive Rights, a Washington, D.C.-based legal group, filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the Texas plaintiffs\u2019 behalf, asking the court reinstate a stay on Abbott\u2019s order, warning that \u201cvirtually all Texas residents with unplanned pregnancies are unable to access early abortion care through medication abortion and must instead wait until they reach a more advanced stage of pregnancy.\u201d That, the plaintiffs argue, will only require \u201cmore health care\u201d in the long run and incentivize out-of-state travel.\u201d Hundreds of women have already been turned away, the appeal application claims.\nEven before the Texas order,\u00a0The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released\u00a0a joint statement on March 18, calling abortion an \u201cessential component of comprehensive health care\u201d that is \u201ctime-sensitive.\u201d\nAfter Gov. Reeves issued his order on April 9, Fox, the Planned Parenthood Southeast director, pointed to that statement as she urged Mississippi leaders not to block access to abortion rights.\n\u201cWhile we are all concerned about this global pandemic, we must continue to trust women and their doctors informed by public health experts to make these health care decisions, not politicians,\u201d Fox said on Friday.\nReeves\u2019 order, unless extended or blocked in court, is set to expire on April 27 at 8 a.m.\nUpdate: After the Mississippi Free Press first published this story, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals made an additional ruling, allowing medication abortions to continue in Texas. Since, Gov. Reeves has not publicly pushed the issue in Mississippi and the Jackson clinic has continued providing abortions.\nInformation on coronavirus prevention measures is available at the University of Mississippi Medical center\u2019s website at\u00a0umc.edu/coronavirus\u00a0and at\u00a0cdc.gov/coronavirus.\nThe Mississippi Free Press\u00a0has an interactive map showing diagnosed coronavirus cases across the state and one showing the number of ICU beds in counties across the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshton Pittman \n\n\nAward-winning News Editor Ashton Pittman, a native of the South Mississippi Pine Belt, studied journalism and political science at the University of Southern Mississippi.
