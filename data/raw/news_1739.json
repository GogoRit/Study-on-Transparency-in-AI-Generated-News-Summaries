fueling a sudden spike in infant mortality as women are forced to carry nonviable pregnancies to term.  \n    \n\n            Some 2,200 infants died in Texas in 2022 \u2013 an increase of 227 deaths, or 11.5%, over the previous year, according to preliminary infant mortality data from the Texas Department of State Health Services that CNN obtained through a public records request. Infant deaths caused by severe genetic and birth defects rose by 21.6%. That spike reversed a nearly decade-long decline. Between 2014 and 2021, infant deaths had fallen by nearly 15%. \n    \n\n            In 2021, Texas banned abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. When the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. \n    \n\n            The increase in deaths could partly be explained by the fact that more babies are being born in Texas. One recent report found that in the final nine months of 2022, the state saw nearly 10,000 more births than expected prior to its abortion ban \u2013 an estimated 3% increase. \n    \n\n            But multiple obstetrician-gynecologists who focus on high-risk pregnancies told CNN that Texas\u2019 strict abortion laws likely contributed to the uptick in infant deaths.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters march in the street during an abortion-rights rally on June 25, 2022 in Austin, Texas. \n\nSergio Flores/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas sued by women who say state's abortion bans put their health at risk\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cWe all knew the infant mortality rate would go up, because many of these terminations were for pregnancies that don\u2019t turn into healthy normal kids,\u201d said Dr. Erika Werner, the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we all were concerned about.\u201d  \n    \n\n            The issue of forcing women to carry out terminal and often high-risk pregnancies is at the core of a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, with several women \u2013 who suffered difficult pregnancies or infant deaths shortly after giving birth \u2013 testifying in Travis County court this week. \n    \n\n            One witness became so emotional while testifying Wednesday that she began to vomit on the stand. \n    \n\n            After the court called a recess she explained that the reaction is a response to the emotional trauma she endured: \u201cI vomit when there\u2019s certain parts that happen that kind of just makes my body remember.\u201d\n    \n\n            Another sobbed as she described feeling afraid to visit a Texas doctor after receiving an abortion out of state. A third spoke tearfully about waiting for her baby\u2019s heart to stop beating so her doctors could provide an abortion she desperately needed.\n    \n\n            Prior to the recent abortion restrictions, Texas banned the procedure after 20 weeks. This law gave parents more time to learn crucial information about a fetus\u2019s brain formation and organ development, which doctors begin to test for at around 15 weeks. \n    \n\n            Samantha Casiano, a plaintiff in the suit filed against Texas, wished she\u2019d had more time to make the decision.\n    \n\n            \u201cIf I was able to get the abortion with that time, I think it would have meant a lot to me because my daughter wouldn\u2019t have suffered,\u201d Casiano told CNN after testifying Wednesday.\n    \n\n    \u2018You have no options\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion demonstrators gather in the rotunda at the Capitol in Austin, Texas, in March of 2021.\n\nJay Janner/Austin American-Statesman/AP\n\n\n\n            When Casiano was 20 weeks pregnant, a routine scan came back with devastating news: Her baby would be stillborn or die shortly after birth.\n    \n\n            The fetus had anencephaly, a rare birth defect that keeps the brain and skull from developing during pregnancy. Babies with this condition are often stillborn, though they sometimes live a few hours or days. Many women around the country who face the prospect choose abortion,  two obstetrician-gynecologists told CNN. \n    \n\n            But Casiano lived in Texas, where state legislators had recently banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. She couldn\u2019t afford to travel out of the state for the procedure.  \n    \n\n            \u201cYou have no options. You will have to go through with your pregnancy,\u201d Casiano\u2019s doctor told her, she claimed in the lawsuit. \n    \n\n            In March, Casiano gave birth to her daughter Halo. After gasping for air for four hours, the baby died, Casiano said during her testimony on Wednesday. \n    \n\n            \u201cAll she could do was fight to try to get air. I had to watch my daughter go from being pink to red to purple. From being warm to cold,\u201d said Casiano. \u201cI just kept telling myself and my baby that I\u2019m so sorry that this had to happen to you.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Casiano and 14 others \u2013 including two doctors \u2013 are plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They allege the abortion ban has denied them or their patients access to necessary obstetrical care. The plaintiffs are asking the courts to clarify when doctors can make medical exceptions to the state\u2019s ban.\n    \n\n            Casiano and two other plaintiffs testified Wednesday about hoping to deliver healthy babies but instead learning their lives or pregnancies were in danger. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Plaintiffs Anna Zargarian, Lauren Miller, Lauren Hall, and Amanda Zurawski at the Texas State Capitol after filing a lawsuit on behalf of Texans harmed by the state's abortion ban on March 7 in Austin, Texas. \n\nRick Kern/Getty Images/FILE\n\n\n\n            \u201cThis was just supposed to be a scan day,\u201d Casiano told the court. \u201cIt escalated to me finding out my daughter was going to die.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Lawyers representing the state argued Wednesday that the plaintiffs\u2019 doctors were to blame, saying they misinterpreted the law and failed to provide adequate care for such high-risk pregnancies. \n    \n\n            \u201cPlaintiffs will not and cannot provide any evidence of any medical provider in the state of Texas being prosecuted or otherwise penalized for performance of an abortion using the emergency medical exemption,\u201d a lawyer said during the state\u2019s opening statement. \n    \n\n            Kylie Beaton, another plaintiff, also had to watch her baby die. Beaton, who didn\u2019t testify this week, learned during a 20-week scan that something was wrong with her baby\u2019s brain, according to the suit. \n    \n\n            The doctor diagnosed the fetus with alobar holoprosencephaly, a condition where the two hemispheres of the brain don\u2019t properly divide. Babies with this condition are often stillborn or die soon after birth.  \n    \n\n            Beaton\u2019s doctor told her he couldn\u2019t provide an abortion unless she was severely ill, or the fetus\u2019s heart stopped. Beaton and her husband sought to obtain an abortion out of state. However, the fetus\u2019s head was enlarged due to its condition, and the only clinic that would perform an abortion charged up to $15,000. Beaton and her husband couldn\u2019t afford it.  \n    \n\n            Instead, Beaton gave birth to a son she named Grant. The baby cried constantly, wouldn\u2019t eat, and couldn\u2019t be held upright for fear it would put too much pressure on his head, according to the suit. Four days later, Grant died.  \n    \n\n    Maternal mortality \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Zurawski of Austin, Texas, center, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP\n\n\n\n            Experts say that abortion bans in states like Texas lead to increased risk for both babies and mothers. \n    \n\n            Maternal mortality has long been a top concern for doctors and health-rights activists. Even before the Supreme Court decision, the United States had the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations, one study found. \n    \n\n            Amanda Zurawski, the lawsuit\u2019s lead plaintiff, testified Wednesday that her water broke 18 weeks into her pregnancy, putting her at high risk for a life-threatening infection. Zurawski\u2019s baby likely wouldn\u2019t survive.  \n    \n\n            But the fetus still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said they were unable to terminate the pregnancy. She received an emergency abortion only after her condition worsened and she went into septic shock. \n    \n\n            Zurawski described during Wednesday\u2019s hearing how her family visited the hospital, fearing it would be the last time they would see her. Zurawski has argued that had she been able to obtain an abortion, her life wouldn\u2019t have been in jeopardy in the same way. \n    \n\n            \u201cI blame the people who support these bans,\u201d Zurawski said.  \n    \n\n            Zurawski previously said the language in Texas\u2019 abortion laws is \u201cincredibly vague, and it leaves doctors grappling with what they can and cannot do, what health care they can and cannot provide.\u201d \n    \n\n            Pregnancy is dangerous, and forcing a woman to carry a non-viable pregnancy to term is unnecessarily risky when it\u2019s clear the baby will not survive, argued Dr. Mae-Lan Winchester, an Ohio maternal-fetal medicine specialist.  \n    \n\n            \u201cPregnancy is one of the most dangerous things a person will ever go through,\u201d Winchester said. \u201cPutting yourself through that risk without any benefit of taking a baby home at the end, it\u2019s \u2026 risking maternal morbidity and mortality for nothing.\u201d \n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Casey Tolan and Daniel A.
