LEAVEN PHOTO BY MARC ANDERSONBut he wasn\u2019t there to\ntalk about the Super Bowl.\u201cI do not think it is a\nclich\u00e9,\u201d he said, \u201cto say we are in a life and death battle for the truth and\nauthentic dignity of the human person. We need your full attention. You need to\ndrop what you\u2019re doing and join us.\u201dLikewise, Archbishop Joseph F.\u00a0 Naumann, in his brief remarks, focused on the progress yet to be made on pro-life issues, both locally and nationally.\u201cI think we\u2019re here tonight to kind of encourage each other, to support each other, to win this victory for the unborn,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s this victory for the soul of our state and nation.\u201dArchbishop Naumann gave brief remarks at the Valentine\u2019s Day banquet. LEAVEN PHOTO BY MARC ANDERSONAs part of the evening,\nMary Kay Culp, executive director of Kansans for Life and member of Holy\nTrinity Parish in Lenexa, was honored by a brief video highlighting her\ninvolvement with the pro-life movement for more than 40 years.The organization also\nhonored former Kansas Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook, a member of St. Joseph Parish in\nShawnee, for her efforts to found the Kansas Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center.\u201cI am so humbled by this award, so appreciative,\u201d she said, fighting back tears. \u201cKansans for Life has been in the fight and has helped me all along the way. Dr. [David] Prentice, he\u2019s the one that deserves all the accolades.

I couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201dMary Pilcher-Cook was honored at the banquet for her efforts to found the Kansas Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center. LEAVEN PHOTO BY MARC ANDERSONTim Tebow, the 2007\nHeisman Trophy winner and former Denver Broncos quarterback, gave the keynote.\u201cIt is such an honor to\nbe here,\u201d Tebow said, thanking the archbishop, the politicians and Culp for\ntheir work. Tebow also thanked Hunt for his courage in promoting the gospel of\nlife.\u201cIt really does mean a\nlot more than winning the Super Bowl,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day, when you look back\nand people are talking about you, what are you going to be known for? Are you\ngoing to say Super Bowl, or we saved a lot of babies?\u201d\u201cI thought it was\neverything,\u201d Tebow said of the role sports played in his life until his first\nmission trip at age 15. On that trip, he met a boy named Sherwin whose legs and feet were\nbackwards due to a birth defect.The encounter made him\nrealize that, although he had a passion for sports, they really weren\u2019t that\nimportant. That day, Tebow said he knew it was his \u201cdream and calling to fight\nfor people that can\u2019t fight for themselves.\u201dToday, in addition to\nplaying minor league baseball for the New York Mets, Tebow is a college\nfootball analyst for ESPN, a bestselling author, motivational speaker and philanthropist.FacebookXGoogle+PinterestLinkedInYou may also like\n\n \nArchdiocese \u2022 LocalBible study offers women the chance to grow in their...\n\n \nLocal \u2022 SchoolsBishop Ward kicks off $7.5 million campaign\n\n \nLocal \u2022 Youth & young adultArchbishop\u2019s Invitational honors young student artists...\n\n \nLocal \u2022 Youth & young adultMissionaries needed for summer Totus Tuus program\n\n \nLocal \u2022 Spanish ArticlesLa familia y sus miembros descubren c\u00f3mo les llama el...\n\n \nLent \u2022 LocalDevotion built on desire to follow Christ\u2019s final...About the author\nMarc & Julie AndersonFreelancers Marc and Julie Anderson are long-time contributors to the Leaven.
