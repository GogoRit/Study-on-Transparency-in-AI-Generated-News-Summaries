However, that is beyond the point. Regardless of her intentions, this is a breach of her fundamental human rights and EU rights that Malta has subscribed to.\u201d\nThe warrant, which, prohibits her from travelling breaches her right to freedom of movement and privacy, according to the foundation.\nIn a Facebook post, WRF\u00a0added that this was blatant gender discrimination.\n\nThe woman, who has other children, left the relationship because of domestic abuse, Dimitrijevic told Times of Malta.\u00a0\nShe said the woman was further subjected to degrading treatment as she had to hand over her passport to immigration officers.\nMalta's has among the strictest abortion laws in the world and remains\u00a0the only country in the EU that bans abortion in all circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up to our free newsletters\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\nGet the best updates straight to your inbox:\n\n\n\nDaily newsletter (the day\u2019s top headlines, sent every\nmorning)\n\n\n\nFrom the editors (a curated selection of stories, sent\nevery Saturday)\n\n\nPlease select at least one mailing list.\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.
