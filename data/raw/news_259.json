That can\u2019t possibly meet the needs of the roughly 10,000 women who seek abortion services in Louisiana each year, they\u00a0told\u00a0the Supreme Court.\nThe state law, critics warn, is unconstitutional because it offers no benefits to women\u2019s health that could justify the burdens on abortion access.\nPa.\u2019s Shapiro urges U.S. Supreme Court to reject Louisiana abortion restrictions\n\nA coalition of states including Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia is urging the court to strike down Louisiana\u2019s law.

The Louisiana admitting-privileges requirement \u201calso imposes devastating burdens on access to abortion services.\u201d\nAnother group of states argued in a\u00a0brief\u00a0that the high court should reject the appeal because the challengers lack the legal \u201cstanding\u201d to sue. Alternatively, those states urge the Supreme Court to uphold Louisiana\u2019s law.\nIn February, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to temporarily block the law from taking effect. Four conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh \u2014 said they would have denied the request to stay the law.\nIn a dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that he would have allowed the law to take effect because the appeals court had said \u201cthe new law would not affect the availability of abortions from \u2026 the four doctors who currently perform abortions at Louisiana\u2019s three abortion clinics.\u201d\nKennedy was the swing vote on a host of contentious issues, including on the 2016\u00a0decision\u00a0in the case,\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health v.
