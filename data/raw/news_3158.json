Photos by Katie Peterson\nProtecting all life \u201cfrom womb to tomb\u201d was the mantra as 80 youth, seminarians, clergy and adults participated in the\u00a0Diocese of Nashville Office of Faith Formation\u2019s Pro-Life and Human Dignity Pilgrimage Jan. 20-23 in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOur pilgrimage was an amazing experience for our participants. I have heard many great things from many of the teens as well as adult chaperones,\u201d said Shelby Conner, assistant director of youth and young adult ministry for the diocesan Office of Faith Formation. \u201cWe enjoyed seeing the sites of D.C., but, most importantly, allowing teens the opportunity to stand up for the right to life was an experience that I hope they carry with them forever.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Diocese of Nashville marches for lifeMBA students pay respects to late teacher at ArlingtonVanderbilt University alums preparing for life as Dominican friars\u00a0\nThroughout the pilgrimage, participants were encouraged to go through each day reflecting on a saint that represented what being pro-life and respecting human dignity was all about.\u00a0And the first was the man responsible for the celebration all about the youth, \u201cWorld Youth Day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSt. John Paul II\u00a0\nAfter beginning with Mass in the hotel ballroom on Thursday, Jan. 20, Bill Staley, director of new media evangelization for the\u00a0diocese, spoke to the youth about St. John Paul II, who was pope from 1978 until his death in 2005.\u00a0\nThroughout\u00a0his life, he\u00a0encountered many evils and sad\u00a0moments. He witnessed the deaths of his mother, two siblings, and his father throughout his childhood\u00a0and years as a young man. He endured life under the oppression of the Nazis during World War II and the Communists in the years that followed. During his papacy, he watched\u00a0the genocide in Rwanda\u00a0in horror with the rest of the\u00a0world, and\u00a0survived an assassination attempt.\u00a0\nBut St. John Paul II always spoke in defense of the dignity of every human life.\u00a0\n\u201cHe really wanted the pro-life movement to succeed,\u201d Staley said. \u201cHe wrote encyclicals on it, and it was one of the things that really affected his papacy.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The whole point of his papacy is he wanted people to know their worth.\u00a0Even though there are these terrible intrinsic\u00a0evils in the world,\u00a0from Nazis in the 1940s up until abortion in today\u2019s time, he wanted people to know their human value, and that we are made in the image and likeness of our creator.\u201d\u00a0\nWith that, the diocesan delegation set off to\u00a0see and take pictures in front of the\u00a0U.S. Capitol, the Dominican House of Studies, where they learned about the way the Dominican friars pray and learn,\u00a0the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception\u00a0for a self-guided tour, and back to the Capitol for a night tour.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis sign was shown outside the bookstore in the basement of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.\nThe Dominican House of Studies and seeing several religious at the Basilica proved a highlight for McKenna Sullivan, who attends both Holy Family Church in Brentwood and St. Luke Church in Smyrna.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I saw all the different orders (of sisters and brothers), it was beautiful to see,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cSeeing those who choose and seeing\u00a0those who are actively discerning the religious life is really awesome because they\u2019re just so intelligent and well-spoken in the faith, and they\u2019re living out their faith in their best way. And just seeing that really spoke to me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nNoah Burckhard,\u00a0a\u00a0parishioner of Our Lady of the Lake Church in Hendersonville, also enjoyed the Dominican House of Studies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cLearning how the religious\u00a0live their lives and have their prayer and what they do each day, it sounds like a good life,\u201d Burckhard said. \u201cThe Dominicans, they pray from when they get up to when they go to sleep. In between, they\u2019re learning, and it\u2019s given me a deeper understanding for what people do to worship God.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nFor Ashley Saavedra,\u00a0a\u00a0parishioner of Church of the Assumption in the Germantown neighborhood, seeing the Pieta at the Basilica is what brought the day back to St. John Paul II.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSeeing the Pieta in life-size form, that was very touching to see,\u201d Saavedra said. \u201cIt reminded me of the sacrifice John Paul II made with his family. Knowing what he went through and then seeing everything that our Blessed Mother Mary went through, it was that same sort of sacrifice that the saints take after.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSt. Gianna Beretta Molla\u00a0\nAs the group prepared on Friday, Jan. 21, to attend the 49th annual March for Life, Julianne Staley, director of\u00a0faith\u00a0formation at St. Edward Church, talked to them about St. Gianna Beretta Molla, and her personal connection to the 21st century saint.\u00a0\u00a0\nBoth St. Gianna and Staley\u2019s mother, Marianne Staley, experienced complications with their fourth pregnancies and were encouraged to abort the pregnancies, she said. Both refused even though it meant risking their own lives.\u00a0\nDiocesan delegates look out upon the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., the largest Catholic Church in the United States.\n\u201cMy mom chose life and to risk her life to have\u00a0me,\u201d Staley said. \u201cSt. Gianna did the same thing.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nStaley\u2019s mother survived; St. Gianna did not. Her 2004 canonization proves that \u201cwe are all called to be saints,\u201d Staley said, before reminding the students on the pilgrimage that by marching, they could be making a difference. \u201cThe March for Life is the only march where you\u2019re marching for others. We\u2019re marching for those babies who don\u2019t have a voice for themselves.\u201d \u00a0\nThose thoughts were ones that resonated with several of the students.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m also my mom\u2019s fourth child and that idea that a pro-life stance can affect so many people so greatly is powerful,\u201d said Carlisle Brown,\u00a0a\u00a0parishioner of Our Lady of the Lake. \u201cIt was such a great sacrifice for St. Gianna to have chosen life, and it was the right decision even though it led to her death.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSt. Gianna is a role model to me of what I want to be when I\u2019m a mother because she sacrificed her life for her baby,\u201d added Madeline Kopf, a parishioner of St. Philip Church in Franklin.\u00a0\u00a0\nSt. Maximilian Kolbe\u00a0\nDay three of the pilgrimage began with the story of St. Maximilian Kolbe, a Franciscan monk who gave his life while imprisoned at Auschwitz Concentration Camp.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it was thought that three prisoners had tried to escape, the Nazis decided to select 10 prisoners to go to the starvation bunker as punishment. When one of the selected expressed concerns for his wife and children, Maximilian Kolbe offered to take his place.\u00a0\u00a0\nDay One of the Diocese of Nashville\u2019s Pro-Life and Human Dignity Pilgrimage consisted of trips to the U.S. Capitol, the Russell Senate Building, the Dominican House of Studies and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.\nSt.\u00a0Maximilian \u201cled the other nine prisoners\u00a0in\u00a0prayer and in singing\u00a0hymns to Mary. Whenever the guards would come and check on prisoners, it was noted that he was always on his knees praying in the middle of them,\u201d explained Father Andy\u00a0Bulso, chaplain of youth and young adult ministry for the\u00a0diocese\u00a0and pastor of St. Edward Church.\u00a0\u00a0\nEventually, eight of the prisoners succumbed to starvation. Then, after two weeks without food,\u00a0in order to\u00a0clear the bunker,\u00a0St.\u00a0Maximilian and the other prisoner were given a lethal injection.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhen Pope John Paul II did his canonization in 1971, two interesting things happened,\u201d Father\u00a0Bulso\u00a0said. \u201cThe man who Maximilian Kolbe gave his life for was present at his canonization. Then, John Paul II walked out in\u00a0the color red, proclaiming Maximilian Kolbe to be a martyr, especially for the circumstances of his death in the concentration camp.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s an example that Father\u00a0Bulso\u00a0encouraged the youth to think about.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cCan you imagine being in that concentration camp with all this cruelty and savagery? What a dark place. It would be so easy to just give up, to lose hope, to despair,\u201d Father\u00a0Bulso\u00a0said. \u201cBut he held on, and he never stopped looking for ways to love, to give his life for others,\u00a0and that\u2019s an amazing example for us.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThat theme of sacrifice was carried throughout the day as the students visited Arlington National Cemetery where they witnessed the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and walked across the Arlington Memorial Bridge toward the National Mall where they visited the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the National World War II Memorial and the Washington Monument.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe day ended with a Vigil Mass in\u00a0the\u00a0Crypt Church beneath the main sanctuary of the Basilica, which was celebrated by Father\u00a0Bulso\u00a0and\u00a0Father Andrew Forsythe, pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Lawrenceburg.\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring his homily, Father\u00a0Bulso\u00a0emphasized the importance of \u201crejoicing in the Lord must be your strength,\u201d as he spoke about the March for Life and the message behind it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThere is a particular joy about the march because it is ultimately our faith that draws us here. We ourselves live \u2026 in the in-between times. What I mean is this. The Messiah has come. \u2026\u00a0He has died for us. He is risen. He has opened for us the way to eternal life. He has established the\u00a0Church,\u201d Father\u00a0Bulso\u00a0said. \u201cBut we are in the in-between time. He will come again. There is a fulfillment that has not yet taken place; a fulfillment that will happen at his second coming. We are in the already and not yet \u2026\u00a0and rejoicing in the Lord must be our strength.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOne thing that will help you stay connected to the source of our joy, something that will help our own conversion of heart that we might then lead the world to a conversion of the heart: rejoicing in the Lord must be our strength,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how can we not rejoice when our Lord is present here, giving himself to us in the Holy Eucharist, his very body and blood to strengthen us, to sustain us in this pilgrimage, this in between time as we await the fulfillment of his kingdom and the full establishment of the Gospel of Life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSt. Edith Stein\u00a0\nThe final day of the pilgrimage, Sunday, Jan. 23, focused on Carmelite sister St. Edith Stein. Like\u00a0St.\u00a0Maximilian Kolbe, St. Edith was a martyr during the Holocaust, which is why Michaela Miller, youth minister for St. Philip Church in Franklin, said she chose her as her Confirmation saint.\u00a0\nMiller\u00a0enjoyed studying World War II, but\u00a0her connection to St. Edith Stein became more prevalent throughout her life.\u00a0\u00a0\nSt. Edith Stein was \u201cknown for her writings on women\u2019s roles in the\u00a0Church, and here I am working as a youth minister, so I feel sure that is not a coincidence,\u201d Miller said, as she spoke with the youth. \u201cKnow that your Confirmation saint chose you for a reason and has been interceding for you, so continue to pray to them and ask for their intercession.\u00a0\nShelby Conner, assistant director of youth and young adult ministry for the diocesan Office of Faith Formation, prays before the Pieta at St. Patrick Church.\n\u201cSt. Pope John Paul II is known for writing Theology of the Body, which is really a doctrine about how we are made in the image and likeness of God,\u201d she continued. \u201cEdith Stein aligned herself with that\u201d as shown in her doctoral thesis on empathy, which had many similarities.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the itinerary for the day included trips to Ford\u2019s Theater, St. Patrick Church, the oldest church in Washington, and the National Portrait Gallery, that connection circled back around at their final stop at the St. John Paul II National Shrine. There, after taking a moment to pray in front of a relic of St. John Paul in Luminous Mysteries Chapel, the group prayed the Divine Mercy Chaplet together as the pilgrimage came to an end.\u00a0\u00a0\nGrowing in faith\u00a0\nWhen all was said and done, the youth reflected on how the trip helped them grow in their faith.\u00a0\u00a0\nThomas Schiermeier, a parishioner of Our Lady of the Lake, noted how wonderful it was to see\u00a0people from\u00a0so many churches\u00a0in\u00a0the diocese come together \u201cfighting for one cause.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt helped me figure out that the\u00a0Church really is one person and one body in Christ,\u201d Schiermeier said. \u201cIf we all have the same mindset, we can try to make a difference.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAbigail Aud, a parishioner of St. Stephen Catholic Community, said meeting and being around the other youth stood out to her, particularly Saavedra, who would wear a veil while praying or attending Mass.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve known about (wearing veils) but it was really cool to get to see someone who is actually really into them and just seeing how deeply she connects with her faith,\u201d Aud said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her praying a lot, and it really lit a fire in me. I want to be like that. I want to be a little more prayerful, and it was just really nice to see that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSullivan said the pilgrimage helped her realize how much she loves prayer and spending more time with Jesus.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that my faith is a big part of who I am. I know it\u2019s going to be hard going back to school and being around people who disagree with me or who aren\u2019t Catholic, but I realize that I have to take that faith back home with me even when the world is telling me not to,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cYou still live out your faith regardless \u2026 and approach all situations with love.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPreviousVanderbilt University alums preparing for life as Dominican friars\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nNextFather Subb leaves Holy Family Church, heads toward retirement\u00a0Next \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our email list\nKeep your finger on the pulse of Catholic life in Middle Tennessee by subscribing to the weekday\nE-Register here.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSt. Mary\u2019s Bookstore a stop on Fontanini Tour\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 27, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNashvilleCatholic.org: a robust choir\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 20, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAquinas College alumnus Col.
