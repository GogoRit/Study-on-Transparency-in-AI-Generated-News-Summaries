Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMartha Plimpton never thought she was cool. Not when she fought off villains in The Goonies, or wore plaid and dirty Converse before Kurt Cobain did, or went to the Oscars with an inch of hair and River Phoenix on her arm. But she\u2019s grateful if anyone ever got that impression. \u201cIt makes me happy to know that all those years I thought I looked like a frump, something was working,\u201d she jokes in her New York drawl, while chewing on a roll-up she won\u2019t light for a while. She\u2019s Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart: her jagged glamour, his mouth.It\u2019s an overcast day in October, and Plimpton is reclining in a glitter bomb jumpsuit at one end of a hotel conference room. Her hair is cut into red waves, with a slick of blonde straight up the middle. It\u2019s for a role, says the 51-year-old, who thinks of herself as a \u201chair actor\u201d. She says she gets lost if it\u2019s not quite right. For The Goonies\u2019 no-nonsense Stef, it was cut into a shaggy bob, the kind made for adolescents who like to roll their eyes. As the rebellious teen dating Keanu Reeves in Ron Howard\u2019s Parenthood, her hair was as long, blonde and pliable as a doll\u2019s. For her new film Mass, she\u2019s a grieving mother with a haircut reflective of her pain. It\u2019s functional, efficient, fine. Bigger things are on her mind.If awards season wasn\u2019t so distracted by middling celebrity biopics, Mass would have been \u2013 and absolutely should have been \u2013 a major Oscar player. It stars Plimpton, Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd and Reed Birney as two sets of parents (Gail and Jay and Linda and Richard, respectively) linked by a high school shooting. They\u2019ve arranged to meet for the first time in the basement of a church and at the encouragement of a therapist. As the couples share uncomfortable small talk and simmer with guilt and fury, the context becomes clear: Linda and Richard\u2019s son was responsible for the shooting, and Gail and Jay\u2019s son was caught up in it. Both boys are now dead. It is a wrenching, difficult but ultimately life-affirming drama, one that dares to rest in a deeply uncomfortable space.Plimpton found the script \u2013 by actor and first-time filmmaker Fran Kranz \u2013 impossible to put down. Kranz had become a father shortly before the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018. The Parkland, Florida massacre left 17 people dead and should have been, but depressingly wasn\u2019t, a bellwether on gun control. Kranz asked himself whether he, as a parent, could ever forgive the parents of the person responsible. \u201cHe was overcome with questions,\u201d Plimpton explains. \u201cAnd even though we live in this horrible cultural place where we seem to always have these f***ing shootings, he didn\u2019t set out to write a polemic. He wrote a story asking how we move forward and how we get out of this. And it is possible. It can be done.\u201dAll four actors are at the peak of their superpowers, but I kept fixed on Plimpton. Gail burns with anger and quiet repulsion. She seems to despise her natural empathy at first, as if it makes her weak or disrespectful to the son she lost, but then it releases like a tidal wave. I seemed to follow Gail\u2019s lead. At firstI villainised Richard and Linda, judging the showiness of their grief, but then later on I felt terrible about it. Plimpton understands that impulse.RecommendedThe Goonies: Inside the 1980s treasure hunt adventure whose cult appeal will never dieStand by me: The cinematic legacy of River PhoenixPeter Dinklage: \u2018I would like to see some sort of gremlin get in the internet and shut the whole thing down\u2019\u201cIn our world right now, we don\u2019t see everyone\u2019s basic humanity,\u201d she says. \u201cThe film demonstrates that we can stop having the Fox News or CNN version of the conversation. It\u2019s done. We\u2019ve covered that. What\u2019s not been covered is: who are you? Who am I?\u201d It\u2019s easier said than done though, surely? She holds her hands up. \u201cHey, man, it\u2019s difficult for me, too. We\u2019re only human, and these things are designed to gin us up. That\u2019s the reason these TV networks exist \u2013 they\u2019re designed to polarise us. And if we\u2019re polarised and divided, we\u2019re much more easy to manipulate.\u201dJason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton in \u2018Mass' (Sky)That media ethos is one of the reasons she lives in London for much of the year now, even if she\u2019s quick to clarify that she knows the UK isn\u2019t much better politically. But, as an outsider, she can at least be distracted by very British pleasures: the less \u201cself-serious\u201d theatre scene; the shopkeeper on the corner who calls her \u201clove\u201d when she buys something; \u201cgetting a roast dinner at three o\u2019clock on Sunday afternoon\u201d.In person, Plimpton shares the same forthright strength as her best characters, mixed with that underlying vulnerability. On screen, it\u2019s kinetic: an enviable sense of total self-belief and beyond-her-years wisdom. The daughter of actors Shelley Plimpton and Keith Carradine, she found work as a child model and then an actor in the early Eighties, often playing smart alecs and tomboys. Art tended to imitate life. Plimpton\u2019s life-long friend Ethan Hawke once remarked that she\u2019s incapable of \u201cbuying any bulls***\u201d. \u201cI guess it\u2019s the New Yorker in me,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up in a city where you could walk and ride the bus and the subway with all kinds of people. It makes you less self-focused and more pragmatic.\u201d Could she be intimidating as a teenager? \u201cOnly to misogynists. If people were ever intimidated by me, it was because of something they needed to work on in themselves.\u201dIn 20 years I\u2019ll probably read this interview and go, \u2018F***, I sound like an asshole!\u2019A lot of those people did hold power back then, though. In early interviews, Plimpton would always vent about the state of the film industry. \u201cI\u2019m in a period of being extremely discouraged with the business and the lack of interesting roles for young women,\u201d she said in 1988. \u201cIt\u2019s completely chauvinistic.\u201d When I remind Plimpton of this quote, she erupts in a cackle. \u201cJesus, I\u2019ve been saying that for 40 years? F***ing hell, get a new line, lady!\u201d When I tell her she was just 17 when she said that, she seems relieved. \u201cOK, so not quite 40 years, thank God.

Plan auto-renews until cancelledTry for freeShe says she agrees with the sentiments of her younger self, but doesn\u2019t remember that era wearing her down. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a teenager or in your twenties, you think you know everything so you become a little bit of a dick,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the ingenue back then and it might have pissed me off \u2013 but then I grew up.\u201d If anything, she finds the Martha Plimpton of 1988 a lot more frustrating than that era\u2019s film industry. \u201cYou should definitely not ask anyone famous and under the age of 35 their opinion on f***ing anything. I read those interviews and I\u2019m just like, \u2018God, Martha \u2013 you sound like such a gas bag!\u2019\u201d She turns her eyes on me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change, though. In 20 years I\u2019ll probably read this interview and go, \u2018F***, I sound like an asshole!\u2019\u201dPlimpton (far right) in the classic Eighties adventure film \u2018The Goonies' (Warner Bros/Kobal/Shutterstock)Hollywood was a long time ago. It was before she\u2019d more or less quit filmmaking for Chicago\u2019s famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company in the early Nineties, before her three Tony Award nominations and then her resurgence on television. She\u2019s had a decade-plus run of playing flamboyant supporting characters in great TV: The Good Wife, for which she won an Emmy; the ramshackle family sitcom Raising Hope; Lena Dunham\u2019s short-lived teen drama Generation. But everyone still wants to talk about what she was working on and who she was dating when she was a teenager.She makes it a rule not to talk about Phoenix, and publicly hasn\u2019t since a year after his death of a drug overdose in 1993 \u2013 they\u2019d dated from 1986 to 1989. But that same caution also seems to extend to the films they made together: the paranoid thriller The Mosquito Coast, and the gorgeous Running on Empty, starring Phoenix as the child of counter-culture fugitives, and Plimpton as the girl with whom he wants to run away. She shares positive if oblique memories of that time. \u201cI made some really fun movies with some really cool people who were really lovely and really taught me a lot,\u201d she says. She grins, and says she needs a cigarette. Strutting across the room, she cracks open a window, wedges herself in its alcove, and lights up.Martha Plimpton and River Phoenix in a publicity still for \u2018Running on Empty\u2019 in 1988 (Warner Bros/Kobal/Shutterstock)I ask what happens when you\u2019re an impressionable 19-year-old still figuring out your place in the world, and then Jane Fonda plays your mother in a film \u2013 as she did in 1990\u2019s Stanley & Iris. \u201cIt helps,\u201d Plimpton deadpans. \u201cI really, really love her. I love that she\u2019s honest and that she\u2019s trying, and that she hasn\u2019t given up on her ideals about the kind of world she wants us all to live in. One of equality and justice and fairness.\u201d Fonda and Plimpton share similarities \u2013 they\u2019re women who\u2019ve always balanced acting with activism, who\u2019ve never drawn a line under their political education. For Plimpton, her primary cause is reproductive health.\u201cI care about the fact that my rights as a woman aren\u2019t respected,\u201d she explains, her voice crisp and measured. \u201cAnd that women all over the world, but particularly poor women and women of colour, are even less respected. It makes me angry. I don\u2019t want to live in a world where women aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d A few years ago, the Daily Mail expressed faux outrage over Plimpton\u2019s presence at a pro-choice rally in Seattle, in which she joked that she had her \u201cbest abortion\u201d in the city. She finds tip-toeing around the subject ludicrous.\u201cI don\u2019t think abortion is weird or abnormal or something that \u2018bad people\u2019 do. Abortion is healthcare, and very basic and essential health care. And while it\u2019s not just a woman\u2019s issue \u2013 clearly, it\u2019s also an issue for many trans men and many non-binary people \u2013 the roots of the stigma around it is misogyny. I\u2019m sick of it. It deserves to be understood and respected and not framed in this very binary way: good and bad. And there\u2019s no such thing to me as \u2018pro-life\u2019, you know? We\u2019re all f***ing pro-life!\u201dA publicist arrives and asks us to wrap up. \u201cLet me just take a breath and calm down,\u201d Plimpton sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just very important to me, and I\u2019ll be dedicated to it for as long as we have to do this bulls***.\u201d She shakes her head, takes one last drag of her cigarette and tosses it out the window. Dusting the ash from her jumpsuit, she says her goodbyes and disappears in a sparkly flash down a corridor. In the Eighties, today and forever, she\u2019s the kind of cool you want to be when you grow up.Sky Original film \u2018Mass\u2019 is coming to Sky Cinema and cinemas nationwide on Thursday 20 JanuaryMore aboutMartha PlimptonRiver PhoenixJason IsaacsAnn DowdJane FondaThe Saturday InterviewJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/4Martha Plimpton: \u2018I was only intimidating to misogynists\u2019Martha Plimpton: \u2018I was only intimidating to misogynists\u2019Jason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton in \u2018Mass'SkyMartha Plimpton: \u2018I was only intimidating to misogynists\u2019Plimpton (far right) in the classic Eighties adventure film \u2018The Goonies'Warner Bros/Kobal/ShutterstockMartha Plimpton: \u2018I was only intimidating to misogynists\u2019Martha Plimpton and River Phoenix in a publicity still for \u2018Running on Empty\u2019 in 1988Warner Bros/Kobal/ShutterstockMartha Plimpton: \u2018I was only intimidating to misogynists\u2019Martha Plimpton: \u2018You should not ask anyone famous and under 35 their opinion on f***ing anything\u2019Amy Sussman/Getty Images\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
