and Kyle Long received the worst news of their life, an Ohio law made their searing pain even worse.  \n    \n\n            For four years, the Longs tried to have a baby, enduring multiple rounds of grueling fertility treatments. In September 2022, Beth finally became pregnant.  \n    \n\n            But an ultrasound four months later showed that most of the baby\u2019s organs were outside the body.  \n    \n\n            The condition, called limb body wall complex, is rare.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s just not survivable,\u201d a doctor involved in Beth\u2019s care told CNN.\n    \n\n            \u201cThey will die. There\u2019s no way there will be a life,\u201d said Dr. Alireza Shamshirsaz, a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, who was not involved in Beth\u2019s care.  \n    \n\n            The condition posed dangers for Beth too, and the bigger the baby was, the higher the risk of complications, including dangerous bleeding that might require a hysterectomy. They say their doctor  urged them to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe condition Beth Long's baby had, limb body wall complex, is rare.

She\u2019s employed by the state of Ohio, and state law bans her health insurance from paying for abortions except in certain cases. \n    \n\n            Endangerment to the life of the mother is one of them, and although she was at an increased risk for potentially deadly complications, Beth\u2019s life was not in imminent danger, and the Longs say their doctor told them the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the procedure.  \n    \n\n            Beth and Kyle would have to foot the bill: between $20,000 and $30,000. After spending $45,000 on fertility treatments, they didn\u2019t have the money.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas woman almost dies because she couldn't get an abortion  \n\n\n\n\n             It took them three weeks to make arrangements to go to a hospital that could perform the complicated abortion at a lower price. It was hours away, in another state. \n    \n\n            During that three-week wait \u2013 a wait they had to endure only because of the Ohio law \u2013 the risk to Beth of potentially deadly complications grew. Their ability to try to have another baby was delayed, and their \u201cagony\u201d couldn\u2019t end, Beth said.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI was in mental anguish,\u201d Beth said.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt felt very inhumane for both our baby and for my wife,\u201d Kyle added.  \n    \n\n            The hospital they found was a three-hour drive away, in Pittsburgh. Away from their regular obstetrician, whom Beth had known for years; away from their doula; away from their friends and family. The Longs were alone.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Long and Beth Boring in February 2018, shortly after their engagement.\n\nRachel Joy Barehl\n\n\n\n    \u2018The Long and Boring wedding\u2019\n\n\n            Beth Boring and Kyle Long met on a dating app in 2015. Their first date was a storytelling event at a local arts organization.  \n    \n\n            Beth, who was 26 at the time, had been a teacher for special-needs children and was about to start nursing school.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI loved her big heart,\u201d Kyle says.  \n    \n\n            Kyle, then 30 and a wedding photographer, told Beth he\u2019d bring her food when she started school. \u201d \u2018I\u2019ll bring you fries and dinner while you study and I won\u2019t bother you at all,\u2019 \u201d she remembers him telling her. \n    \n\n            \u201cHe was so sweet and made a big effort to love everyone in my life, and that was important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cKyle made me feel completely safe and respected.\u201d  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOULDER, CO - JANUARY 31, 2022: Dr Warren Hern organizes his tools inside his  clinic on January 31, 2022 in Boulder, Colorado.

She was stressed from studying for nursing school exams, with books and papers strewn around the room.   \n    \n\n            \u201cShe said that if I could love in the cycle of life she was in, [then] we should be able to make it through anything,\u201d Kyle recalls.  \n    \n\n            Directly after the proposal, Beth and Kyle went to Christmas Eve services at Central Vineyard Church in Columbus and shared the exciting news with family and friends, jokingly inviting them to the \u201cLong and Boring wedding,\u201d which took place at the church in June.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle and Beth Long tried to start a family soon after their wedding in 2018.\n\nRachel Joy Barehl\n\n\n\n             Beth was now 29. They tried to start a family soon after, but after a year of trying, a doctor discovered that Beth had advanced endometriosis, and she had surgery in February 2020.  \n    \n\n            They then spent $15,000 on a round of fertility treatments that didn\u2019t yield any viable embryos. A second round, at the same price, had the same result.  \n    \n\n            The process was grueling. Beth had to give herself shots of hormones, and for some of the treatments, they had to do a four-hour round-trip drive to the Cleveland Clinic. Between each round, they had to wait months to try again, with even more delays as doctors\u2019 appointments often had to be canceled and rescheduled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  \n    \n\n            Finally, a third round yielded three viable embryos: two boys and a girl.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI just had a gut feeling we were supposed to transfer the girl\u201d to her uterus, Beth said.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTara and Justin George speak with CNN about her pregnancy.

She\u2019s always been Star to us,\u201d Beth said.  \n    \n\n            They waited seven weeks to see whether the implantation had worked.  \n    \n\n            \u201cThey did an ultrasound, and they confirmed her heartbeat,\u201d Beth remembers. \u201cThe tech said it was perfect. Perfect heartbeat.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019d finally made it to pregnancy,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cWe\u2019d spent years working on this, thousands of miles, thousands of dollars trying to get here, and it finally felt like it was worth it.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Another ultrasound in December, when Beth was 16 weeks pregnant, also looked good, and they shared the happy news with their families at Christmas.  \n    \n\n            At that 16-week visit, Beth also had blood taken for routine tests.  \n    \n\n            They didn\u2019t think much about that blood work until they received a phone call just after the new year.  \n    \n\n    \u2018Incompatible with life\u2019\n\n\n             On January 4, the day before Beth\u2019s 34th birthday, she received a call from her obstetrician.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI could tell it was her serious voice,\u201d Beth remembers. \u201cShe said, \u2018Some of your lab work came back abnormal.\u2019 \u201d  \n    \n\n            The doctor explained that the baby might have a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida. \n    \n\n            Kyle started keeping a journal that day. \u201cWe are prepared to raise a child with any disabilities,\u201d he wrote.  \n    \n\n            The next day, Beth\u2019s birthday, \u201cwe meet with the genetic counselor, and she reassures us that she has seen a lot of fluke results and not to worry,\u201d Kyle wrote.  \n    \n\n            And even if it wasn\u2019t a fluke, \u201cmost potential issues seemed small. If there was a large issue, it could likely be fixed with surgery. It would require us to potentially temporarily move to a new city, but we both feel optimistic going into the scan,\u201d Kyle wrote.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas\n\n\n\n\n            Still, \u201cthe scan felt like the longest 15 minutes of our life,\u201d he wrote.  \n    \n\n            The ultrasound technician left the room and returned with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, the genetic counselor and a nurse.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe knew something was wrong,\u201d Kyle wrote.  \n    \n\n            The doctor explained how the baby hadn\u2019t developed a lower spine and the rib cage was large enough to hold only her heart, which was beating.  \n    \n\n            \u201cThere were organs outside her body. Her heart was inside her body, but it was abnormal,\u201d said the physician involved with Beth\u2019s care. \u201cThis is not compatible with survival.\u201d  \n    \n\n            The doctor asked not to be named because the hospital where they work has not given them permission to speak to the media.  \n    \n\n            The Longs remember their doctors repeatedly using the phrase \u201cincompatible with life\u201d as they explained that the baby would probably die inside Beth or during birth.  \n    \n\n            At the ultrasound, the doctor \u201cnamed a few more wrong things, but at that point I was more focused on Beth. At that moment we realized we were never going to have [our] baby girl,\u201d Kyle wrote in the journal.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe would have done anything to make her better,\u201d Kyle said. But \u201cthere\u2019s no surgery, there\u2019s no magic pill that we could have done to make things better.\u201d  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarlena Stell\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some states, doctors weigh 'ruinous' litigation against proper care for women who have miscarriages \n\n\n\n\n            The doctors assured the Longs that they\u2019d done nothing wrong; Star\u2019s rare condition was just by chance.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019re really good at winning the bad lottery,\u201d Beth said.  \n    \n\n            The next day, the Longs met with Beth\u2019s obstetrician. They said she explained that Star\u2019s organs, besides her heart, had spilled out of a hole in her abdomen and were enmeshed in the placenta.  \n    \n\n            \u201c[The doctor] explains to us that the sooner the pregnancy is ended the better it will be for Beth\u2019s health. The longer the baby grows with these abnormalities, it will continue to have a worse and worse impact on Beth\u2019s health,\u201d Kyle wrote in his journal.  \n    \n\n            Beth said that if the placenta tore during the procedure, \u201cI could have a lot of internal bleeding\u201d because the bigger Star grew, \u201cthe more complicated and enmeshed [the placenta] was going to be, so time was of the essence.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Shamshirsaz, director of the Maternal Fetal Care Center at Boston Children\u2019s Center and a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, noted that a 21-week fetus is significantly larger than a 17-week fetus, so the three-week wait put Beth at a higher risk for bleeding and other complications.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe know in obstetrics if we can do [an] earlier termination, the outcomes will be better. That is set in stone,\u201d he said.  \n    \n\n            Dr. Erika Werner is the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of patients who never thought they would consider termination that have ended up terminating because of this diagnosis,\u201d said Werner, who was not involved in Beth\u2019s care.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Capitol dome is seen early Wednesday morning before Amb.

She would reach out to one of the few specialists in Columbus who could do the complicated and risky procedure.  \n    \n\n            Over the next few days, the couple grieved for their lost baby daughter. As Kyle photographed a wedding, he watched little girls dancing with their dads during the father/daughter song, and he knew he\u2019d never have that chance with Star.  \n    \n\n            They gave their baby a full name: Cordelia Poppy Star Long, with Star as a nickname because that\u2019s what she looked like at the implantation and Corn Pop \u201cbecause it was cute,\u201d Kyle wrote in his journal.  \n    \n\n            While they waited to hear back from the obstetrician, Kyle called a local funeral home to arrange for Star\u2019s cremation while Beth knit and crocheted tiny dresses for Star.   \n    \n\n            On January 9, three days after their appointment with the obstetrician, the Longs signed a form so they could officially begin Ohio\u2019s 24-hour waiting period before an abortion.  \n    \n\n            The termination was supposed to take place in the next day or two, and while they dreaded it, they hoped it would mark the beginning of a recovery period, and then they try as soon as possible to implant one of their other two viable embryos.  \n    \n\n            But that didn\u2019t happen.  \n    \n\n            Kyle wrote this in his journal: \u201cTuesday, 1/10 \u2013 The doctor calls and lets us know that none of it will be covered by insurance.\u201d  \n    \n\n    \u2018It was horrifying\u2019\n\n\n            The doctor explained that while it was legal for them to have the abortion, a 1998 Ohio law made it illegal for state employees\u2019 insurance to cover the procedure except in certain narrow cases. The mother\u2019s life being \u201cendangered if the fetus were carried to term\u201d is one of them, but the law doesn\u2019t define what \u201cendangered\u201d means.  \n    \n\n            In his journal, Kyle wrote that the doctors gave them four options: One, pay the $20,000 to $30,000 and have the abortion right away in Ohio with the specialist their obstetrician had selected; two, wait until the baby died inside Beth, and then insurance would cover the abortion; three, wait until Beth\u2019s life was at sufficient risk that the insurance would cover it; or four, find someplace else where they could do the procedure for less money.  \n    \n\n            \u201cKyle was ready to whip out a credit card\u201d and pay for the procedure to be done soon at the hospital they were already familiar with in Ohio, Beth said.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMifepristone (Mifeprex) and Misoprostol, the two drugs used in a medication abortion, are seen at the Women's Reproductive Clinic, which provides legal medication abortion services, in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, on June 17, 2022.

She\u2019d already taken unpaid time off work during her pregnancy, and she was about to miss more work. \n    \n\n            \u201cFor Beth it made more sense to put the focus on our future children,\u201d Kyle wrote.  \n    \n\n            They decided to try the last option: finding a qualified doctor who would do the procedure for less money.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt was horrifying because we were experiencing the hardest pain that anybody could have, and on top of that, of our grieving, we\u2019re having to handle all of this ourselves and coordinate all of this ourselves,\u201d Kyle said.  \n    \n\n    A race against the clock\n\n\n            Beth was now nearly 19 weeks pregnant. She and Kyle were racing against the clock.  \n    \n\nOhio law allows for abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Plus, with each passing day, the baby was growing larger, putting Beth at increasing risk of potentially deadly complications when it came time for the termination.  \n    \n\n            To spare Beth more anguish, Kyle made calls to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and various hospitals in the state. He wanted to be as close to home as possible so they could be near friends and family for support and so Beth wouldn\u2019t have to endure traveling and staying at a hotel.  \n    \n\n            When he failed to find a place for Beth to have the procedure, he was once again resigned to putting it on his credit card.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion demonstrators march toward the U.S. Supreme Court during the March for Life, Friday, Jan. 20, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nAlex Brandon/AP\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans are now splintering over abortion rights\n\n\n\n\n            But then he received a call back from Leah Mallinos, a social worker and patient navigator at Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. She said UPMC Magee Women\u2019s Hospital in Pittsburgh would do the procedure for $2,500.  \n    \n\n            But it couldn\u2019t happen immediately. There needed to be a virtual appointment with a Magee doctor and a transfer of medical records, and they needed to wait for availability at Magee.  \n    \n\n            While they waited, they grieved the loss of their daughter.  \n    \n\n            Beth bought a fetal Doppler to listen to Star\u2019s heartbeat. She listened to it over and over.  \n    \n\n            \u201cShe had a good, strong heart. I was so proud of that heartbeat,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had worked really, really hard to grow.\u201d  \n    \n\n            On Instagram, Beth posted a video of the Doppler on her belly, recording Star\u2019s heartbeat.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI love her,\u201d she wrote in the post. \u201cAnd I refuse to let her suffer or be in pain for even a moment when she\u2019s on the outside of me. Abortion is the most loving thing I can do for her as her mother, even if it shatters my heart.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Beth prepared for her daughter\u2019s death.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to forget the feeling of my baby girl kicking inside of me while I was looking for urns on the Internet for her ashes,\u201d Beth said.  \n    \n\n            Still, she would have to wait another two weeks before she could have the abortion in Pittsburgh.  \n    \n\n            On January 23, she and Kyle made the drive, bringing with them for comfort Mr. Darcy, Beth\u2019s dog of 11 years, and the dresses that Beth had made for Star.  \n    \n\n            The next day, they signed papers for Pennsylvania\u2019s 24-hour waiting period.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Longs brought baby dresses Beth had knit to her procedure.\n\nKyle and Elizabeth Long\n\n\n\n            Because Beth was so far along in her pregnancy \u2013 by this time, she was 21 weeks \u2013 it was a two-day procedure.  \n    \n\n            On January 26, the dresses Beth had made lay on her stomach as she was waiting to go into the operating room. Kyle kissed his wife\u2019s head as she cried and then went to her belly to tell his daughter goodbye, that he loved her and that he was sorry he and her mother couldn\u2019t save her life.  \n    \n\n            Heather Bradley, a doula who specializes in helping grieving parents, took close-up pictures of Star\u2019s feet wrapped in one of the dresses Beth had made.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA doula took this picture of Star's feet to help Beth and Kyle remember her. \n\nHeather Burke Bradley/Pittsburgh Bereavement Doulas\n\n\n\n            Bradley, founder of Pittsburgh Bereavement Doulas, said she is usually able to control her emotions even in the saddest of situations, but this one was different.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI felt myself tearing up,\u201d she said. The Longs had made \u201cthe worst decision anyone ever has to make, and then to deal with all the other logistics they had to deal with was just ridiculous.\u201d  \n    \n\n            She said the Longs were \u201changing by a thread\u201d after the procedure as they headed back to Columbus.   \n    \n\n            \u201cThey\u2019re traveling in a car for [three] hours after having an abortion. Things can happen. You should be resting and being monitored, sleeping, letting your body heal. You shouldn\u2019t have to be worrying about where we\u2019re going to stop to eat or the expense.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Planned Parenthood gave the Longs $500 for the hotel and the Abortion Fund of Ohio gave them $1,800 toward the $2,500 hospital charge for the procedure, but the Longs say they paid $1,150 out of pocket, which included the rest of the hospital charge and travel expenses. In  addition, they expect bills from the anesthesiologist and other specialists involved in the procedure.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt was a tough drive. We drove there with our child, and we were driving home without her,\u201d Kyle said.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeth and Kyle said goodbye to their daughter, Cordelia Poppy Star Long.\n\nHeather Burke Bradley/Pittsburgh Bereavement Doulas\n\n\n\n    Reaching out to lawmakers\n\n\n            Kyle has reached out to his elected representatives, including Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Sen. JD Vance, both Republicans.  \n    \n\n            He told them that Ohio law had \u201cturned a difficult situation into something nearly unbearable.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cI am a lifelong Republican, but this has turned me into a one-issue voter for those that support reproductive rights.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m writing you to please reconsider how you approach reproductive rights going forward. There are a lot of unintended consequences for families from these laws, and while I can understand you come from a good place, care should ultimately be left to the parents and their physicians. We loved our baby girl and would have done anything to keep her,\u201d he wrote, adding that Ohio abortion laws \u201cprevent grieving parents from the healthcare they need.\u201d  \n    \n\n            He says he never received a response from either DeWine or Vance.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters who support more abortion restrictions and protestors who upset at the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling removing protections for abortions demonstrate in the lobby of the South Carolina Statehouse on Tuesday, June 28, 2022, in Columbia South Carolina.\n\nJeffrey Collins/AP\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists preparing for 'an absolutely crazy year' in first full statehouse sessions since Supreme Court overturned Roe  \n\n\n\n\n            Spokespeople for DeWine and Vance told CNN that they plan on responding to Kyle\u2019s email. DeWine noted that the law banning state insurance from paying for abortions was enacted before he took office.  \n    \n\n            A spokesperson for Beth\u2019s workplace, which owns the insurance plan, says it will continue to comply with the law while providing exceptional patient care. \n    \n\n            Beth belongs to the Ohio Nurses Association, a union affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers.  \n    \n\n            What happened to Beth is \u201can abomination,\u201d federation President Randi Weingarten said. \u201cThe results of not getting proper and timely care due to egregious systemic roadblocks and financial constraints not only causes bodily harm but trauma that will last a lifetime.\n    \n\n            \u201cReproductive care must be a decision that belongs between a patient and a doctor, not with politicians,\u201d she added.  \n    \n\n    Trying to help others\n\n\n            Nearly two weeks after the abortion, Beth and Kyle are filled with both grief and anger.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe wanted more than anything to have this baby, and the laws in place prevented us from getting the proper health care that we needed,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cIt delayed us being able to lay [Star] to rest and grieve our baby for three weeks.\u201d  \n    \n\n            As soon as Beth\u2019s doctors tell them it\u2019s OK, they plan to implant one of their two remaining embryos in the hopes of starting a new pregnancy.  \n    \n\n            In the meantime, they\u2019re mourning Star and want to help other families who might be in their situation.  \n    \n\n            First, they want them to know that there are resources to help, such as Planned Parenthood and groups like the Abortion Fund of Ohio.  \n    \n\n            Second, they\u2019re reaching out to state legislators who support the \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d that passed the Ohio legislature in 2019. It banned nearly all abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, about the sixth week of pregnancy, but a judge in Cincinnati issued an injunction in October, and now in Ohio abortion is allowed up to 22 weeks.  \n    \n\n            They say they hope their story will help change legislators\u2019 minds.  \n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get

\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy, and something needs to change,\u201d  \n    \n\n            Beth adds that she thinks all women should have the right to an abortion, not just women like her whose babies have fatal abnormalities.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt was the most dehumanizing experience of my life,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s John Bonifield and Nadia
