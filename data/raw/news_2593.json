Wade nearly 50 years ago, has launched a campaign to highlight State Senator Carlucci\u2019s seminal role in the creation of the Independent Democratic Coalition, the IDC, a group of eight elected Democrats in the State Senate who voted as a bloc with Republicans for eight years.Sponsor\nThe lead entity in what has become a coalition of various pro-choice, progressive activists on both sides of the Hudson is ProChoice Voter. On Wednesday, the group launched a barrage of postcards\u2014up to 15,000 to Rockland Democrats, 8,250 robocalls, with more to come, and live calls to as many of 14,785. While the impetus behind the campaign is Westchester-based and includes the Democratic Committees of Dobbs Ferry, Irvington and Tarrytown, it is aimed at Rockland voters, where most analysts see Carlucci\u2019s strength. With the exception of a patch of Westchester around Ossining, the county constitutes Carlucci\u2019s 38th New York State Senate district.\nThe messaging is an indictment of the candidate for \u201cbetraying Democratic principles\u201d and \u201clying to his constituents about his role in the IDC\u201d\u2014specifically his role in blocking pro-choice, pro-feminist and other social justice initiatives like the Dream Act, the Climate and Community Protection Act, school funding, the Fair Pay Act and early voting. Because he abandoned Democrats in Albany, the group argues in its literature, \u201che cannot be trusted to fight for us in Congress.\u201d\nIn its literature, ProChoice Voter does not endorse any of the remaining six candidates. The group\u2019s backers no doubt have their personal preferences but are staying mum for the time being. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to shave off a few thousand votes from Carlucci,\u201d says Catherine Lederer-Plaskett, President of WCLA-Choice Matters. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to sell themselves.\u201d\nThe Carlucci conundrum for the others in this crowded race has always been his perceived dominance of Rockland. Though none of whatever private polling other campaigns have done has been made public, it is widely believed that they show not only his strength west of the Hudson but also a disconnect in voters\u2019 minds between his congressional candidacy and his role in the IDC.\nEven if this new entry into the fight succeeds in planting anti-Carlucci seeds, that leaves voters with six other choices, with little indication at this time which might break out of the pack in the next three weeks. Some party leaders, including the Democratic committees in Irvington and Greenburgh, are advising anyone who has not already voted my mail to hold off for a while to see if a new factor, like the anticipated New York Times endorsement, leads to a breakout. That and big questions about voter turnout, namely compliance with vote-by-mail rules and timing, leave this a very difficult election to predict.\nRead or leave a comment on this story...Sponsor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment & PoliticsTop News\n\nLatimer Delivers Optimistic State of the County Address\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMarch 18, 2024\t\t\t\t\n\nBy Rick Pezzullo--- In what could be his final State of the County Address, Westchester County Executive George Latimer last...\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth NewsLifestyles\n\nHorror Vacui\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMarch 18, 2024\t\t\t\t\n\nHORROR VACUI: The unbearable density of being By\u00a0Krista\u00a0Madsen\u2013 OUTER SPACE I learned this expression \u201chorror vacui\u201d from my friend Andrew...\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrvington NewsSchool News\n\nIrvington High Band Performs Outside Islanders Game\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMarch 18, 2024\t\t\t\t\n\nBy Tom Pedulla--- Let\u2019s get this show on the road!
