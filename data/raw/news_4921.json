Rebecca Blackwell/AP Photo \n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical analyses of abortion vary widely.Depending on what you read, abortion in early America was commonplace, safe, legal and accepted \u2014 or it was dangerous and uncommon.   The abortion history debate was elevated this summer when the United States Supreme Court\u2019s majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization asserted \u201cthe right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d Dobbs overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that had guaranteed abortion rights since 1973.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile legal experts on both sides of the debate have agreed that abortion historically has not been considered a constitutional right, Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s opinion riled up many scholars for a number of reasons \u2014 chief among them his claim of an \u201cunbroken tradition\u201d of criminalizing abortion.History is also top-of-mind in the post-Roe world because of so-called \u201czombie\u201d abortion laws. These are laws that were in place before Roe, then stayed on the books and weren\u2019t enforced after Roe rendered them unconstitutional in 1973. Many states have zombie abortion laws. But most abortion bans were written in recent years in anticipation of Roe being overturned. Wisconsin is one of three states \u2014 along with Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 that is enforcing a pre-Roe ban. Two people wrote to WPR\u2019s WHYsconsin with questions about Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion law and the history of how it came to be in the first place. One person asked, \u201cWhat in our society has changed since 1849? Why did people in Wisconsin (during) those times feel that human life at all stages should be protected by law?\u201dAnother asked, \u201cIs there any record on how that law was enforced prior to Roe v. Wade?\u201dWPR\u2019s \u201cCentral Time\u201d host Rob Ferrett spoke with Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California-Davis School of Law, and Kimberley Reilly, an associate professor of democracy and justice studies, history, and women\u2019s studies at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Rob Ferrett: Wisconsin becomes a state in 1848. The first abortion law passed in 1849. Was this a specific thing, saying, \u201cHey we have to tackle the abortion issue\u201d? Or was this just something that Wisconsin did as it was becoming a state? Kim Reilly: We know that they\u2019re trying to codify the common law, and that\u2019s (a process) that\u2019s also happening in (other) states during the mid-19th century \u2014 there\u2019s an effort by some legal reformers to (codify common law). Common law is judicial decisions. (Reformers at the time were trying to put common law) into state statutes. So I think this is likely a matter of the state sort of putting (the common law) into statute, as Wisconsin is becoming a state.RF: Let\u2019s get to the first question shared with us. Can you talk about the variety of ways people in Wisconsin might\u2019ve thought about abortion in the mid-1800s, when this law came into effect? KR: What we know about the law that was passed in 1849 is that it actually made the killing of a \u201cquick child\u201d an act of manslaughter. What that meant was a child that had undergone quickening \u2014 the fetal movement that a pregnant woman would feel, which takes place usually between the fourth and sixth month of pregnancy. Stretching back from the 13th century all the way through the mid-19th century, the quickening doctrine prevailed in law. It was acceptable to end a pregnancy before quickening was felt.RF: The 1849 law gets revised in 1858. They get rid of the word \u201cquick.\u201d Was this a common change around the country to go from banning abortion after quickening to banning abortion in most cases, regardless of how far along the pregnancy was?Mary Ziegler: It was. There was a movement led by the American Medical Association, AMA, that took issue with this quickening distinction across the country. The AMA was pushing that kind of proposal not just in Wisconsin, but in states across the country. (The AMA) was even pushing it with the President of the United States and Congress. So this was definitely a national transformation, not just a local one. RF: There was a key figure here in Wisconsin connected to the national scene \u2014 William Henry Brisbane, a doctor on the AMA committee that reported on criminal abortion. Can you talk about his influence in the state at the time? KR: We don\u2019t have a complete historical record on Dr. Brisbane. But we know he was a Baptist minister that was born in South Carolina, and he moved to Wisconsin in the 1850s. He became chief clerk of the state Senate in 1857. And he was appointed by the AMA to report back to the organization on efforts to criminalize and suppress abortion. He expressed fears about middle class, and particularly upper class, women seeking abortions and even using birth control. He wrote to a colleague that he wanted to get a law passed that criminalized both birth control and abortion in Wisconsin. It\u2019s likely that he had influence over this 1858 law. RF: Mary, can you talk about the cultural mindset behind the anti-abortion effort, the effort to pass laws in states around the country? MZ: Unsurprisingly, it was complicated. One of the listeners who wrote in (to WHYsconsin) suggested that the people who were trying to criminalize abortion \u2014 the doctors (who were part of the AMA) \u2014 had an investment in the idea that life began at conception. And we have some evidence that they made that argument. That was a significant claim that they made in justification for their attitude. They also made other arguments that would be less familiar to us today. They seemed concerned about the relative birth rates of Catholics and Protestants. They were arguing that across the country, as Catholic immigration increased, that Catholic women were having more children than Protestant women, and this was bad for the country, from a kind of eugenics standpoint. They made arguments about gender \u2014 essentially the idea being that women who were having abortions were betraying their obligations to their husbands to have children and to be wives. They even suggested that this was sort of a professional gatekeeping responsibility, because this was a time when the medical profession as a whole was much more porous, and less regulated than we\u2019re used to today. This idea that only certain kinds of doctors understood when life began, and only certain kinds of doctors had the moral fiber to oppose abortion was one point of differentiation in this very competitive market between doctors, midwives and other kinds of practitioners. There were lots of motives that these activists seemed to have. So if you\u2019re trying to pinpoint, was it really all about fetal life? Or was it really all about eugenics? Or was it really all about gender roles? The answer seems to be yes to all of them. And I think sometimes it\u2019s hard to disentangle whether those things were even related internally. RF: Let\u2019s talk about enforcement of these laws. Our second question is about enforcement of abortion restrictions that existed prior to Roe. MZ: There was a lot of under-enforcement. We know once states began criminalizing abortion earlier in pregnancy, as Wisconsin did (in 1858), prosecution remained pretty unusual, with the exception of cases where a pregnant woman died during the procedure. So even as Wisconsin was joining other states in passing further-reaching abortion bans, there was a pretty big disjuncture between the letter of the law and how people were living their lives. So you had this kind of odd sort of duel mindset that seemed to exist. Because you had lots of states, like Wisconsin, passing abortion laws seemingly eliminating the quickening distinction. And simultaneously, people\u2019s actual experience with abortion \u2014 their willingness to have abortions or perform abortions \u2014 didn\u2019t seem fundamentally different (from before the passage of these laws). In fact, prosecutors were very unlikely to enforce the laws. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s hard to generalize, because there was no single (universal) attitude (toward abortion) I think we can identify. KR: Brisbane wrote in another letter to a colleague that he didn\u2019t actually expect the law to be enforced, but he hoped that it would have a moral influence over people. So I think even he was pragmatic about \u2014 as Professor Ziegler was saying \u2014 the realities of enforcement of this criminalization of abortion laws. RF: It can be tough to untangle this history from the arguments we\u2019re having now in 2022. Is it possible, as we dig into the history, to get a clear picture, given the biases we all bring into it? KR: I think it is possible if we allow that the picture is probably more complicated than any of us would imagine it to be when we come in with our present-day biases. It\u2019s not a conversation of life versus choice in the 19th century. If we can get beyond that and open up to other possibilities, we might get a more accurate picture. MZ: I think it\u2019s important to understand our history, and it\u2019s also important to remember that history isn\u2019t sort of like an input-output machine.When we look at history, we\u2019re going to see messiness and nuance.So while I think it\u2019s important to understand how we got where we are, I think it\u2019s also important to approach history from the standpoint of something that is going to be more complicated than the black-and-white debates we may want to have about a subject like abortion.
