But we weren\u2019t ready to celebrate. We knew this was basically the bare minimum the court could do to protect people\u2019s reproductive freedom\u2014and another potentially dangerous reproductive rights decision was looming.  Birth control was next on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket.In 2020, we are still fighting for basic access to care.Today\u2019s ruling allows virtually any employer or university to choose whether or not they  cover the cost of birth control for their students or employees, deflating the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) requirement that insurance plans cover birth control in full\u2014a benefit that granted coverage to 61.4 million women. It\u2019s striking that this reproductive health issue was decided in the midst of a reckoning with America\u2019s racist past and present. Black and brown people, LGBTQ+ individuals, low-income people, and those who live at the intersections of these identities will be impacted most by SCOTUS\u2019s decision to allow companies and schools to decline contraceptive coverage. These people already face insurmountable barriers to the care they need as they face higher rates of unemployment and extraordinary wage gaps. Although the Pennsylvania Attorney General has vowed to fight in the lower courts, this decision sends a disturbing message: The Court is willing to turn its back on people who need birth control, and religion can be used as an excuse to discriminate.NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER Help Fight for Reproductive RightsNATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER Help Fight for Reproductive RightsDONATE NOWI have worked in civil rights for the better part of my life, and today, I\u2019m reminded that we\u2019re still being offered scraps from our highest court and public officials. Yes, there have been incredible strides in recent years like the ACA, but with each move forward, we meet a wall of resistance attempting to reverse our progress. Here\u2019s the thing that no one\u2014especially women\u2014should take for granted: In 2020, we are still fighting for basic access to care. We\u2019re fighting to make our own decisions about our bodies, lives, and futures.The global pandemic has crystallized how broken many of our systems are. The systems that led to disproportionate rates of infection and death among Black and Latinx people. The systems that meant workers deemed essential perform their low-wage jobs without protection. The systems that have women and girls unequally carrying the load of caregiving. The systems of policing that cut Black lives and futures short. Our never-ending battle for essential reproductive health care is yet another racist, sexist pattern that must be changed forever. With an unprecedented awareness of what is broken comes an unprecedented opportunity for change. Related StoryHow Birth Control Could Become the Ultimate Luxury The decisions from this term on contraception and abortion have left the door open for additional legal fights, but the social uprising over the past few months reminds us that change doesn\u2019t only happen in the courts. We can all play a role in the streets, in our living room conversations, and in our local governments to ensure these attacks end for good.This moment is calling on all of us to do more. It\u2019s time that our government and leaders realize that we deserve to live and thrive. We deserve for our families to be safe. We deserve to make our own decisions about our health care. Until politicians stop making those decisions for us, organizations, including my own, will be fighting for a world free from barriers, discrimination, and stigma.Related StoryThe Truth About SCOTUS\u2019s Abortion Case RulingWe need your support by contacting your lawmakers in favor of the Woman\u2019s Health Protection Act and the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act (EACH).
