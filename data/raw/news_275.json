of a ban issued Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas say they have canceled 261 abortions since Tuesday, after the state effectively banned the procedure.Sarah Wheat, the chief external affairs officer for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas in Austin, said the health centers have also been prevented from helping patients seeking abortions.\u201cOur health centers have received 583 calls from patients seeking appointments during that same time period,\u201d she said in a statement.On Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott issued on order halting\u00a0procedures that are \u201cnot immediately medically necessary\u201d\u00a0during the coronavirus outbreak. The next day, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton confirmed that included abortions. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult,\u201d said Dr. Amna Dermish, the regional medical director for Central Texas with Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.\n\n\n\"We have had to rotate staff through that job [of calling patients] because it's a really difficult thing to do.\"\n\n\n\n\nDermish said clinic staff have been forced to call women to let them know their appointments had been canceled indefinitely. She said patients have responded with \u201canger, sadness, frustration and despair\u201d when they\u2019ve gotten that call.\u201cWe have had to rotate staff through that job because it\u2019s a really difficult thing to do,\u201d Dermish said.These cancellations are also coming at a particularly hard time for many patients, Planned Parenthood officials say. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused an unprecedented spike in unemployment claims, as joblessness rates increase across the country.\u201cOur patients are just like everyone else out there,\u201d Dermish said. \u201cThey are dealing with job losses, health insurance losses, concerns about their health and their welfare.\u201dShe said \u201cadding an unintended pregnancy\u201d and taking away the option of having an abortion has been hard for her patients to deal with.\u201cYou know I had a patient \u2013 I had to tell her the news that we couldn\u2019t see her,\u201d Dermish said. \u201cAnd she sat for a minute and then I asked her, \u2018How are you feeling with this?\u2019 And she said, \u2018I feel lost.\u2019\u201dOther providers in Texas have also reported massive cancelations this week.Amy Hagstrom-Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health and Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, said her clinics had been forced to cancel more than 150 appointments as of Wednesday.During an online event with anti-abortion activists earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton praised Abbott, who said his order applies to abortions. Ultimately, Paxton said, the order was \u201cdesigned to protect hospitals.\u201d\u201cThe truth is abortion \u2013 for the most part \u2013 is an elective procedure that can be done later,\u201d he said.This week providers and advocates filed a lawsuit asking a court to block the state\u2019s ban immediately.In the meantime, there is a lot of uncertainty around who providers can help at this point, including people with a range of medical needs.\u201cRegardless of their reason for seeking an abortion and their personal circumstances,\u201d Wheat said, \u201cevery patient\u2019s ability to access an abortion at our health centers is blocked right now by Texas Governor Abbott and Att. General Paxton.\u201dDermish said this has raised concerns among other medical providers, too.\u201cI got a panicked call from one of my maternal fetal medicine colleagues on Monday saying, \u201cI have a patient that was supposed to see you this week with a fetal anomaly,'\" Dermish said. \u201c'What is she supposed to do?'\u201dDermish said she is also concerned this ban will likely force women to travel to other states, which could create issues as state officials around the country try to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Historically, women in Texas have also sought to\u00a0self-induce abortions, as clinics closed their doors in the state \u2013which could raise another set of problems.\u201cHonestly, I wish Gov. Abbott or Attorney General Paxton had to make those phone calls to cancel those procedures for those patients,\u201d Dermish said. \u201cAnd then maybe they would have a sense of what the impact is on the people in our community.\u201dGot a tip?
