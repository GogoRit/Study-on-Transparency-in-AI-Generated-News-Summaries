    "description": "University of Pennsylvania professor Marci A. Hamilton draws upon a strategy used by anti-abortion advocates in suggesting a way to encourage (or coerce) more people into wearing masks to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Hamilton proposes requiring persons who opt not to wear a mask in public (1) to watch, on a large screen, an adult's beating heart for 30 seconds, and (2) to be read a statement about how their decision unreasonably endangers others.",

Hamilton \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted in:\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\n\n\nWith COVID-19 here to stay until science figures out how to treat and/or prevent it, the data is clear: everyone who can needs to wear a mask in public. We have had some declarations about an unchallengeable \u201cright\u201d not to wear a mask, but the United States has never been a country of rights divorced from common sense or the public good. In fact, the only right in the entire Constitution that is absolute is the right to believe whatever you choose under the First Amendment. Everyone has the unassailable right to believe what they want about mask-wearing. They simply do not have a right to refuse to do so where others\u2019 lives and health are at stake.\nOther than the right to believe, the other constitutional rights\u2014like a \u201cright\u201d to go into public without a face covering\u2013are balanced against the government\u2019s interest. It is the government\u2019s obligation to protect the vulnerable, and this is as good an example as exists of the necessity of enforcing a rule even if it does impinge on some rights. Life itself is named as a right in the Bill of Rights, and those who refuse to wear masks in public are threatening life.\nThe Framers of the Constitution understood that there is such a thing as too much liberty\u2014they called it \u201clicentiousness.\u201d Those asserting an unassailable right to go in public without a mask are taking license with the health of others. That\u2019s not a constitutional right we honor in the United States.\nIn a perfect world, an order to wear masks would now be heard as though it is in an echo chamber, starting with the President and bouncing through Congress, Governors, state, county, and local officials. We would see all of them wearing masks, social distancing, and demanding everyone else do the same. We would hear them endlessly pitching mask-wearing for the sake of the greater good of all. That is not happening, and, therefore, we have unnecessary infection rates and deaths on an inhumane scale. Hence, my modest proposal.\nIt occurs to me that perhaps we could take a page out of the pro-life movement to achieve the pro-life goal of reducing the spread of COVID-19. The movement has spent decades chipping away at women\u2019s reproductive rights, and as much as I disagree with their position as a matter of my religious faith, you have to give them credit. They have had some seriously innovative ideas. I would like to propose modifying one of their initiatives to save living people from COVID-19.\nThe pro-life movement has spent years pushing so-called \u201cinformed consent\u201d laws that require a woman to listen to the heartbeat of the embryo before being able to get an abortion. There are also more extreme tactics that would block an abortion by requiring the detection of a heartbeat, and banning all abortions as soon as it can be heard. Either way, the obvious tactic is to require the woman to think of the embryo as a human being that she would want to protect.\nThese paternalistic approaches have been subject to withering constitutional challenge, but I think they have the seed of a great idea for the times. There is hesitation on the part of lawmakers and law enforcement to enforce mask-wearing, so let\u2019s make it easier and turn it into a wake-up moment.\nMy modest proposal: For every person in public who is not wearing a mask and is within 6 feet of another unrelated person, they should be required to go to the station and on a large screen, view and hear an adult\u2019s beating heart for 30 seconds. Then the police will read (just like they read Miranda rights to suspects) the following: \u201cby not wearing a mask, you have endangered others. This is unreasonably dangerous behavior that could lead to someone else\u2019s suffering and even their heart stopping due to COVID-19.\u201d I\u2019m tempted to add, \u201cSo put on a damn mask,\u201d but I think we\u2019ve gotten the point across with the sound and image.\nIn the midst of this pandemic, it\u2019s time for the American people to adopt a pro-life attitude toward living human beings.\n\n\nPosted in:\n\nHealth Law,                                                                     Law Enforcement,                                                                     Reproductive Law \n\nTags:\n\nAbortion,                                                                     coronavirus,                                                                     COVID-19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: Marci A.
