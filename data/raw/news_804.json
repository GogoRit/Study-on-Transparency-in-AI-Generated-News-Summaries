However, the tables have since turned.\nFor the last 30 years, Polish women have been subject to increasingly restrictive abortion laws, culminating in the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling, which introduced a near-total abortion ban in 2020, leaving them with fewer sexual reproductive health rights than in fundamentalist states like Iran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the implementation of this barbaric law, at least six women have died because they were deprived of life-saving abortions \u2014 and those are just the known victims. They have names and mourning families. Many other cases remain unreported.\nBut Polish women and girls shouldn\u2019t be left to fend for themselves. Brussels must take immediate steps against the country\u2019s authorities and implement measures to protect women in Poland, so they can finally enjoy the same rights as those in Belgium, France or Germany.\nThe worrisome phenomenon of rolling back women\u2019s sexual reproductive health rights isn\u2019t exclusive to Poland. It\u2019s the result of an organized and well-funded worldwide movement, orchestrated by organizations that, for many decades, have been pushing an anti-feminist agenda, gradually gaining significant influence over right-wing politicians and sponsoring policies undermining women\u2019s rights. They\u2019ve been active in several European countries, including Croatia, Italy, Slovenia and Spain.\nIn Poland, it is Ordo Iuris \u2014 an organization closely connected to the Catholic Church and the country\u2019s ruling politicians \u2014 that became the driving force behind attacks on women and LGBTQ+ individuals. Their key \u201cachievements\u201d include bans on abortion and sexual education, as well as the creation of \u201cLGBT-free zones.\u201d They are also behind the country\u2019s sinister pregnancy register \u2014 a database offering public prosecutors all the information and tools to hunt women accused of abortion, and may well lead to the criminalization of miscarriages.\nRegrettably, however, the European Commission and the European Council have so far refrained from any action, claiming their hands are tied since abortion isn\u2019t under their competence \u2014 but the European Parliament dares to differ.\nSince the 2020 ruling, the Parliament has adopted two resolutions that not only condemned the violations of women\u2019s rights in Poland but also urged its government to guarantee access to safe, legal and free abortion services. It has adopted the landmark Mati\u0107 report as well, affirming that the right to abortion is a fundamental human right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, as the Parliament\u2019s Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM), we carried out a mission to Warsaw and held a hearing with the representatives of the families of the women who died because of this draconian law.\nBoth confirmed the immediate threat to women\u2019s health and life in Poland.\nContrary to the assurance of the Polish authorities, access to legal abortion in the country is currently negligible \u2014 in 2021, only 107 abortions were performed among a population of 40 million. And the restrictive legislation also has a chilling effect on doctors, who refuse to perform abortions out of fear of criminal consequences. Polish women are thus forced into clandestine abortions or to seek help abroad.\nFor the last 30 years, Polish women have been subject to increasingly restrictive abortion laws | Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images\nMoreover, virtually no abortions are performed in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape \u2014 something that is now strongly affecting Ukrainian women as well, many of whom have been violated by Russian troops and fled to Poland during the war.\nGathering all this information has now enabled us to propose a package of recommendations the European Union should urgently adopt.\nFirstly, we must remember that women\u2019s rights are fundamental rights, and that member countries have a duty to uphold them. Polish women now have fewer rights than when their country joined the EU in 2004, which is why the Council needs to address Poland\u2019s violations of women\u2019s rights under Article 7 of the Treaty of the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, by including the right to abortion in the next EU health strategy, the Commission should ensure all women in Europe enjoy full sexual reproductive health rights.\nSince many are forced to seek treatments abroad, we also need to find systemic solutions to facilitate this process. Thus, it\u2019s necessary to cofinance NGOs that support women against oppressive governments, and we need to improve cooperation between member countries, so European women can access free and safe abortion services within national health systems.\nThe recent case of an American woman denied a life-saving abortion while on vacation in Malta is just one of many examples of this need. And it\u2019s worth mentioning that this headline-grabbing case pushed the Maltese government to work on easing its anti-abortion law, the strictest in the EU, allowing for the procedure when a woman\u2019s life or health is at risk.\nOn the grave of Izabela Sajbor, the first known victim of Poland\u2019s barbaric abortion ban, there\u2019s an epitaph that reads, \u201cNot one more.\u201d\nThis motto, the slogan of large anti-governmental protests dedicated to her memory, should be engraved on all our hearts. And at a time when fundamentalists are usurping the right in order to make political decisions, the EU must fight for women with even greater determination.\nAll European women have equal fundamental rights, and the bloc must be there to safeguard them \u2014 especially when their own governments are the ones endangering their lives.\nThat is why \u2014 together with the socialist fraction in the parliament \u2014 we\u2019ve been working on an EU Charter of Women\u2019s Rights. Something that will guarantee standardized access to sexual and reproductive health care, including legal and safe abortion, in addition to key socioeconomic and political rights.\nAnd once this charter enters into force, \u201cnot one more\u201d woman in Europe will be deprived of their fundamental rights, and the future will finally hold real gender equality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Tags\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCatholic\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCold War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCooperation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoctors\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEquality\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinance and banking\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGender equality\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealth care\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealth systems\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHuman rights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLGBTQ+\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMissions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNGOs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParliament\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPatients\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolish Politics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRisk and compliance\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServices\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWar in Ukraine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen's Health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Countries\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBelgium\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCroatia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrance\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGermany\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItaly\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalta\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoland\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSlovenia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated People\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobert Biedro\u0144\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGermany promises Ukraine \u20ac500M more in military aid\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t1 HR ago \t\t\n\n1 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUS Defense Secretary Austin: We \u2018won\u2019t let Ukraine fail\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t2 HRS ago \t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEU agrees US deal to launch satellites with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t4 HRS ago \t\t\n\n3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEurope\u2019s soldiers keep quitting, just when NATO needs them\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n4 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMore from Robert Biedro\u0144\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpinion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo fight populists, go local\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nBrussels\u2019 plans to link funding to rule of law risks harming the people it wants to help.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJul 23\t\t\n\n6 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nApp Store\n\n\nPlay Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\nAgriculture and Food\n\n\nCentral Banker\n\n\nCompetition and Industrial Policy\n\n\nCybersecurity and Data Protection\n\n\nDefense\n\n\nEnergy and Climate\n\n\nEnergy and Climate UK\n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\nFinancial Services UK\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\nMobility\n\n\nParis Influence\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nTechnology UK\n\n\nTrade\n\n\nTrade UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nBerlin Bulletin\n\n\nBerlin Playbook\n\n\nBrussels Playbook\n\n\nChina Watcher\n\n\nDigital Bridge\n\n\nDimanchissime\n\n\nEU Election Playbook\n\n\nEU Influence\n\n\nGlobal Playbook\n\n\nGlobal Policy Lab: Living Cities\n\n\nLondon Influence\n\n\nLondon Playbook\n\n\nPlaybook Paris\n\n\nPOLITICO Confidential\n\n\nSunday Crunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\nEU Confidential\n\n\nPolitics at Jack and Sam's\n\n\nPower Play\n\n\nWestminster Insider\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nAll Opinion\n\n\nBeyond the Bubble\n\n\nClub Med\n\n\nDeclassified\n\n\nFrom Across the Pond\n\n\nUnpacked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Series\n\n\nCOP28\n\n\nLiving Cities\n\n\nPOLITICO 28\n\n\nQatargate files\n\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\n\nPOLITICO Pro\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\nResearch and analysis division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\nMedia Solutions\n\n\nResearch and Analysis Division\n\n\nPress\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nCareers at POLITICO\n\n\nTs&Cs\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nManage Privacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
