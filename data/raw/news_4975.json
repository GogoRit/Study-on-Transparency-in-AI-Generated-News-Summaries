Wade on Friday as Democrats vowed to fight back at the ballot box.\nThe landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision returned the issue of abortion access to the states, and due to a \u201ctrigger law\u201d in Texas, the state will ban all abortions from the moment of fertilizations starting 30 days from the court\u2019s issuance of a judgment, which typically comes about a month or so after the opinion.\nAttorney General Ken Paxton declared on Twitter that abortion is \u201cnow illegal in Texas\u201d and said he would be closing his office and \u201cmaking it an annual holiday.\u201d U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said the reversal of Roe v. Wade is \u201cnothing short of a massive victory for life, and it will save the lives of millions of innocent babies.\u201d And Texas GOP Chair Matt Rinaldi called it a \u201chistoric day which Republicans and Pro-Life advocates have waited for a generation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n U.S. Supreme Court rules there\u2019s no right to abortion, setting up Texas ban \n\n\n\n\n        \n          Updated:\n        \n        June 24, 2022\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats were livid \u2014 and acknowledged their best bet to restore abortion access in Texas is to beat Republicans in November.\n\u201cThe only way to overcome today\u2019s decision is to win this race for governor,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic nominee for governor, said in a statement. He later announced he would host a \"rally for reproductive freedom\" Sunday in Austin.\nThe GOP governor, Greg Abbott, issued a statement that was more understated than some in his party, saying the high court \u201ccorrectly overturned Roe v. Wade and reinstated the right of states to protect innocent, unborn children.\u201d\nThe Texas Democratic Party\u2019s co-executive director, Hannah Roe Beck, said in a statement that the decision is a \u201cblaring five-alarm call to action\u201d for November. Paxton\u2019s Democratic opponent, Rochelle Garza, promised that if elected, she \u201cwill work to restore abortion access and reproductive freedom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis fall, Roe is on the ballot,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a White House speech.\nWhile O\u2019Rourke has run a competitive race against Abbott, Democrats have limited opportunities to channel their energy down-ballot in November after Republicans redrew districts last year to shore up their majorities. The one major exception is South Texas, which Republicans are newly targeting this fall.\nNew U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores, a Republican from the Rio Grande Valley who won a special election earlier this month, did not hesitate to celebrate the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\u201cHonestly, this is a dream come true for me, for South Texas,\u201d Flores said on Fox News. \u201cIn South Texas, we\u2019re pro-life \u2014 somos pro-vida \u2014 so this was a big win for us and South Texas, but also for our country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Vallejo, a Democratic candidate in another battleground congressional district in South Texas, issued a statement reminding voters she is the \u201conly pro-choice candidate in this race.\u201d She said the country needs \u201crepresentatives that will codify Roe V. Wade and advocate every single day for our right to choose.\u201d\nWhile Democrats largely talked up the new stakes for the November election, some progressives offered ideas for what Democrats could do in the nearer term. Greg Casar, the Democratic nominee for the 35th Congressional District, called for \u201cimmediate action.\u201d\n\u201cWe must immediately direct public funds and private donations to help people get abortion care outside of Texas, beginning in one month,\u201d Casar said in a statement. \u201cWe must push all district attorneys and police departments to not arrest or prosecute Texans under these draconian anti-abortion laws. And we must fight like hell to expand the Supreme Court and pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act.\u201d\nSome conservatives in the Texas Legislature have already signaled they will prioritize legislation next year to block efforts to circumvent the state\u2019s imminent abortion ban. State Rep. Bryan Slaton, R-Royse City, quickly responded to Casar\u2019s proposals on Twitter, saying, \u201cWe will not allow this in Texas.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe left will surely fight to keep the abortion industry alive in Texas, but they will fail,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement.\nBy Friday afternoon, the chair and vice chair of the Texas Democratic Party had sent a letter to Democratic sheriffs, district attorneys and other local officials urging them not to enforce Texas' abortion restrictions after the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\"No matter what the United States Supreme Court says: abortion is a valid, safe, and important healthcare procedure that should never be restricted by any power or authority,\" the letter said.\nGarza, the Democrat running for attorney general, argued the decision carries especially high stakes for her race. The former lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 whose most high-profile work was on abortion rights \u2014 said in an interview that the attorney general\u2019s office will be the \u201clast stand for reproductive freedom in Texas.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cChoosing to litigate or not litigate is a very powerful thing that the office holds,\u201d Garza said. \u201cI as attorney general will not join in any sort of prosecution of people seeking access to abortion care.\u201d\n\nJoin us Sept. 22-24 in person in downtown Austin for The Texas Tribune Festival and experience 100+ conversation events featuring big names you know and others you should from the worlds of politics, public policy, the media and tech \u2014 all curated by The Texas Tribune\u2019s award-winning journalists.
