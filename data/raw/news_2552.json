I have friends there and near Italy, and they\u2019re all in lockdown. It\u2019s really bad over there. I didn\u2019t want to be any part of that.\u201d\nActually, Flannigan didn\u2019t have a choice but to come back to America. The Cheshire management called a meeting last week, days before the team\u2019s game against Worcester, and said the season was off until further notice.\n\u201cAmericans need to go home,\u201d Flannigan said of the directive he received. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t go home, you\u2019d be stuck there another three months. All flights were canceled as of Friday. So I got the first flight I could out of there.\u201d\nOnce at the Newark Airport, Flannigan said everyone coming into the country had their temperature checked. Some were asked to hold their breath for 10 seconds, and if they couldn\u2019t do so, suspicions rose on whether they might have COVID-19.\nOne of the symptoms of COVID-19 is shortness of breath.\n\u201cFor me personally, I worry more for the people with weak immune systems and the elderly,\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad over there (in Europe). Everybody is afraid of it coming to them.\u201d\nUp until the mandate that called off for the foreseeable future the British Basketball League, Flannigan was in one of the hottest streaks of his young professional career. His season averages of 13.5 points and 7.4 rebounds per game didn\u2019t reflect the five-game stretch in which he played the best basketball maybe of his pro career, one which began in the fall of 2017.\n\u201cI was really playing well,\u201d Flannigan said.\nAfter finishing his playing career at Cleveland State, Flannigan signed first with the London Lions, where he averaged 14.3 points and 5.9 rebounds per game, then played the second half of the year with the Svendborg Rabbits in Denmark, where he averaged 11.7 points and 7.1 boards.\nAfter working out with some NBA scouts in 2018, Flannigan signed for the 2018-19 season with the Wels Flyers in Austria. But a muscle strain put him on the shelf for nearly six weeks, cutting short his season.\n\u201cThey sent me home because they needed another player to win the division, and I couldn\u2019t play,\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cI was out the rest of the year.\u201d\nHealthy again, Flannigan signed with Cheshire this year and had just found his groove when the season was halted by COVID-19.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t played organized basketball in about a year, so I got off to a bad start,\u201d he said of the current season. \u201cBut the last five games or so, I really got my rhythm. Everything had been going good.\n\u201cThe international game is much faster. That was my biggest adjustment coming out of college. It\u2019s way more physical. Those players are strong over there. The Americans are a little more skilled, but those (international players) are so good with their fundamentals.\u201d\nAmong his teammates in Cheshire are Parker Jackson Cartwright, who played collegiately for Arizona, and Jalen Hayes, who played against Flannigan and CSU while a member of Oakland (Mich.).\n\u201cTo be able to play basketball for a job is amazing,\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cTo be able to travel make new friends all over the world and play a game I love \u2013 it\u2019s been a blessing.\u201d\nIf there was one blessing to the long flight from England back to America, it gave Flannigan some time to reflect on his Cleveland-area roots, not only in life, but also in basketball.\n\u201cI remember my eighth-grade year, we went to St. Vincent-St. Mary and LeBron (James) was there that day,\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cI played with him and against him. I wasn\u2019t anywhere near close what he could do, but I thought, \u2018You know, maybe if I work hard, I could do this.\u2019 LeBron\u2019s work ethic and passion really inspired me.\u201d\nThen a student at Richmond Heights, Flannigan left what he said would have been a powerhouse to go to VASJ.\n\u201cWe had guys like Mark Williams (Benedictine), Pharoah Brown (Brush),\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cWe had a powerhouse. Arthur Christian, Jamie Days, Mike McQueen \u2026\u201d\nAt VASJ, Flannigan was a four-time All-Ohioan \u2013 a three-time first-teamer, to be exact. As a senior, he helped lead the Vikings to a 25-4 record and the Division IV state title via an 87-63 win over Leipsic.\nThat team also featured Evansville signee Duane Gibson and a trio of eventual Division I college signees in Brian Parker, Carlton Bragg and Dererk Pardon \u2013 all of whom were sophomores that year.\n\u201cThe thing about that team, we were all friends. We were so close, the closest team I\u2019ve ever been on in my life,\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cWhen I was a junior, some of those guys told me I was part of the reason they came to VASJ. I took that responsibility of leadership seriously. I felt I had a responsibility to live up to with Carlton, Dererk and those guys.\u201d\nFlannigan said he still laments not winning state championships in his sophomore and junior seasons. The top-seeded Vikings lost to Cleveland Central Catholic, 61-48, in a 2011 district final in Painesville, then lost to Richmond Heights, 64-61 in overtime, in a 2012 district final in Garfield Heights.\n\u201cWe felt untouchable,\u201d Flannigan said of both teams. \u201cWe knew if we got by those teams, we\u2019d win the whole thing.\u201d\nThat put extra emphasis on his senior year.\n\u201cOh yeah, we wanted that so bad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always want to go on to the next level and be successful, but I wanted that championship first.\u201d\nFlannigan credits his upbringing in Richmond Heights, VASJ and Cleveland State for putting him in position to play basketball professionally. His goal remains to one day win a spot on an NBA roster.\n\u201cI just need the opportunity,\u201d he said.\nThat opportunity is on hold right now, and he understands why.\n\u201cI just love this game,\u201d Flannigan said. \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t have the ability to play, I\u2019d watch it every day.\n\u201cAm I discouraged not playing right now? Not at all. It\u2019s terrible to see what\u2019s going on around the world right now, and you have to put your life on pause. But right now, everybody\u2019s life is on pause.\u201d\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Share via SMS (Opens in new window) \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularFive hospitalized after shootings in EuclidFive hospitalized after shootings in EuclidMan with assault warrant arrested for stealing package in MentorMan with assault warrant arrested for stealing package in MentorMayfield hockey coach Steve Bogas passes away after valiant cancer battleMayfield hockey coach Steve Bogas passes away after valiant cancer battleFree agency has drastically changed AFC North landscape | Jeff SchudelFree agency has drastically changed AFC North landscape | Jeff SchudelKirtland-set \u2018The Melon Heads\u2019 screens in Mentor March 21Kirtland-set 'The Melon Heads' screens in Mentor March 21Election 2024: Four GOP candidates vie for two seats on 11th District Court of Appeals in March primaryElection 2024: Four GOP candidates vie for two seats on 11th District Court of Appeals in March primary2024 News-Herald hockey all-stars2024 News-Herald hockey all-starsElection 2024: Chris Callender, Katie O\u2019Neill vie for Democratic nomination for State Senate 18th District seatElection 2024: Chris Callender, Katie O'Neill vie for Democratic nomination for State Senate 18th District seatReward offered for man wanted by Euclid PoliceReward offered for man wanted by Euclid PoliceChester finds a home after 587 days at Euclid Animal ShelterChester finds a home after 587 days at Euclid Animal Shelter \n\n\n\nTrending Nationally\nCalifornia\u2019s largest new reservoir project in 50 years gains momentumUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesMarch Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentSocial media influencer arrested in Irvine on suspicion of joining the attack on the US CapitolInvestigators hunted one of Florida\u2019s most prolific serial rapists for decades.
