    "description": "The Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled two state laws banning abortion are unconstitutional, but the procedure remains illegal in the state in most cases. In a 6-3 ruling on Wednesday, the high court said the two bans are unconstitutional because they require a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d before a doctor can perform an abortion. The court says this language conflicts with a previous ruling it issued in March. That ruling found the Oklahoma Constitution provides an \u201cinherent right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy when necessary to preserve her life.\u201d The laws struck down Wednesday both included a civil-enforcement mechanism that allowed citizens to sue someone who either performed or helped someone perform an abortion.",

The court said this language conflicts with a previous ruling it issued in March that determined the Oklahoma Constitution provides an \u201cinherent right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy when necessary to preserve her life.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision was welcomed by doctors who said uncertainty about the state\u2019s abortion laws often forced them to make women facing severe medical complications and nonviable pregnancies to wait for their condition to worsen before they could perform an abortion.\n\n\u201cIn our practice we had cases where we would just have to tell women who we would normally offer a (pregnancy) termination to protect her health ... \u2018We have to let you go home and monitor your condition and if you start showing signs of infection or worsening blood pressure, then come back and we have the ability to legally treat you,\u2019\u201d said Dana Stone, an Oklahoma City obstetrician and gynecologist. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re at risk with these laws of going to jail for 10 years, having hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and losing our medical licenses.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS military chief tours arms plants with GOP lawmakers to show that Ukraine aid boosts jobs at home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma\u2019s push to weaken penalties for cockfighting is frustrating opponents of the bloodsport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath of nonbinary teen Nex Benedict after school fight is ruled a suicide, medical examiner says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the court\u2019s March decision that the requirement to wait until an active medical emergency violated the state constitution, there remained uncertainty because of the two laws that remained in effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith their decision today, the court has ensured that the March decision will be fully realized,\u201d said Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney at the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which challenged the laws on behalf of a Tulsa abortion provider. \u201cHopefully patients will be receiving the medically necessary care they need without waiting until they are on death\u2019s door.\u201d\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling last year that overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion, tighter abortion restrictions have been enacted in most Republican-controlled states and protections of abortion access have gone into effect in most that are dominated by Democrats.The laws struck down Wednesday in Oklahoma both included a civil-enforcement mechanism, first enacted in Texas in 2021, that allowed citizens to sue someone who either performed or helped someone perform an abortion.\u201cDespite the court\u2019s decisions today on SB 1503 and HB 4327, Oklahoma\u2019s 1910 law prohibiting abortion remains in place,\u201d Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement. \u201cExcept for certain circumstances outlined in that statute, abortion is still unlawful in the state of Oklahoma.\u201dOklahoma\u2019s 1910 law makes it a felony crime punishable by up to five years in prison for anyone to perform an abortion or help a woman obtain an abortion unless it is \u201cnecessary to preserve her life.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision was decried by Republican leaders and Gov. Kevin Stitt, who have worked for years to tightly restrict abortion access in Oklahoma.\u201cThis court has once more over-involved itself in the state\u2019s democratic process, and has interceded to undo legislation created by the will of the people,\u201d Stitt said in a statement. \u201cI agree with Justice (Dustin) Rowe\u2019s dissent, \u2018The issues presented in this matter are political questions, which are better resolved by the people via our democratic process.\u2019\u201d___Follow Sean Murph on Twitter: @apseanmurphy___This version has been corrected with the correct bill number as SB 1503, not SB 1603.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEAN MURPHY\n\n\n                Murphy is the statehouse reporter for The Associated Press in Oklahoma City.
