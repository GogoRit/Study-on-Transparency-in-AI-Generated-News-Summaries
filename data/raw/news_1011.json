Treatments for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are still legal under Texas\u2019 abortion ban.\n        \n\nCredit:\n REUTERS/Emily Elconin\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nTreatments for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are still legal under the state\u2019s abortion ban, according to state law and legal experts. But the statutes don\u2019t account for complicated miscarriages, and confusion has led some providers to delay or deny care for patients in Texas.\nTexas laws banning abortions make narrow exceptions only to save the life of a pregnant patient or prevent \u201csubstantial impairment of major bodily function.\u201d And lawmakers in recent years have clarified state statutes to say treatments for miscarriages, known as \u201cspontaneous abortions\u201d in medicine, and ectopic pregnancies, in which a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus and becomes unviable, do not count as abortions.\nBut the lack of clarity accompanying the threat of jail time and six-figure fines for medical professionals has led some hospitals and doctors in the state to deny or delay care for pregnancy complications, according to multiple reports. Doctors and experts also worry that patients with pregnancy complications may be too afraid of being accused of inducing an abortion to seek care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelays in care \u2014 particularly for first-trimester conditions such as bleeding, hemorrhaging, septic miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies \u2014 can become lethal, said Dr. Natalie Crawford, an OB/GYN and cofounder of a fertility clinic.\n\u201cThose can be acute life-threatening emergencies,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s why Crawford said it\u2019s important for patients to quickly seek medical care if they notice their pregnancy isn\u2019t progressing normally or they are bleeding.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re having severe pain, if you\u2019re getting a fever, you need to keep your medical team in the loop,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cWe want to keep you safe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases in which a medical provider may be hesitant to conduct a needed treatment, it\u2019ll be critical for patients to stay informed, seek help or get more than one medical opinion, said Joanna Grossman, a professor at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Dedman School of Law.\n\u201cMore than ever, I think people, patients really need to be extremely well-informed and really aggressive about advocating for their own health because the system right now is basically designed to fail,\u201d she said.\nBut for patients facing a medical emergency, or low-income or uninsured Texans, seeking a second opinion may not be possible.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has information on early pregnancy loss, finding an OB-GYN and having better conversations with your doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas\u2019 abortion laws penalize the person who performs an abortion and, under a state law from 1925, anyone who \u201cfurnishes the means\u201d for an abortion. But the National Advocates for Pregnant Women provide free legal assistance to women who have been charged with a crime because of a pregnancy loss like a miscarriage. You can reach them at 212-255-9252.\nDelays in care\nLast week, the Texas Medical Association warned that several hospitals in the state have turned away or waited to treat patients with pregnancy complications \u2014 including a physician in Central Texas who was allegedly instructed by a hospital to not treat an ectopic pregnancy until a rupture occurred. Such a rupture can be life-threatening.\n\u201cTo the extent anybody is delaying or denying care for ectopic pregnancy, they are simply misunderstanding the law,\u201d Grossman said.\nBut things can be murkier when it comes to treating miscarriages, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA miscarriage is generally defined as the loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy typically because of complications outside of a patient\u2019s control. About 10% to 20% of confirmed pregnancies end in miscarriages, but estimates are as high as 30% to 50% for all pregnancies, including those in which a person may not know of the pregnancy.\nThere is no treatment to stop a miscarriage once it has started, and miscarriages can become life-threatening to the pregnant patient if complications are untreated.\nBut in cases of unviable pregnancies in which fetal cardiac activity can still be detected, treatment to remove the expected miscarriage could be considered illegal under Texas\u2019 laws, Grossman said.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re really worried about is that period of time when what\u2019s going to be a miscarriage, if you let it take a natural course, might cause severe suffering, and/or death to the mother, to the pregnant person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do something to prevent that, you might be in fact performing an illegal abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what recently caused Dr. Jessian Munoz, an OB-GYN in San Antonio, to wait a day to treat a patient who had started to miscarry and developed a womb infection, according to the Associated Press.\n\u201cWe physically watched her get sicker and sicker and sicker,\u201d he told the AP. The patient lost liters of blood and had to be put on a breathing machine because of the 24-hour delay in care.\nAnother patient in Dallas was denied a surgical procedure for a miscarriage, according to The New York Times, and a Texas woman told CNN she had to carry her dead fetus for two weeks until she could find an OB-GYN willing to remove it. A recent study also reported 28 women with dangerous pregnancies at two Texas hospitals faced delays for care because fetal cardiac activity was detected, according to the AP.\nGiven the state\u2019s severe penalties, Grossman said medical professionals and their legal teams might err on the side of caution in regard to the law, even if it puts patients at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way the system is going to work is that the patients are going to always pay the price,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cBecause the providers have a choice whether to provide and the patients are the ones who need the care. But the incentives are all very strong for those providers to err on the side of not providing care.\u201d\nThere have been no criminal charges against providers since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in late June to overturn the constitutional right to abortion access that was protected by Roe v. Wade, but anti-abortion groups and state lawmakers have threatened to ramp up the pressure against abortion providers and their allies.\nThe Biden administration last week told hospitals they must treat pregnant patients who need an abortion to stabilize a life-threatening condition. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly sued the Biden administration over the federal guidance.\nFederal law typically trumps state laws, but it will now be up to courts to decide whether that will be the case in this instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Grossman said the delay and denial of care will likely become more common.\nDenials at the pharmacy\nConfusion around the laws has caused issues for patients outside of emergencies. Crawford, the OB/GYN and fertility clinic co-founder, said she\u2019s seen instances of pharmacies not wanting to fill prescriptions for certain medications that are related to abortions but being used for other treatments.\nThis represents more confusion around state policy. While another law enacted last year forbids dispensing and shipping abortion-inducing medications like misoprostol, mifepristone and methotrexate past seven weeks of a pregnancy, it makes exceptions for when the drugs are used for \u201cother medical reasons.\u201d\nMisoprostol is used to help prevent stomach ulcers, but it can induce abortions, particularly if taken along with mifepristone. For patients who are not pregnant, it can also open up the cervix and make surgeries safer, Crawford said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethotrexate, another abortion-inducing medication, is used to treat ectopic pregnancies as well as rheumatic illnesses, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and cancer.\nDr. John Thoppil, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said doctors usually note a diagnosis when prescribing medicines, and prescription rejections don\u2019t appear to be widespread. He said the association has been in communication with some pharmacy leaders to \u201chelp clarify proper interpretation of the rules.\u201d\nIf patients run into trouble filling prescriptions, Thoppil and Crawford say they should try to find another pharmacy or talk to their health care provider.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a large issue, but there are certainly anecdotes,\u201d Thoppil said. \u201cThankfully, I think there\u2019s still plenty of pharmacies that understand the proper utilization of some of the medications we use for nonelective [pregnancy] terminations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Southern Methodist University, Texas Medical Association and New York Times have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
