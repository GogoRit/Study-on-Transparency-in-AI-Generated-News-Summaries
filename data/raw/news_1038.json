Both she and Luci Willits voted against the resolution.\u201cWe need to get back to the business of Boise,\u201d Willits said, \u201cnot charge into these issues that nationalize our City Council that hyperpolarize local government.\u201dWillits said the city should focus on parks, libraries, managing growth, reducing taxes and making sure garbage is collected on time.\u201cThose are the things that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d Willits said.The resolution also says unless required by State or Federal Law, city funds will not be used to catalog reports of abortions being performed. This includes collecting and sharing identifying information with other governmental agencies about anyone seeking or receiving abortion services.Boise Police tweeted in June that pending legal review and input from the City Council, they were \u201cnot planning on providing additional resources to investigate reports regarding abortion.\u201d\u201cWe understand that there are many strong feelings on this issue and will follow the direction of our legal team,\u201d the tweet added.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorPending legal review and input from Boise City Council, Boise Police are not planning on providing additional resources to investigate reports regarding abortion.

Wade on June 24, Mayor McClean had expressed her anger over the decision.\u201cI am infuriated, and intensely worried\u201d she tweeted.\u201cThe decision to terminate a pregnancy is deeply personal and private. This decision by the Supreme Court will have devastating consequences on the health, privacy and economic independence of women throughout our community, state, and nation.\u201dAt the Council Meeting, she addressed concerns the resolution was not the City\u2019s business.\u201cAny time people in our community feel targeted or marginalized,\u201d she said, \u201cwe as a city have made statements to support them because the folks don\u2019t feel as though they can fully participate.\u201dCouncil member Sanchez agreed.\u201cI absolutely think it\u2019s our business,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about people being afraid to call an ambulance because they might be experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, that would all of a sudden not only put their lives in danger, but also their freedom.\u201dShe also said medical providers could hesitate to treat patients,\u201cAll that does is put our greater community in peril,\u201d she said.Boise joins other Democratic communities in Republican states seeking ways around abortion bans. Atlanta, Austin, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Phoenix and Tucson have all stated they would not shift law enforcement resources towards investigating and prosecuting abortions.The Idaho law banning most abortions in the state is expected to go into effect sometime in August.The city of Boise resolution is effective immediately upon adoption.This story was originally published by Boise State Public Radio.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorOPB\u2019s First Look newsletterSign up to get important news and culture from around the Northwest, delivered to your inbox six days a week.EmailPlease leave this field blankSign UpTags:\u00a0Abortion, Idaho, BoiseOPB\u2019s critical reporting and inspiring programs are made possible by the power of member support.
