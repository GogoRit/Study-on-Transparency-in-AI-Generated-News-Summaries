(AP) \u2014 A federal judge ruled on Friday that nearly all of North Carolina\u2019s revised 12-week abortion law scheduled to begin this weekend can take effect, while temporarily blocking one rule that doctors feared could expose them to criminal penalties.\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles sets aside that rule but allows 6the law\u2019s remaining provisions to begin on Saturday while litigation continues.\nAbortion providers had last week requested a blanket order\u00a0halting all of the July 1 restrictions pending their court challenge. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and a physician said several sections in the newly revised law were so vague and seemingly contradictory that doctors could unintentionally break the law, leaving them unable to care for women seeking legal abortions.\nBut the Republican-controlled General Assembly\u00a0passed legislation this week\u00a0revising or repealing nearly all of the challenged provisions, making arguments against most of them moot. Among other things, the lawmakers clarified that medication abortions will be legal in nearly all cases through 12 weeks, and that a lawful abortion remains an exception to North Carolina\u2019s fetal homicide statute.\nEagles, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, had said in court that it would be overly broad to block enforcement of the entire law. Instead, she directed that for at least the next two weeks, the state cannot enforce a rule saying doctors must document the existence of a pregnancy within the uterus before conducting a medication abortion.\nThe abortion providers\u2019 lawyers argued that the language raised questions about whether abortion pills can be dispensed when it\u2019s too early in a pregnancy to locate an embryo using an ultrasound \u2014 subjecting a provider to potentially violating the law.\n\u201cIf the pregnancy is in early stages and the physician cannot document the existence of an intrauterine pregnancy, then the physician cannot comply with this requirement,\u201d Eagles wrote. She said she\u2019ll revisit the rule as well as other challenges in upcoming hearings.\nPeter Im, a Planned Parenthood attorney, said the plaintiffs had already received much of what they had sought in the lawsuit through the legislature\u2019s revisions. And now with Eagles\u2019 order, \u201cit is clear that we can provide care to patients at the very earliest stages of pregnancy,\u201d Im said.\nLauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Senate leader Phil Berger, said that \u201cthe General Assembly provided the clarity physicians asked for.\u201d\nBefore Saturday, North Carolina has had a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks. The new rules, developed after the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022\u00a0struck down Roe v. Wade, reduce it to 12 weeks, but add new exceptions through 20 weeks for cases of rape and incest and through 24 weeks for \u201clife-limiting\u201d fetal anomalies. A medical emergency exception also remains in place.\nWATCH: The state of abortion access in America a year after Roe\u2019s reversal\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the abortion law in May, but\u00a0Republicans overrode him\u00a0using their veto-proof GOP majorities in both chambers. Cooper then\u00a0signed on Thursday the clean-up bill,\u00a0which had overwhelming bipartisan support. Although a strong abortion-rights supporter, Cooper said it was important to clarify the rules because the original measure was \u201cso poorly written that it is causing real uncertainty for doctors and other health care providers.\u201d\nGOP legislators backing the new restrictions called them a middle-ground change in a state where some anti-abortion advocates wanted a ban imposed as soon as an ultrasound can detect cardiac activity, or around six weeks. They also pointed to $160 million contained in the law for services benefiting children, mothers and families \u2014 spending that isn\u2019t part of the litigation.\nCaitlin Connors with the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America said Friday\u2019s ruling was \u201ca crucial win for the unborn and their mothers.\u201d\nCritics say the 12-week standard, along with new restrictions on providers, abortion clinics and patients, will make it harder for low-income women and those in rural areas to obtain lawful abortions. They point in part to a requirement that someone seeking an abortion must visit a provider\u2019s office in person before the state\u2019s 72-hour waiting period \u2014 already in place for years \u2014 can begin. Before, that initial contact could be done over the phone.\nBroadly, the new restrictions will \u201cabsolutely harm patients. Our patients are devastated and the doctors who care for them are devastated,\u201d Dr. Katherine Farris, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic\u2019s chief medical officer, told reporters Friday. This week, the group \u201chad to start navigating patients out of state, knowing that they would not be eligible for care\u201d starting Saturday, she added.\nThe new abortion law also says that starting Oct. 1, surgical abortions \u2014 also known as procedural abortions \u2014 performed after 12 weeks of pregnancy must be completed in hospitals. The lawsuit still challenges that requirement. New licensing of abortion clinics also is slated to begin in October.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights supporters gather to witness North Carolina Gov.
