Shortly before they began the demonstration \u2014 which organizers said was conducted with a permit \u2014 the group's president, Jamie Manson, led them in prayer.\n\"God of compassion, be present to all who have had abortions, may they feel your love,\" she said. \"Be with all abortion providers, may they be safe. Sustain them with your comfort, and your courage.\"\nShe also prayed for those who would participate in the March for Life, asking God that \"they listen to the voices of those who have had or provide abortions.\"\nThe group then used a projector to illuminate the facade of the basilica across the street with slogans such as \"Pro-choice Catholics you are not alone,\" \"Stop stigmatizing; Start listening\" and \"Mi cuerpo, mi decision\" \u2014 \"my body, my decision\" in Spanish.\nAnother image emblazoned the words \"Pro-choice Catholics\" on a Christian cross, and another declared \"1 in 4 abortion patients is Catholic\" \u2014 a reference to a 2016 Guttmacher Institute report that found 24% of women who procure abortions identify as Catholic.\nRepresentatives from the Basilica did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment about the protest.\nThe protest did stoke reaction on social media, however, with San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone quote-tweeting a picture of the protest with the words: \"The attempted desecration is enormous. Diabolical. Mother Mary, pray for them, now and at the hour of death. Amen.\"\nCordileone, a known conservative among U.S. bishops, has repeatedly suggested denying Communion to Catholic politicians who back abortion rights while invoking the Catholic Church's longstanding opposition to abortion. The issue became a subject of heated disagreement among bishops as they debated a document on the Eucharist throughout 2021, with some mentioning Biden by name. The final document, approved in November, did not single out politicians.\nDespite the controversy, when Biden met with Pope Francis last year, the president said the pontiff told him he is a \"good Catholic\" who should continue to take Communion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCatholics for Choice members stood quietly during their protest on Thursday, some holding electric candles and sharing supportive texts from friends who support their activism. Inside the basilica \u2014 the largest Catholic house of worship in North America \u2014 people participated in the National Prayer Vigil for Life, a few trickling in and out as the protest continued.\nMinutes after turning on the projector, a man wearing a red, white and blue scarf approached the group and began yelling, saying, \"There's no such thing as a pro-choice Catholic!\" After he noted the Catholic Church's opposition to abortion, he declared: \"Pro-choice Catholics are going to hell.\"\nWhen protesters quietly offered to pray with him, he rebuked them, saying, \"Why would I pray with you? You're not Catholic.\" A short while later, after he was approached by police and security personnel, he walked away.\nIn an interview with Religion News Service, Manson noted that a majority of U.S. Catholics \u2014 55% according to Pew Research \u2014 believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. In addition, a 2019 Pew survey found that an even greater majority of Catholics (68%) do not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"We wanted to be out here to say the March for Life does not speak for us,\" she said. \"The March for Life is not representative of the convictions of the vast majority of Catholics in the United States.\"\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on Dobbs v. Jackson, an abortion case that could overturn or gut Roe v. Wade. When activists assembled outside the court in December during oral arguments in the case, faith groups were well represented among anti-abortion advocates and those who support abortion rights \u2014 including Catholics for Choice.\nManson called it a \"frightening time\" for activists like herself, but she is primarily concerned for women who have had or are seeking abortions.\n\"Obstructions to abortion can disproportionately impact the poor, people of color, LGBTQ people, people who are already vulnerable or in states of profound powerlessness,\" she said \"They're going to suffer more \u2014 the poor will get poorer; the sick will get sicker.\"\n\"We feel a profound moral obligation to be engaged in this issue.\"\nManson added that she hoped the protest could spark dialogue with church officials, saying, \"I want them to hear abortion stories.\"\nA few minutes later, as the group began to conclude the protest, dozens of churchgoers began to exit the basilica. Organizers left up the lights for a few more minutes, watching as the worshippers craned their necks to see the words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMost Read Stories\n\n\n \n\n#1 New combative faith group to host 'Catholic prayer' for Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n \n\n#2 Attacking Pope Francis, anonymous cardinal seeks to curb the influence of his papacy\n \n\n#3 Here in the US, Catholicism is for sale\n \n\n#4 The Catholic Church needs married priests now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanRome biblical and Eastern institutes merged with Gregorian UniversityByCindy WoodenCatholic News Service\n \n\nNewsLife-threatening safety concerns keep Burkina Faso Catholics away from Sunday MassByTonny OnyuloOSV News\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanThe first outside legal analyses of Vatican's 'trial of the century' are in, and they're criticalByNicole WinfieldAssociated Press\n \n\nFrancis, the comic stripVaticanFrancis, the comic stripByPat Marrin\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR's Free NewslettersSelect any of the newsletters below, then enter your email address and click \"subscribe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per dayDaily Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updates: The latest news and feature articles\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Daily: (the latest articles, sent every morning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per weekWeekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Weekly: NCR staff talk music, television, books, movies and more\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Weekly: Environment editor Stephanie Clary dives into the week's climate change news\n\n\n\nMichael Sean Winters: The nexus between religion and politics\n\n\n\nNCR Book Club: Find your latest book to read\n\n\n\nScripture for Life: Reflections on the Sunday readings\n\n\n\nSunday Resources: Reflections on the readings sent two months ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x WeeklyBiweekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Francis Chronicles: Get to know the pope's pastoral side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Sections\n\n\nNCR Sections\n\n\nNews\n\n\nVatican\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSpirituality\n\n\nSunday Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Channels\n\n\nEarthBeat\n\n\nGlobal Sisters Report\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Menu\n\n\nWays to Give\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nYour NCR Legacy\n\n\nFriends & Tributes\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR\n\n\nRenew Subscription\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\nFree Newsletters\n\n\neNCR and Kindle Edition\n\n\nRequest a sample issue\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nHow to write for NCR\n\n\nLetters to Editor\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\n\nChange your address\n\n\nReprints\n\n\n\n\nAbout NCR\n\n\nMission & Values\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nStaff and Contributors\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nDonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Catholic Reporter\nFollow\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTikTok\n\n\nAdvertising Guidelines / \n  Terms of Use / \n  Privacy Policy / \n  Site Map\n/ Mailing Address: 115 E Armour Boulevard Kansas City, MO 64111 / Phone Number: +1-800-444-8910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
