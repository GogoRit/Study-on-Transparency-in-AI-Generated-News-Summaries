Lindsey\n\nHistorian,\u00a0Ohio State University\nMay 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n                The archive of written work and speeches delivered by suffragists simply doesn\u2019t indicate that abortion was at the forefront of discussions about women\u2019s rights during the mid-19th to early 20th centuries.\n              Illustration by Meilan Solly / Photos via Library of Congress, Allison Shelley / Getty Images, and Cynthia Johnson / Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nIn July 1869, an anonymously authored article appeared in the Revolution, a weekly newspaper run by suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Titled \u201cMarriage and Maternity,\u201d the essay deemed abortion a \u201chorrible crime of child-murder,\u201d albeit one practiced not out of malice, but desperation, \u201cby those whose inmost souls revolt against the dreadful deed, and in whose hearts the maternal feeling is pure and undying.\u201d\nSigned only with the letter \u201cA,\u201d the article has long been used by anti-abortion advocates as proof of Anthony\u2019s anti-abortion views and of a broader throughline within feminist thought and activism. This claim, however, ignores two key facts: first, that substantial evidence points to the author not even being Anthony, and second, that the essay argues against the criminalization of abortion, calling for \u201cprevention, not merely punishment.\u201d\nThe question of whether the architects of women\u2019s rights activism in the United States supported or opposed legalized abortion does not have a single, uncomplicated answer. But the debate, which tends to resurface whenever a new bill or court decision about abortion emerges, is back in the news following the leak of a Supreme Court draft majority opinion that would effectively overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that codified the right to abortion nationwide.\n\n\n\n    \n      \"Marriage and Maternity\" appeared in the\u00a0Revolution\u00a0in July 1869.\n    \n    \n      Lewis & Clark College Special Collections and Archives\n\n\nSince Politico published Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s draft opinion earlier this month, observers across the political spectrum have highlighted both the history of those fighting to uphold abortion rights and those fighting to dismantle those rights. This dive into the archives has sparked contentious conversations about the legacies of figures like Anthony, with whom both anti-abortion and reproductive rights activists claim ideological kinship. Divergent historical recollections and analyses aside, the truth of the matter is that Anthony, at least, almost never addressed the topic of abortion directly.\n\u201cWas Susan B. Anthony pro-life or pro-choice? The answer is easy: neither,\u201d Deborah Hughes, president of the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House, told Slate in 2017. \u201cThose are 20th-century movements, and she was a 19th-century person.\u201d\n\nPrior to the 19th century, people in what is now the U.S. engaged in a wide range of largely unregulated and culturally specific abortive practices. Before European settlers arrived in the Americas, for instance, some Native American nations used stoneseed, dogbane and other herbs to prevent pregnancy, in addition to taking abortifacients (substances that induce abortions). As European settlers arrived and forcefully established colonies in the names of their respective countries, abortion regulations continued to evolve. British colonies legalized pre-quickening abortions, which took place before the pregnant person felt fetal movement. (A term derived from quick, an archaic word for \u201cnot dead,\u201d quickening typically takes place between 14 and 26 weeks into a pregnancy.) Spanish and Portuguese colonies, meanwhile, banned abortion entirely. Despite variation in laws and customs, abortions were common in the U.S. during the early modern and colonial eras.\nFor enslaved Black women, the ability to induce abortions in the aftermath of rape by an enslaver or a forced breeding encounter was a form of resistance to the institution of chattel slavery. These women attempted to and succeeded in taking charge of their reproductive lives by concocting their own remedies to induce miscarriages and prevent their unborn progeny from being enslaved. Unsurprisingly, enslavers and plantation doctors were adamantly opposed to enslaved women\u2019s use of abortifacients, as they impacted the expansion of the\u00a0enslaved Black labor force.\nBefore the 19th century, cultural and religious opposition to abortion was rooted in expectations about abstaining from premarital and otherwise illicit types of sex. This disapproval wasn\u2019t firmly grounded in the question of whether life began at conception, but rather the fact that abortions served as evidence of sexual immorality and impropriety.\n\n\n\n    \n      An illustration of Ann Trow Lohman, a.k.a. Madame Restell\n    \n    \n      Public domain via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nOpposition to abortion also came from those concerned about the health risks associated with terminating pregnancies. In Connecticut in 1742, a wealthy, white 19-year-old named Sarah Grosvenor took an abortifacient\u2014most likely pennyroyal or savin\u2014after conceiving out of wedlock. When she fell ill, Amasa Sessions, the 27-year-old father of the fetus, recruited a self-proclaimed \u201cpractitioner of physick\u201d to \u201cremove her conseption\u201d by \u201cmanual operation,\u201d according to archival records. Grosvenor miscarried, developed a fever and died. Three years later, amid ongoing speculation about her death, local authorities brought charges against both the doctor and Sessions. The doctor fled to Rhode Island after being found guilty of a misdemeanor; the charges against Sessions were eventually dropped.\nBy the early 1800s, the legal, cultural, political, medical and cultural landscapes for abortion rights had begun to drastically change. Though common law offered a legal context for pre-quickening abortions and less regulation and criminalization for post-quickening abortions, by the 1820s, states such as Connecticut and New York had begun restricting or banning post-quickening procedures. The demonization of abortion providers also intensified. Madame Restell, a self-proclaimed physician who offered both abortifacients and surgical abortions, faced continued legal troubles and even imprisonment for her work. She died by suicide in 1878 after decades of vilification by the public, which deemed her \u201cthe Wickedest Woman in New York.\u201d\nThis 19th-century shift was largely prompted by the medical community\u2019s concerns about the risk of injury and death for those undergoing abortions, as well as emergent arguments about when life begins. The burgeoning anti-abortion movement culminated in the Comstock Law of 1873, which criminalized purchasing, producing or publishing information about contraception, sexually transmitted infections and diseases, and abortions.\nBy 1900, abortion was a felony in every state, with a few legal exceptions for terminating pregnancies in extenuating circumstances. Those opposing abortion, led by reputable organizations such as the American Medical Association, effectively ended legalized abortion. Meanwhile, those seeking and performing abortions continued to find ways to end unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement took shape around the same time as another key movement grounded in the future of women\u2019s rights: the campaign for women\u2019s suffrage. Though the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention is often identified as the beginning of the U.S. women\u2019s suffrage movement, the seeds of the struggle were present long before this historic convention. Notably, the right to abortion was not a central aspect of the emerging women\u2019s rights agenda\u2014but neither was being anti-abortion.\n\n\n\n    \n      Susan B. Anthony\n    \n    \n      Public domain via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nAbortion opponents who identify suffragists as foremothers of their movement often home in on unsigned articles in Stanton and Anthony\u2019s Revolution. The identity of the elusive \u201cA,\u201d who authored the essay that deemed abortion both \u201cinfanticide\u201d and \u201cchild-murder,\u201d is unclear, but as the Susan B. Anthony Museum and House notes, other Revolution stories signed by \u201cA\u201d hold \u201csome uncomfortable surprises for those who want to believe that Anthony wrote them.\u201d One story discusses \u201ca technical controversy about mechanics, hardly Anthony\u2019s field of expertise,\u201d while another sparked a debate in which the newspaper\u2019s editors addressed the author as \u201cMr. A.\u201d\nCrucially for modern\u00a0debates, the unknown author of the article spoke out against the criminalization of abortion\u2014a measure contemporaneously proposed by a prominent medical journal. \u201cI cannot believe such a law would have the desired effect,\u201d the author wrote. \u201cIt seems to be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains.\u201d After describing men\u2019s legal control over women, \u201cA\u201d lamented that the \u201cwife has \u2026 no right over her own body.\u201d\nEven as the author acknowledged women\u2019s lack of agency, they argued that abortions \u201cburden her conscience in life [and] her soul in death.\u201d This reference to the guilt ostensibly felt by those who undergo abortions is often cited by contemporary anti-abortion activists, who \u201cmiss the context and neglect to print the rest\u201d of the essay, wrote Anthony experts Lynn Sherr and Ann D. Gordon for Time in 2015.\nHistorians will likely never know who wrote \u201cMarriage and Maternity.\u201d What they do know is that Anthony often signed her articles with \u201cS.B.A.,\u201d not \u201cA.\u201d And abortion wasn\u2019t a primary focus for the Revolution, which chiefly functioned as a forum for the exchange of multiple points of view about the era\u2019s issues.\nUltimately, the archive of written work and speeches delivered by suffragists simply doesn\u2019t indicate that abortion was at the forefront of discussions about women\u2019s rights during the mid-19th to early 20th centuries. Suffragists are not on record in any overwhelming way as being for or against abortion, though it\u2019s reasonable to informedly speculate that at least some agreed with the broader societal move toward restricting or ending legalized abortion.\nIt\u2019s also possible that some suffragists, especially those who were formerly enslaved, embraced abortion as an extension of the autonomy and fuller recognition of personhood they sought via voting rights. Arguments for voluntary motherhood by unnamed women appeared in local publications like the Women\u2019s Advocate of Dayton, Ohio, with one author writing, \u201c[L]et us hear no more invectives against women for the destruction of prospective unwelcome children, whose dispositions, made miserable by unhappy ante-natal conditions, would only make their lives a curse to themselves and others.\u201d\nAccording to Tracy A. Thomas, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Akron, many suffragists were \u201chighly sympathetic to the reasons why women sought abortions,\u201d including \u201chusbands who refused to restrain their sexual demands.\u201d Still, concerns about addressing the conditions that led to unwanted pregnancies failed to produce a singular perspective on whether abortion should be legal or criminalized.\n\n\n\n    \n      Elizabeth Cady Stanton\n    \n    \n      Public domain via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nStanton, for her part, firmly believed in a woman\u2019s \u201csovereign right to her own person,\u201d which included the decision to be a wife or mother. In an 1856 letter to the Seventh National Women\u2019s Rights Convention, the suffragist wrote, \u201cThe woman is greater than the wife or the mother; and in consenting to take upon herself these relations, she should never sacrifice one iota of her individuality to any senseless conventionalisms, or false codes of feminine delicacy and refinement.\u201d\nWhile not a full-throated statement in support of abortion rights, Stanton\u2019s words do condemn forced maternity\u2014an issue inextricably linked to abortion access. She saw voluntary motherhood as a key element of women\u2019s rights.\nAnother complicating factor in the debate over suffragists\u2019 views is the lack of evidence of many non-white women\u2019s stances. Without the documented voices of Black, Indigenous, Asian\u00a0and Latina activists\u2014many of whom were excluded from the mainstream suffrage movement by Anthony and other leaders\u2014historians can\u2019t accurately make sweeping statements about suffragists\u2019 thoughts on abortion.\nLegality aside, people during the Victorian era still sought abortions, and abortion seekers and providers continued to find one another. The archives show that abortions continued legally and illegally, with both the support and ire of those committed to women\u2019s rights. Abortion rights only emerged as a primary issue in the space of public debate in the 1960s and \u201970s, during the U.S. women\u2019s liberation movement.\nAt a moment when abortion has once again taken center stage, those looking to the past for support of their respective positions would do well to remember, in the words of the Atlantic\u2019s Emma Green, that \u201c[t]he country\u2019s history has always been told through appropriated narratives, as later generations align themselves with the moral victories of earlier generations.\u201d The abortion debate is no exception to this trend.\n\n\n\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?\n\n\n\nClick to visit our Privacy Statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreva B.
