Her story of two teenage girls \u2014 Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) and Skylar (Talia Ryder) \u2014 who travel from rural Pennsylvania to New York City to access the necessary health care to handle an unwanted pregnancy struck home with audiences and critics. It still holds a 99% score on Rotten Tomatoes. For Women\u2019s History Month this year, we are highlighting films by women that capture not only what the past looked like, but what it means to be female today.Watch Never Rarely Sometimes Always Now.The official trailer for Never Rarely Sometimes AlwaysWriter/director Eliza Hittman on the set of Never Rarely Sometimes Always.The film began in 2012, when Hittman read about Savita Halappanavar, a young Irish woman who died of sepsis after being denied an abortion. Horrified that such a thing could happen, Hittman began considering how she could translate the story to film. By 2016, the elements that conspired to make that tragedy possible\u2014lack of healthcare, disinformation campaigns, attacks on women\u2019s rights\u2014were as present in the United States as they were in Ireland. \u201cTragically it became so easy to translate it to the States,\u201d Hittman noted.\u00a0Over three films, Hittman has proven herself, as Indiewire wrote, \u201cone of contemporary cinema\u2019s most empathetic and skilled chroniclers of American youth.\u201d In writing Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Hittman focused on the plight of one young woman and her friend living in rural Pennsylvania, a character who would have to come to New York City to get the medical attention she needed. To understand these women, Hittman traced the steps they would take in the film. \u201cI went to a lot of small towns in Pennsylvania,\u201d Hittman remembers. \u201cI got on the bus and rode it into Port Authority. It was really about asking myself, \u2018If I were them, what would I see?\u2019\u201d In addition, Hittman spoke to scores of young women in similar circumstnaces and visited both abortion clinics and pro-life pregnancy centers.Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) in Never Rarely Sometimes AlwaysShooting for 29 days in both New York City and Pennsylvania, Hittman kept their film world as close to real experience as she could. She cast newcomers for her leads. Flanigan was a punk musician who had never been in a film before, but whom Hittman got to know from her YouTube videos. HIttman even cast a counselor she met in a clinic in Queens, NY, to play herself. While shooting in Pennsylvania, the production team at one point had to make a statement to the police that they were not involved in human trafficking after a nasty rumor spread through the community. At a Planned Parenthood office in New York, they shot their story in front of an actual anti-abortion demonstration that just happened to occur that day.Even at the premiere of Never Rarely Sometimes Always at the Sundance Film Festival\u2014where it won it a Special Jury Award\u2014history and cinema collided. The day it was shown to the world for the first time, President Trump became the first US president to address the anti-abortion March for Life in person. But in dealing with reproductive rights, Never Rarely Sometimes Always is never a polemic, but a poignant and pointed observation of the lives of women. As the New York Times points out, it \u201ctells a seldom-told story about abortion. And it does so without cant, speeches, inflamed emotions and \u2014 most powerfully \u2014 without apology\u2026. Here, a woman\u2019s right to self-determination has become the stuff of a new and radical heroic journey.\u201dABOUT USINSIDERMOTIONPICTURES.ORGFILMRATINGS.ORGCONTACT USTERMS OF USECA NOTICEPRIVACY POLICYAD CHOICESYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 2024 Focus Features.
