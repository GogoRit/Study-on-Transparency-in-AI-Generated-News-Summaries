In reality, it is totally unsurprising that those who fail to recognize and respect the lives of pre-born children would also disrespect the property of born people,\" he said in an email.\n\"We will not be intimidated into silence, no matter how many times they resort to vandalism, harassment, and bullying. The stakes are too high.\n\"What they do to us is nothing compared to what they do to our pre-born brothers and sisters in the womb. We will continue to speak out on behalf of the innocent pre-born child, no matter what those who kill them do to us.\u201d\n\n\nPhoto: Contributed\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Homepage\nTyposNews TipsForums\n\n\n\nMust-Read Stories\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Vernon News\n\n\nRECENT STORIES\nCleanup could cost $6.4BElk Valley - 9:28 am\nMore weather records fallThompson-Okanagan - 9:19 am\nMissing woman locatedKelowna - 8:49 am\nBolsonaro indicted Brazil  - 7:42 am\nLiberals dodge Palestine voteOttawa - 7:41 am\nMore Top Stories >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate\n608 Glenmeadows Road\n4 bedrooms 3 baths \n$875,000more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalmon Arm SPCA Featured Pet\n\nCharming\nSalmon Arm SPCA >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan trapped in a clockMust Watch | March 19, 2024Jake Gyllenhaal up for iconic superhero roleShowbiz | March 19, 2024First time on grassMust Watch | March 19, 2024Daily Dose- March 19, 2024Daily Dose | March 19, 2024Gisele Bundchen refuses to eat sugarShowbiz | March 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\nNorth Okanagan Quick Links\nCity of Vernon\nVernon Discussion Forum\nDistrict of Coldstream\nVillage of Lumby\nCity of Armstrong\nCity of Enderby\nDistrict of Sicamous\nInterior Health\nOkanagan Regional Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net\r\n\nMake Castanet Your Homepage\nNews Tips\nAdvertising\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
