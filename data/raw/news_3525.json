Photographer: Ben Hendren/Bloomberg \u00a9 2022 Bloomberg Finance LP\nNews broke last month that Georgia Republican Herschel Walker not only encouraged his girlfriend to get an abortion, but he also paid for it. Since then, anti-abortion PACs have thrown $1.1 million behind his Senate run.\n\n\nMost of Walker\u2019s support has come from Women Speak Out, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission. That super PAC, which is affiliated with the nonprofit Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, has spent $989,000 boosting Walker or opposing his rival, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), since Oct. 4. It has paid for digital ads, door hangers, canvassing and mailers.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee\u2019s victory fund dropped $98,000 on ads backing Walker. The PAC for the nonprofit National Pro-Life Alliance donated $5,000 directly to Walker\u2019s campaign.\n\nSpokespeople for the organizations did not immediately respond to inquiries. Shortly after the allegations about Walker broke, a spokesperson for Women Speak Out said it was standing by the football star-turned-Senate candidate. \u201cHerschel Walker has denied these allegations in the strongest possible terms, and we stand firmly alongside him,\u201d said Mallory Carroll, a vice president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-life America and spokeswoman for Women Speak Out. \u201cTo date, our Georgia field team has visited more than 310,000 homes across the state in support of pro-life candidates like Herschel and against the extremism of Sen. Warnock and Stacey Abrams, and we will continue through Election Day.\u201d\nOn Oct. 25, the National Right to Life Victory Fund began running this ad on Facebook touting Herschel Walker's position on abortion.Facebook/National Right to Life VIctory Fund\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Zach EversonEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
