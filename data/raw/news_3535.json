Burbidge aspires to make abortion \u2018unthinkable\u2019 in his new role as chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee for Pro-Life Activities.\nBishop Burbidge was elected to the post Nov. 16 by his fellow prelates at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops 2022 Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore. The previous chairman, Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, was elected vice president of the bishops\u2019 conference the day before. Bishop Burbidge will serve the remainder of Archbishop Lori\u2019s term, through November 2024.\nReflecting on the vote on his \u201cWalk Humbly Podcast\u201d Nov. 18, he praised the efforts of his predecessor. He called the reversal of Roe v. Wade \u201cprobably the most significant pro-life victory in the last century\u201d in giving states the opportunity to protect the unborn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant time in the life of our country. We know that,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitically, legislatively and pastorally, we must do all we can to end the evil of abortion, which ends the life of a precious child and deeply wounds the child\u2019s mother.\u201d\nMany Catholics are uninformed about \u201cextreme\u201d state laws that allow abortion during all nine months of pregnancy until birth, he said. \u201cWe need people to be aware of this sad reality and to insist on the humane protections of the pre-born.\u201d\nSuch advocacy efforts depend in part, Bishop Burbidge suggested, on communicating how the church supports women before, during and after crisis pregnancies; provides adoption services; and works to bring healing to women and men involved in abortion.\n\u201cWe want you to know that there\u2019s every reason to choose life because we will be there to provide you with the counseling you may need or the financial resources or the basic necessities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to walk with moms in pregnancy and in crisis pregnancy and to assure them that they will never be alone.\u201d\nIn his new capacity, Bishop Burbidge will celebrate Mass and serve as principal homilist at the National Prayer Vigil for Life Jan. 19 at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The next day, he will participate in the 50th annual March for Life. He encouraged Catholics to attend both events.\n\u201cWe have to transform hearts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think a peaceful witness, a peaceful march and prayer are ways to do that.\u201d\nIn the diocesan Office of Marriage, Family and Respect Life, a cheer erupted when the election was announced \u201cbecause we have seen up close his deep and heartfelt commitment to protecting human life at every stage,\u201d said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bermpohl, executive director.\n\u201cWe have benefited from his stalwart leadership in our diocese and know that all dioceses now will as well. Bishop Burbidge teaches and leads his people as much through his action as through his uplifting statements and homilies,\u201d she said.\nBermpohl noted that Bishop Burbidge regularly celebrates Masses for the dignity of life and prays in front of abortion facilities. She added that he\u2019s a supporter of both the Gabriel Project ministry that offers prenatal assistance to pregnant women and Project Rachel\u2019s work to heal all those harmed by abortion.\n\u201cThere are so many ways Bishop Burbidge\u2019s leadership in the diocese advances a culture of life,\u201d said Virginia Catholic Conference Executive Director Jeff Caruso, citing the prelate\u2019s calls for Catholics to advocate for pro-life positions through the VCC website and email alerts. \u201cHis emphasis on communicating with elected officials to protect life is very effective and so important. His outreach and invitation to all of us helps us heed Christ\u2019s call to be faithful citizens who defend life to the fullest.\u201d\nBishop Burbidge also serves as episcopal moderator for the National Catholic Partnership on Disability, which helps equip dioceses and parishes with the resources to serve and fully engage people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. At the USCCB meeting, he invited his peers to collaborate with NCPD to more effectively respond to the pastoral and spiritual needs of those with disabilities \u2014 a step that further underscores the church\u2019s commitment to all human life.\n\u201cPro-life is making sure that every single human person is treated with the dignity and respect that belongs to them as a child of God,\u201d he said.\nSchweers can be reached at [email\u00a0protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTopics: Pro-Life \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorto Charities donates $200,000 to diocesan schools \n\n\n\n3/18/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     1\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual diocesan Women\u2019s Conference reminds women of their unique identity \n\n\n\n3/14/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     5\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Patrick Irish Hooley benefits Christ House \n\n\n\n3/13/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     1\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to eNewsletter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArlington Catholic Herald200 N.
