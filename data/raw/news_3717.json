As we fight to protect the right to life for all human beings, pro-lifers have been forced to grow a thick skin as radical abortion supporters heartlessly abuse us in our every effort \u2013 and this recent campus incident showed me once again how the abortion lobby doesn\u2019t care about respecting born or preborn life.\u00a0\nWhile my Students for Life of America (SFLA) group was recently tabling on our campus at Rider University, we came to face to face with the hatred and destructiveness of the abortion lobby. My group members and I were engaged in productive conversations about abortion with other students and while we were busy with peacefully exercising our First Amendment rights, a pro-abortion student snuck up to our table and stole our model of a ten-week old preborn baby. We use this model on campus because it can be helpful to show people fetal development as most students don\u2019t know that a ten-week old baby has a heartbeat, organs, fingers, toes, and fingerprints \u2013 but apparently this scientific reality was too much for the pro-abortion student to handle.\u00a0\n\nFetal models\nBefore we could realize what was happening, the pro-abortion student tore off the head of our baby model. She put the baby model\u2019s head in a nearby ashtray and threw the decapitated body in the grass. At this point, another pro-abortion student grabbed a wristband off our table and snapped it under his foot. In just a few short moments, they had cost us a lot of damage \u2013 and for what? How does ripping apart a model baby show anything other than hate?\u00a0We spoke to the student afterwards, and thankfully she replaced the model. \nOne of my group members began recording in case anything else happened, but one of the male pro-abortion students began to bully and imitimdate him into deleting the video. We could have rightfully kept the video as it was taken outside in public and New Jersey is a one-party consent state, but because of the extreme intimidation from the pro-abortion student, we were forced to delete it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe reported this incident to our campus security, and they are currently\u00a0 investigating what happened. We\u2019re so grateful for their dedication to protecting our group, and we hope that every other SFLA group has a wonderful security team like this because this type of intolerance towards pro-lifers has unfortunately been on the rise since the reversal of Roe v. Wade.\nThe pro-abortion mainstream media is driving the narrative that the pro-life movement is anti-woman, but being against the intentional killing of pre-born humans doesn\u2019t make you anti-woman. However, being for the intentional killing of pre-born humans does make you extremely ageist.\u00a0\nAs a woman myself, I laugh at the idea that being pro-life is anti-woman (after all, what about all those little, preborn women?), and I recognize the scientific reality that life begins at conception. My pro-life views are supported by overwhelming scientific evidence and 95% of biologists, and I know that this means that an innocent human being dies in every abortion.\n\n\nThis issue is one that many members of the Rider University community are very passionate about, and we are not willing to be quiet about our beliefs when there is so much on the line. This is truly a matter of life or death \u2013 and if I can be respectful of the abortion lobby\u2019s radicalism (even while they are trying to bully our club members), they certainly need to be tolerant of us.\u00a0\nAll we ask is for the opportunity to have productive conversations on campus without the destruction of our property, threats of violence, and intimidation. My group and I don\u2019t expect that level of consideration from the abortion lobby, but we won\u2019t be deterred. We will follow through on investigations into this incident, and we will never stop fighting to make sure every woman is supported and every baby has the right to life.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Blind Rage: A Clinical Psychologist Explains Why the Sight of Baby Models on College Campuses Ignite Outrage\n\n Post Views: 5,448\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
