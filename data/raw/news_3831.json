Nationally, Blacks and Latinos are being infected at disproportionately high rates.And one group is overwhelmingly serving on the front lines \u2013 women.Experts say women make up the majority of health-care and social workers and are more likely to take on caretaking roles for sick people and children at home.In 2020, 100 years after the adoption of the 19th Amendment, women \u2014 and women of color especially \u2014 are bearing the brunt of the essential labor during the pandemic, all while earning less than their male counterparts.While women have had many political victories over the last century, including electing a record number of women to Congress in 2018, advocates say great strides must still be taken in the areas of reproductive rights, equal pay, health care and improved maternal health outcomes for Black women, who are more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.The ratification of the 19th Amendment in practice only secured the right to vote for white women, said Franc\u0327oise Hamlin, associate professor of history and Africana studies at Brown University.Black women faced many barriers to voting and would not be able to fully exercise their right until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, she said.Indigenous women were also left behind because they weren\u2019t considered citizens until Congress enacted the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, said Loren Spears, executive director of the Tomaquag Museum, an indigenous museum in Exeter. Even so, many indigenous people continued to face discrimination at the polls until the passage of the Voting Rights Act, she said.\u201cThe first wave of suffragists, they did not want to include Black women,\u201d said Ellie Brown, development officer for the Women\u2019s Fund of Rhode Island, a research and grant organization focusing on women\u2019s issues. \u201cWomen, for them, meant white women.\u201dDivides remain in feminism \u2014 for example, the Me Too campaign, which launched a movement around justice for victims of sexual harassment and violence, was founded by a Black woman, Tarana Burke, who is often overshadowed by the Hollywood actors who widely popularized the slogan, Hamlin said.But scholars agree that movements have become much more intersectional.\u201cI think that there is more of a sense of, we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d she said.Feminism doesn\u2019t work if it doesn\u2019t include everyone, Brown said, and the issues that advocates need to expand beyond what are normally considered women\u2019s issues \u2013 like access to birth control and parental leave.All the major social issues of our time are also women\u2019s issues, because women are often the most affected by them \u2014 particularly women of color, according to Debra Mulligan, a history professor at Roger Williams University.Take the coronavirus pandemic. Nationally, 77% of health-care workers and 78% of social workers are women, according to The New York Times; 52% of all workers labeled essential are women, and women of color are more likely to be doing essential jobs than anyone else.In Rhode Island, 87% of health-care support workers are women, and nearly half of these workers are women of color, according to the Women\u2019s Fund of Rhode Island. Ninety-eight percent of childcare providers are women and 20% of childcare center staff are women of color.In 2017, 70% of Rhode Islanders on the state\u2019s family leave program were women who needed to stay home to care for family members. Of all Rhode Islanders who took family leave to bond with a new baby, 61% were women that year, according to the Women\u2019s Fund of Rhode Island.While women continue to serve in the most essential roles, both at home and in the labor market, pay equity continues to be a focal point for women\u2019s rights advocates.Nationally, white women earn 79 cents on the dollar, compared with their male counterparts, Black women 62 cents, Indigenous women 57 cents and Latina women 54 cents, according to the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington D.C.-based women\u2019s policy organization.In Rhode Island, women typically earn 84 cents on every dollar paid to men, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center, an organization focusing on gender justice. For Black women, it\u2019s 59 cents and for Latina women, 50 cents.Change is going to take an overhaul of the systems in place and a restructuring of power, Hamlin said.In Rhode Island, women make up 38% of the state legislature, while they make up about 29% of legislatures nationwide, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Advocates said they are encouraged by the selection of Kamala Harris to run for vice president with Democratic candidate Joe Biden \u2014 the first woman of color to appear on a major party ticket \u2014 but they cautioned that, if elected, Harris serving as vice president alone can\u2019t bring about the needed reforms without a broader cultural shift.\u201cWomen might have the right to vote and the right to play college sports and do all these things, but there\u2019s still not that kind of social change,\u201d said Kathleen McIntyre, assistant professor of gender and women\u2019s studies at the University of Rhode Island. \u201cThere are still ugly stereotypes and disrespectful patterns happening.\u201d\u2014 mlist@providencejournal.com(401) 277-7121On Twitter: @madeleine_listWage gap in Rhode IslandMedian weekly earnings for men and women based on educational attainment, according to the Women\u2019s Fund of Rhode Island.
