Bill Lee, does not make exceptions for rape or incest but allows for procedures if the life of the patient is at risk. Medical professionals are also mandated to show ultrasound images to the patient.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee speaks on April 30, 2020.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesHealth care providers would be fined $10,000 for violating the measure.Democratic leaders and the American Civil Liberties Union argued against the last-minute vote without any public viewing and warned that the measure would be hard on low-income parents who cannot travel out of state to get an abortion. The ACLU said it plans to take Tennessee lawmakers to court.MORE: Coronavirus putting future of state bills, grassroots efforts in jeopardy\"Lawmakers used this measure in a game of political maneuvering to pass the state budget \u2013 pushing it through without regard for the actual Tennesseans who will be denied access to the care they need,\" Hedy Weinberg, the executive director of ACLU Tennessee, said in a statement Friday.People wait for a Senate hearing to begin to discuss a fetal heartbeat abortion ban, or possibly something more restrictive in Nashville, Tenn., Aug. 12, 2019.Mark Humphrey/AP, File Similar bills that banned abortion procedures at six weeks of pregnancy were struck down in states such as Ohio.
