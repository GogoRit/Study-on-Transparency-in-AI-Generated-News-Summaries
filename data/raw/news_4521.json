In the US, feminism is under attack from the\u00a0right, the\u00a0left, and from within\u2014causing American feminists a \u201ctriple bind\u201d. As has historically been the case, the conservative\u00a0right attacks feminism by trying to incite a moral panic. Feminists are cast as scheming women tearing the fabric of family life by putting their careers and aspirations ahead of procreation or child-rearing, without a care for \u201clife\u201d as those in anti-abortion ranks would state. On the\u00a0left, feminism has also come under scrutiny in the backlash to #MeToo. Many on the\u00a0left criticize feminists for \u201cgoing too far\u201d and, in\u00a0so\u00a0doing, undermining the \u201ccauses\u201d of the\u00a0left in presidential elections, for instance. Men on the\u00a0left worry that their feminist counterparts are inciting a witch hunt, women on the left criticize other women for creating a moral panic around sexuality.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnd sadly, from within the feminist movement, the infighting has caused fracture, alienation, exile: in January of 2019, the Women\u2019s Marches almost did not take place, and those that did\u00a0were highly controversial. Feminist support of various male or female presidential candidates for the 2020 race further exemplifies this infighting, with some declaring that true feminists would only back a woman. While conflict within a movement is okay, expected even, feminists today are having trouble fighting and then staying in solidarity. What it means to be a \u201ctrue feminist\u201d is up for debate in the US, and it is undermining a decades-long cause just as we approach the 100th\u00a0anniversary of the 19th\u00a0Amendment.\u00a0 Learning lessons from global feminism can help us think about the future of American feminism.\nWhile conflict within a movement is okay, expected even, feminists today are having trouble fighting and then staying in solidarity.\n\n\nAcross the Atlantic, women are engaging in some of the same struggles as those of us here\u00a0in the US.\u00a0 Transnational feminists are finding their feet through a sisterhood and friendship formed between the threads of activism and shared struggles. Through the\u00a0essays provided here, we can see\u00a0that feminist human rights activists worldwide\u00a0are also experiencing a \u201ctriple bind\u201d.\u00a0These women are simultaneously fighting the state, their religions, and themselves\u2014all as informed by patriarchy. Many women struggle with expectations of womanhood as couched within these battles. But there is much to be learned from the way that\u00a0activists globally\u00a0engage feminism.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNotably, women in places like Iran, India, and Tunisia ground their feminism in solidarity at all costs. Perhaps this is in part because they participate in cultures that are less individualistic than the United States, but there is much to be learned from this unwavering sisterhood. Women like those I met in the Middle East and South Asia stand behind one another in ways that strengthen their movements, and when push comes to shove, they always choose the cause over themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Indian case is noteworthy\u2014wherein feminist activists focused on sexual assault came together with LGBTQ rights activists as well as sex workers rights groups. Harnessing a collective power allowed them to bring about major social change under one of India\u2019s most conservative regimes. The feminists I have observed\u00a0through decades of studying sexuality and gender rights in the Middle East and Asia\u00a0highlight the power of\u00a0coming\u00a0together across siloes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWith this solidarity comes a narrative, first borrowed from Western feminists, of feminism as \u201cfamily\u201d.\u00a0Feminist activists talk about their activist communities\u00a0as providing them family when they were exiled or felt disconnected from their own families. However, their narrative of\u00a0\u201cfamily\u201d\u00a0is not predicated on always agreeing with each other. \u201cHow many families do you know that\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0fight? That\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0have conflict?\u201d\u00a0Renu, a feminist rights activist from India\u00a0asked me one day. Their deployment of the term \u201cfamily\u201d means a creating space that is safe enough\u00a0to\u00a0fight. They believe that internal conflict makes their families\u2014and their cause\u2014better. And, like a family, they may fight within, but when it comes to turning to the outside world, they support one another.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother important component of the feminisms I have been researching in West Asia is the commitment to sharing the stage while calling for social change. For example, when movements such as Iran\u2019s Green movement, a civil rights type movement borne of the youth and feminist movements in Iran, was taking shape, there was not one clear leader. The same could be said of the Arab Spring in Tunisia. In fact, when these movements were happening, American journalists often called me asking for specific names of \u201cleaders\u201d or \u201ciconic figures\u201d whom they could interview.\u00a0 These journalists were surprised that one or a handful of people could not be\u00a0singled out\u2014las this was a deliberate strategy:\u00a0to not get mired in the power dynamics of who holds the bullhorn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nComing together to share our struggles \u2013different and similar as they are \u2013 is the best way to inspire the coming generations of feminists.\u00a0\u00a0The essays in this section provide\u00a0a welcome opportunity for\u00a0readers\u00a0who are interested in\u00a0feminist\u00a0issues to explore a different kind of feminism, and the\u00a0impact of\u00a0that feminism on\u00a0individual\u2019s\u00a0lives\u00a0across the globe.\u00a0Through\u00a0the stories\u00a0presented here,\u00a0we see how individual change can\u00a0bring about\u00a0systemic change and vice versa.\u00a0\n\n\nWomen from the\u00a0global South\u00a0have been glossed over as victims, people without agency, who need to be \u201csaved\u201d by American intervention. The remedy for this is a nuanced, story-driven look at activism by women in the global South.\u00a0The authors in this section complicate this view.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFeminism in America and elsewhere\u00a0is trying to define itself, figure out what to do next\u00a0in this era of social media and fake news. But\u00a0we\u00a0don\u2019t need to\u00a0start all over. This is where\u00a0the work of these authors comes in.\u00a0By\u00a0calling attention to\u00a0the presence of a strong feminist-\u00a0driven resistance around the world, and a resistance that is messy at times and requires the resilience that comes from the bonds of friendship, that can inspire readers globally and help us view\u00a0feminism\u00a0in a more nuanced way.\n\u00a0\n\nThis piece is part of a series published in partnership with Occidental College\u2019s\u202fYoung Initiative on the Global Political Economy, the\u202fdivision of Social Sciences at Arizona State University, and USC\u2019s\u202fInstitute on Inequalities in Global Health.
