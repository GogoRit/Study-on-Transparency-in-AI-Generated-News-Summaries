He launched a campus initiative to support student parents, organized debates with pro-abortion student organizations, spoke before his state legislators, and participated in many other pro-life projects.\nPhoto credit: 40 Days for Life\nJohn Mark is a\u00a0rockstar\u00a0pro-life student leader. He credits his growth in leadership to the support he has found from pro-life mentors. And, as mentioned by 40 Days for Life, he has spearheaded tons\u00a0of pro-life activities on campus.\nNow What?\u00a0\nWe asked John Mark what his plans were for his $4,040 scholarship\u2026 and we loved his answers! John Mark said:\n\n\u201cI will be using the scholarship for the Students for Life group on campus and perhaps towards the formation of a Pro-Life Future group for our local young adults (I\u2019m a senior now, so that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s on my agenda going forward).\nRight now, the plan is to create a small endowment that will be invested and will feed returns to the organization.\nAnd yes, we\u2019d be using most of the funds that come from the endowment towards our group\u2019s Pregnant on Campus Initiative. Right now, our babysitting program, modeled after that of Notre Dame\u2019s, is just taking off and we have to run background checks on babysitting students and pay for basic supplies in order to pull that off.\n\n\nThe other expense would be for our Faculty Support Program (we take SFLA\u2019s \u201cI Support Pregnant and Parenting Students\u201d stickers and ask faculty to put them on their doors/computers/mugs. We also give faculty members gift bags to give to pregnant or parenting students who come to them and give them on-boarding questionnaires that they can then fill out and give to A Moment of Hope \u2013 the local sidewalk counseling ministry that helps moms with pregnancy care teams). We\u2019ve been REALLY excited by the faculty program and its potential and if I had one thing to share with other student orgs it would probably be that.\u00a0\n\nSo\u2026 yes. John Mark is the PERFECT recipient of some extra cash to fund his many amazing ideas. The fact that he went to school for accounting was just an added bonus!\nOther Cool Things John Mark Does\n\nI spend a lot of time brainstorming new ideas for pro-life advocacy. My scholarship application stood out because of an idea I had to beam WiFi into the local Planned Parenthood and when a person tries to log in to the network, they\u2019d see a phone helpline and lead to the sidewalk counseling org\u2019s website. We\u2019re developing it further now so that it can offer comprehensive and interactive support, but for now that\u2019s all it is.\nWe hold debates with College Democrats. As part of SFLA\u2019s initiative, we\u2019ve also shown the movies \u201cUnplanned\u201d and \u201cOctober Baby\u201d on campus. We launched an initiative on campus to wear pro-life shirts every Thursday and we hold social events like shag dancing, going to the fair or zoo, or whatever else we\u2019d like to do while wearing the shirts (it helps make just normal events suddenly \u201cgroup events\u201d). It\u2019s been a great way to draw in fringe members.\n\nWe helped launch a sister student group at another local Christian college (Advocates for Life of Columbia International University \u2013 they\u2019re doing really great!). I\u2019m working with my SFLA Regional Coordinator, Brooke, to try to reach the homeschooling community and equip high schoolers for pro-life advocacy.\u00a0\nI\u2019m also working with the president of the CIU group to get a mission launched out in Uganda with the Africa Life Youth Foundation to help train and equip pro-life students in that country in student activism (it\u2019s also the focus of my thesis project).\u00a0\nI launched our group\u2019s website, Facebook page, and Twitter account last year after Students for Life\u2019s Paid Family Leave lobbying effort in DC (with Students for Life of America) inspired me to do more, so that was a real pivotal part of my activism.\n\nCongrats, John Mark! We cannot wait to see the amazing things that come of this generous scholarship.\n\n Post Views: 1,039\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
