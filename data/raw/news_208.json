West spoke about abortion and his idea for a \"maximum increase\" that would incentivize couples to have children.\"I almost killed my daughter,\" he told the crowd, according to\u00a0Elle.\u00a0\"My girlfriend called me screaming, crying. I\u2019m a rapper. And she said, 'I\u2019m pregnant.' She was crying ... Even if my wife were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into this world, when I did not want to. She stood up, and she protected that child.\"West also shared that his own father considered abortion when his mother became pregnant with him.\"My dad wanted to abort me,\" he said. \"My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy.\"He then explained his idea for a \"maximum increase\" if he was elected into office. \"The maximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars or something in that range,\" he explained. \"If you had the opportunity to be given a million dollars, just for being pregnant, would you have considered it? And then everybody would start having children, the greatest gift of life.\"A source told Entertainment Tonight on Monday (July 20) that Kardashian, along with West's family and friends, are worried about him. The source also revealed that the reality star was hurt by her husband's comments.\"Kanye isn\u2019t in a good place and isn\u2019t listening to anyone trying to talk him into getting help,\" the source told the outlet. \"Kim is upset with Kanye for his rants yesterday, especially talking about the possibility of having an abortion and not giving birth to North. She knows this is something North will see when she gets older and that\u2019s heartbreaking.\"Celebrities Who Support AbortionFiled Under: Kanye West, Kim Kardashian-WestCategories: Celebrity News, NewsCommentsLeave A CommentMore From PopCrushAmber Rose Wants $20 Million Compensation From Kanye West for Influencing HimAmber Rose Wants $20 Million Compensation From Kanye West for Influencing HimNorth West Follows in Kanye\u2019s Footsteps With New AlbumNorth West Follows in Kanye\u2019s Footsteps With New AlbumFans React to Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign\u2019s Missing \u2018Vultures 2\u2032 AlbumFans React to Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign\u2019s Missing \u2018Vultures 2\u2032 AlbumKanye West and Ty Dolla Sign Unable to Go on Tour With Live Nation and AEG: REPORTKanye West and Ty Dolla Sign Unable to Go on Tour With Live Nation and AEG: REPORTKanye West Demands Ex-Wife Kim Kardashian Pull Their Kids From SchoolKanye West Demands Ex-Wife Kim Kardashian Pull Their Kids From SchoolKanye West Refuses to Use Bunny Pen to Sign Fan\u2019s AutographKanye West Refuses to Use Bunny Pen to Sign Fan\u2019s AutographKanye West Tells People Not to Buy \u2018Fake\u2019 Yeezys After Adidas Starts Selling Rest of Existing Yeezy SneakersKanye West Tells People Not to Buy \u2018Fake\u2019 Yeezys After Adidas Starts Selling Rest of Existing Yeezy SneakersKanye West\u2019s Wife Bianca Censori Wears NSFW Outfit to Milan Fashion Week 2024Kanye West\u2019s Wife Bianca Censori Wears NSFW Outfit to Milan Fashion Week 2024Kanye West Claims He\u2019s Been \u2018More Helpful\u2019 Than \u2018Harmful\u2019 to Taylor Swift\u2019s CareerKanye West Claims He\u2019s Been \u2018More Helpful\u2019 Than \u2018Harmful\u2019 to Taylor Swift\u2019s CareerInformationContact UsPrivacyAdvertiseConsent SettingsExercise My Data RightsFollow UsVisit us on YoutubeVisit us on FacebookVisit us on Twitter2024 PopCrush, Townsquare Media, Inc.
