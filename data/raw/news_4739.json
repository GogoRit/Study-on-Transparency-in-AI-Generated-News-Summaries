So for years, Cheryl Bachelder kept quiet. She stood out professionally as the rare female CEO of a major corporation, overseeing Popeyes while chasing after three daughters and, eventually, four grandsons. As a Christian, she watched with distaste as her fellow business leaders indulged the decadence and money-fueled antics of the 1980s and \u201990s, posing on magazine covers with jets and girls. She and her husband donated to candidates for political office whom they knew and personally trusted. But because she oversaw a large, publicly traded company, Bachelder mostly kept her views on one particularly controversial issue secret. \u201cIf I go to lunch with a good friend, and they find out I\u2019m pro-life, I can tell you the look on their face,\u201d she told me. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re kidding me. You are an educated, CEO woman and you\u2019re pro-life. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201dRecently, Bachelder has become captivated by what will happen if the anti-abortion-rights movement succeeds in its goal to make abortion illegal in the United States. \u201cWhat if there were a lot more God-given babies, and we were, as a community, completely unprepared to help their mothers?\u201d she said. Now that she\u2019s retired, Bachelder is willing to speak publicly about her views on abortion\u2014our conversation was the first time she had spoken with a journalist for a national news outlet about her involvement in the anti-abortion-rights movement.Activists in that movement are working towards a grand, and perhaps fantastical, vision: a world where abortion is not just illegal, but unthinkable, and where babies are much more common as a result. This future has felt more tangible since the election of Donald Trump, who appointed two justices to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who are skeptical of the constitutional right to abortion laid out in Roe v. Wade. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the staunchest defenders of abortion on the Court, recently hospitalized and going through a new round of chemotherapy, it\u2019s possible that abortion rights will face an existential challenge within the next few years. Anti-abortion-rights activists realize that this moment of triumph will require planning\u2014and infrastructure. \u201cThe magnitude of that question is huge,\u201d Bachelder said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say every community is unprepared to answer that question today\u2014probably hasn\u2019t even thought about it.\u201dShe has long believed that life begins at conception and that death is \u201cGod-ordained\u201d and should not be invited early with assisted suicide or other kinds of interventions. She and her husband have donated to faith-based organizations that provide pregnancy support and attempt to direct people away from abortion. But she nevertheless worries about getting into \u201cthe mud-throwing conversations of politics,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually work on solving things, in the business world. We don\u2019t have any time to yell and scream and throw things.\u201d She longs, in other words, for association with an anti-abortion-rights movement that is apolitical, even though abortion is one of the most politically charged topics of our time.Read: The progressive roots of the pro-life movementLate last year, Bachelder attended a fundraiser hosted by the Susan B. Anthony List, or SBA List, the anti-abortion-rights organization that has arguably had the most influence over Trump\u2019s judicial appointments and voter outreach on this issue, at a home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a tony city north of Atlanta. She and a group of friends, mostly other business leaders, were there to brainstorm all the community support systems that would need to be stronger in a world where abortion is illegal: mental-health services, addiction-recovery programs, affordable child care. Many of their proposed solutions didn\u2019t touch the messy business of politics. One woman even suggested that they consider taking pregnant women into their homes. Wow, Bachelder said to herself, I haven\u2019t thought about that. Along with other members of this group, Bachelder agreed to financially back an SBA List test program in Georgia called PLAN\u2014the Pregnancy and Life Assistance Network\u2014that would compile and publicize resources already available to women dealing with unplanned pregnancies, modeled after a version of the program in Northern Virginia. In theory, it\u2019s an ambitious effort to find common ground between hard-core anti-abortion-rights activists and people who want to help pregnant women but may not be convinced that abortion should be completely banned.Marjorie Dannenfelser, the head of the SBA List, brought White House-branded Twizzlers and a commemorative plate along to the gathering\u2014spoils of her success in Washington. \u201cWe believe we are coming much closer to a different kind of world, where Roe v. Wade is either unrecognizable because it\u2019s been chipped away or it\u2019s overturned and laws start to flourish in states that reflect the will of the people who live there,\u201d she told me. Over the past year, the SBA List\u2019s research organization, the Charlotte Lozier Institute, has undertaken a massive effort to look at the state resources available to pregnant women and children, including housing, medical centers, income limits for Medicaid, and more. This served as a foundation for PLAN, which is still in its early stages. The project\u2014imagining the \u201cbeatific vision\u201d of a post-Roe world, as Dannenfelser put it\u2014is partly pitched at people like Bachelder who oppose abortion but shy away from partisan battles. \u201cA lot of donors, a lot of people in the evangelical community, a lot of breathing human beings just hate politics right now,\u201d Dannenfelser said. She spends her days in the \u201croughest area\u201d of politics, she added, fighting over a controversial issue in tightly contested elections. \u201cMy dream, and my belief, is that at the heart of the pro-life movement, there is not that dissonance\u201d of political opposition.There is an inherent tension in an anti-abortion-rights project designed to rally social services for women, no matter how ostensibly apolitical it may be. Over the past two decades, the anti-abortion-rights movement has aligned itself almost exclusively with the GOP, which generally favors cutting government funding for housing, food stamps, and other programs that support poor women and children. No group has solidified this partisan alignment more than the SBA List, which pours money and manpower into supporting Republicans in competitive races. As Democrats more aggressively pursue the expansion of abortion rights, the SBA List sees the Republican Party as its only viable ally, at least at the national level.Bachelder envisions a future stage of the PLAN project in which policy makers would do a version of the \u201cgap-planning analysis\u201d that businesses use to anticipate what customers\u2014in this case, pregnant women\u2014might need. But getting there, to a place where most anti-abortion-rights legislators would also champion the expansion of social services, would require a massive political realignment. Although a post-Roe world has seemed more possible than ever lately, it\u2019s also a ways off.Read: When conservative justices revoltThis summer, the anti-abortion-rights movement suffered a major defeat at the Supreme Court, when Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal wing in June Medical Services v. Russo to strike down a Louisiana law that would have restricted abortion access. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence lashed out at Roberts in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, calling him \u201ca disappointment to conservatives.\u201dSome anti-abortion-rights activists may dream of building a postabortion future. But for the present, the political fight is all-consuming. \u201cOne thing is clear,\u201d Pence tweeted in June: \u201cWe need more Conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. #FourMoreYears.\u201dEmma Green is a staff writer at The New Yorker.
