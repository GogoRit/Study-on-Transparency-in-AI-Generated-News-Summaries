(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican-controlled Iowa Legislature, in a daylong special legislative session, passed legislation late Tuesday to outlaw most abortions in Iowa after six weeks of gestation.\nThe House adjourned just after 9 p.m. Tuesday after sending House File 732 to the Senate with a vote of 56-34. Rep. Zach Dieken, R-Granville, and Rep. Mark Cisneros, R-Muscatine, voted no and 10 House members were absent.\u00a0 \nAbout two hours later, the Senate voted 32-17 to pass the bill, with one Republican, Sen. Mike Klimesh of Spillville, voting no. Abortion-rights supporters shouted from the gallery, causing the Senate president to ask troopers to eject them.\nGov. Kim Reynolds said in a statement she would sign the bill Friday, after which it will take effect immediately. She called the special session after the Iowa Supreme Court, split 3-3, left in place an injunction that blocked enactment of a nearly identical 2018 law.\n\u201cThe Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement. \u201cThe voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed.\u201d\nThe bill would prohibit abortion after embryonic cardiac activity can be detected, usually as early as six weeks after conception. The bill contains exceptions for rape or incest reported within a certain period of time to law enforcement or a medical professional, or for the life of the pregnant patient.\n  State Sen. Amy Sinclair is a Republican from Allerton. (Photo courtesy of Iowa Legislature)\n\u201cMr. President, this bill ensures all life is protected when a heartbeat is detected,\u201d Sen. Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, said in opening remarks on the bill. \u201cThe child in her mother\u2019s womb has her own heartbeat, her own DNA. She\u2019s a baby, and she deserves the same protections as any other baby in the state.\u201d\nDemocrats in both chambers offered amendments and argued in favor of broadening the exceptions, without success.\nRepublicans defeated amendments to eliminate the requirement that rape or incest must be reported to authorities and to create an exception for pregnant patients age 12 or younger or with mental health conditions or a developmental disability.\nAlthough the bill does include exceptions for rape and incest, the bill specifies a 45-day limit for a rape to be reported or 140 days for incest to be reported for the crime to qualify as an exception to the abortion prohibition.\nDemocrats in both chambers tried to eliminate the reporting limit.\n\u201cI am appreciative that the current bill acknowledges that the survivors of rape and incest have an option, I would just like it to be a little less restrictive,\u201d House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst D-Polk, said during floor debate.\nWomen who become pregnant as a result of rape or incest often do not feel safe reporting it, lawmakers said.\n  State Rep. Austin Baeth is a Democrat from Des Moines. (Photo courtesy of the Iowa Legislature)\n\u201cWe know, folks, that women who are the survivors of rape and incest, for a myriad of reasons, including fear for their own safety, are not able to safely report rape or incest and therefore, the law as it is currently written, would be forcing these women to carry out their pregnancy because they were not able to safely report what happened,\u201d Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, a physician, said.\u00a0\nDemocrats in both chambers also attempted, unsuccessfully, to include mental health concerns as an exception.\n\u201cThe number one cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States is related to mental health, suicide or substance overdose,\u201d Baeth said.\u00a0\nRep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Dubuque, the bill\u2019s floor manager, responded by saying, \u201cI would like to recognize that abortion isn\u2019t a treatment for mental illness. Obviously if we have someone whose life is in danger, a doctor should take an approach to make sure they immediately refer them to inpatient care.\u201d\nDebate in the Senate was contentious almost from the beginning.\n\u201cSenator Sinclair, don\u2019t piss down my back and tell me it\u2019s raining,\u201d Sen. Liz Bennett, D-Cedar Rapids, said at one point during debate, prompting a call for decorum from Sen. Brad Zaun, who was presiding.\nAt another point, a Democratic senator objected to Sinclair repeatedly referring to their talking points as \u201clies.\u201d\n\u201cI would love to not use the word \u2018lie,\u2019\u201d Sinclair responded, to derisive laughter from the opposite side of the chamber.\nLater, Zaun threatened to remove anyone causing a disturbance in the public gallery.\nIn the House, Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hampton, said he was impressed with the camaraderie shown by the representatives. Even so, Rep. Jeff Cooling, D-Cedar Rapids, drew an objection when he suggested on the House floor that the session was a result of special interests.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because special interests, some would say, are running the state and controlling the governor, some would say that. So this special interest session\u2026,\u201d Cooling said before a point of order was called.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s my belief that our time here today is neither fiscally responsible to the taxpayer, nor will the result of what we do here today lead to responsible government,\u201d Cooling continued. \u201cI believe that this session is all about power and politics, and I believe I was elected to represent people, not special interests.\u201d\n Lawmakers get personal\n\nLawmakers of both parties brought their personal stories to the debate.\u00a0\nRep. Luana Stoltenberg, R-Davenport, said she was standing up for mothers who have died or are infertile as a result of an abortion.\n  State Rep. Luana Stoltenberg is a Republican from Davenport. (Photo courtesy of the Iowa Legislature)\n\u201cI\u2019d like to speak up for my three children who lost their life and died by abortion,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak up for the 65 million plus other children that died by abortion and will never get to speak. I\u2019d like to speak up for the women who have been hurt by abortion and are too ashamed and too filled with guilt to be able to speak.\n\u201cI was told that it was just a blob of tissue, that it was easy and it was safe. That was a lie. Those abortions caused me not to be able to have children. Every day I live with the reality that I killed the only children I would ever have,\u201d she said.\nStoltenberg said uterine damage and infertility can happen as a result of abortions and shared stories of other mothers who have been harmed by abortions. \u201cWe do not have a constitutional right in the state of Iowa to kill our children,\u201d she concluded.\nWeiner, arguing that exceptions should be expanded to include mental health conditions, said she is raising her 5-year-old grandchild because her daughter has a mental health condition.\n\u201cShe\u2019s an addict, and she has serious mental health challenges and diagnosis so the irony is that right now under this bill, based on her addiction, based on her purposely and knowingly ingesting or injecting something, she would have a choice. Based on the mental health challenges that most likely led to and exacerbated her addiction, she would not have a choice,\u201d Weiner said.\nSenate Minority Leader Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque, whose late daughter had developmental disabilities, offered an amendment seeking to expand the exceptions under the bill to pregnant patients with a developmental disability. She said sexual abuse victims with developmental disabilities are taught to trust their abusers.\n\u201cThat was one of my biggest fears as a mom \u2013 biggest fear \u2014 that so many of the adults with disabilities are such trusting people,\u201d Jochum said. \u201cAnd no, they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. And yes, we have a duty to protect them.\u201d\nSinclair said because people with severe developmental disabilities are unable to consent to sex, they would be covered under the exception for rape. But Jochum said that was a \u201cflimsy excuse.\u201d\nShe said the abuse is unlikely to be reported. \u201cIf you can\u2019t consent, how can you report?\u201d\nOne Republican, Sen. Carrie Koelker of Dyersville, voted in favor of the amendment, which failed on a vote of 17-32.\n What\u2019s the penalty?\n\nThe bill specifies that women who obtain an abortion in violation of the law would face no civil or criminal penalties. But lawmakers in both chambers argued over whether the bill was clear or vague and what might happen to doctors who violate the law.\n  Hundreds of Iowans rallied for and against abortion restrictions on July 11, 2023 in the Capitol rotunda. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\nBaeth said, as a doctor, he does not know where to draw the line on the definition of \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d The law is not specific enough to give doctors confidence they will be free from punishment from the Board of Medicine, he said.\nBaeth said he was worried a patient would have to be already in critical condition to receive an abortion, because doctors are concerned they will break the law if they provide care too soon.\u00a0\n\u201cI have great concerns that the current exceptions are actually extremely narrow and strict because they only apply to somebody in whom because of pregnancy they would develop potentially, and quickly,\u201d Baeth said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical illness and death, actually they must be in critical illness and near death to receive those services.\u201d\nThe bill states the Board of Medicine is directed to adopt administrative rules to administer the bill. Normally, administrative rules have to be enacted within 90 days after a bill is signed into law. Since the bill is effective immediately upon enactment, rules are not yet established.\u00a0\nRep. Brian Meyer, D-Des Moines, asked Lundgren multiple times how the bill will be enforced, considering its quick passage.\nIn multiple instances, Lundgren was asked what would happen to a doctor if the law is violated.\u00a0\nLundgren responded each time that \u201cthe Board of Medicine will determine those rules,\u201d providing no more information to the body.\nIn the Senate, Sinclair said repeatedly she could not predict what rules the board would enact, but said she believes the bill text is clear enough that rules may not be needed. \u201cRules are not necessary for this bill to go into effect,\u201d she said.\nRep. John Forbes, D-Urbandale, a pharmacist, said the Board of Medicine will have a hard time creating rules.\u00a0\n\u201cI think they\u2019re [the Board of Medicine] going to have a difficult time interpreting really what type of action should be taken if a physician does make a mistake and not make the right decision he thinks is proper for that patient,\u201d Forbes said.\n Iowans pack the Capitol\n\n  Hundreds of Iowans rally in the Iowa Capitol rotunda July 11, 2023 during a special legislative session on abortion. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\nHundreds of Iowans packed the State Capitol on Tuesday to express their views on the legislation.\nThe Iowa House Health and Human Services Committee hosted a public hearing on House Study Bill 255 and the Senate State Government Committee heard public comments during a subcommittee meeting on its identical version of the bill, Senate Study Bill 1223.\nAs hearings were underway in two meeting rooms, hundreds gathered in the Capitol rotunda with signs and participated in chants, muffling the voices of those speaking inside. Chants of \u201cVote them out\u201d and \u201cHey hey, ho ho, abortion bans have got to go\u201d rang in the halls outside of the room.\u00a0\nRepublican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy joined the crowd after meeting with Reynolds.\n  GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, right, chats with pro-choice Iowan Lori Van Lo of West Des Moines on July 11, 2023 at the Capitol outside the Iowa House\u2019s public hearing on abortion. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\n\u201cThe judicial branch here got it wrong but the people of this country \u2013 people of this state \u2013 put Kim Reynolds in office and put those legislators in both chambers of the Legislature to actually reflect the will of the people. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re celebrating,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\u00a0Lori Van Lo of West Des Moines, who was standing nearby, interjected that 60% of Iowans don\u2019t agree with an abortion ban.\n\u201cSo, look, if you want to vote for somebody else, you have the power to do that,\u201d Ramaswamy responded.\nDuring both hearings, advocates from both sides of the issue shared their stories, citing religion, bodily autonomy and clarity of the bill\u2019s enforcement.\u00a0\nMaggie DeWitte, executive director of Pulse Life Advocates, said during the House hearing that she testified in front of legislators to prevent abortions in 2018.\u00a0\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming,\u201d DeWitte said. \u201cI testified at our heartbeat bill in 2018, and here we are again. It is beyond time to once and for all have this heartbeat law passed, for the second time, signed into law for the second time, but now will be able to be enforced.\u201d\nAdvocates that have spoken out against the passing of this bill have threatened to take the law to court if enacted.\u00a0\nFrancesca Turner, a doctor of osteopathic medicine, asked lawmakers for better guidance from the bill.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cUsing medically inaccurate language is confusing and dangerous,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThe words in the bill should be very specific and accurate. These words matter and facts are important.\u201d\nTurner asked the committee members: \u201cAt what point will your wife or your daughter, who is having a medical emergency related to pregnancy, do I get to save her life? At what point do I get to intervene? It is unclear in this bill.\u201d\n\u201cPregnancy is too complicated to legislate,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI support the rights of patients to choose medical care that is best for them, and help them access care without government interference.\u201d\nSpeakers cite religion\n  Pastor Michael Shover of Christ the Redeemer Church in Pella reads his Bible outside a public hearing on abortion in the state Capitol on July 11, 2023. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\nA majority of speakers in favor of the bill referred to their religion. John Lamb, a pastor speaking for Lutheran Family Service, emphasized during the Senate hearing that he believes life begins at conception. \u201cA new and unique human being comes into existence,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 So I want to remind everyone that when we talk about heartbeat, we\u2019re not talking about the heartbeat of something, but the heartbeat of someone.\u201d\n\u00a0Some who opposed the bill also cited their religion.\u00a0\nSally Frank, who said she was an active member of the Jewish community, said that the law does not allow her to practice religion.\u00a0\n\u201cUnder Jewish life, human life begins at birth. While the fetus has value, its value is far below the human lives of the living people, including those who are pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion is part of good health care and forced birth is not,\u201d Frank said.\nRev. Brigit Stevens, a regional minister for the United Church of Christ, spoke on behalf of Black, indigenous people of color and LGBTQ Iowans.\u00a0\n\u201cAbortion will not go away, it will go underground, and let\u2019s be frank, straight white men with money will still be able to get abortions for their wives, their daughters and their girlfriends,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd other people of color, Black, indigenous folks and LGBTQ Iowans will continue to die at exponentially higher rates than white Iowans. Mothers will die and babies will die.\u201d\nLoras College student Grace Van Petten said she used to be pro-choice and she now believes women her age are misinformed about abortion. \u201cWe have many young women like my younger self convinced that abortion is needed or necessary,\u201d she said, and that abortion is \u201cthe removal of just a clump of cells.\u201d\nHouse Democrats presented four amendments in committee regarding extending postpartum Medicaid, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and access to contraception and accessibility to child care. They all failed on party-line votes. Both bills passed their respective committees on party-line votes.\nBoth the House and Senate majority parties passed rules for the special session that limited debate in committees and on the floor. House leadership planned to halt debate at 10 p.m. and move immediately to a vote. The Senate\u2019s debate was set to end at 11 p.m.\nDemocrats in the House and Senate objected to limiting debate on the legislation.\n\u201cWhen you make a decision, Senator Whitver, to change the rules and democracy, to cut and muzzle the voices of Iowa women and those who love them and stand for them, you\u2019re showing what Iowa looks like. That\u2019s a dictatorship,\u201d Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said, addressing Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver during debate of chamber rules for the special session.\nSinclair pushed back at the criticism that the process has been rushed, saying during the subcommittee meeting the language was identical to the legislation debated at length and passed in 2018. \u201cWe are not here for one day, we are here for five years,\u201d she said during opening comments of the Senate\u2019s subcommittee meeting on the bill. \u201cIn fact, I would suggest that perhaps this has gone on too long, given the nature of the contents of the law.\u201d\n \n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the bill\nThe 2018 bill made most abortions after six weeks illegal. Under current law, abortions up to 20 weeks are legal in Iowa.\nMedical professionals would be mandated to check for a \u201cdetectable fetal heartbeat\u201d under the proposed bill, and then must inform the pregnant woman that an abortion is prohibited if embryonic cardiac activity is detected. The woman then must sign the document confirming her ineligibility for an abortion.\nThe bill allows exceptions for abortions after detected embryonic cardiac activity in a case of rape if the case was reported to law enforcement or a health agency within 45 days and within 140 days for cases of incest.\nThe only way to receive an abortion after the 20-week mark is if a physician determines there is a medical emergency.\nThe bill defines a medical emergency as \u201ca situation in which an abortion is performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy, but not including psychological conditions, emotional conditions, familial conditions or the woman\u2019s age; or when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairments of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\u201d\nLiability for an abortion does not fall on the mother, according to the proposed bill.\n\u201cThe bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division. The board of medicine is directed to adopt administrative rules to administer the bill.\u201d\nThe legislation takes effect immediately upon enactment by the governor\u2019s signature, which means rules to administer the bill would not yet be established.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIowa Legislature passes legislation to outlaw most abortions after six weeks\nby Jay Waagmeester, Iowa Capital Dispatch July 11, 2023\nIowa Legislature passes legislation to outlaw most abortions after six weeks\nby Jay Waagmeester, Iowa Capital Dispatch July 11, 2023\n The Republican-controlled Iowa Legislature, in a daylong special legislative session, passed legislation late Tuesday to outlaw most abortions in Iowa after six weeks of gestation.\nThe House adjourned just after 9 p.m. Tuesday after sending House File 732 to the Senate with a vote of 56-34.

Carrie Koelker of Dyersville, voted in favor of the amendment, which failed on a vote of 17-32.\n    What\u2019s the penalty?\n\n\t\nThe bill specifies that women who obtain an abortion in violation of the law would face no civil or criminal penalties. But lawmakers in both chambers argued over whether the bill was clear or vague and what might happen to doctors who violate the law.\n  Hundreds of Iowans rallied for and against abortion restrictions on July 11, 2023 in the Capitol rotunda. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\nBaeth said, as a doctor, he does not know where to draw the line on the definition of \u201cmedical emergency.\u201d The law is not specific enough to give doctors confidence they will be free from punishment from the Board of Medicine, he said.\nBaeth said he was worried a patient would have to be already in critical condition to receive an abortion, because doctors are concerned they will break the law if they provide care too soon.\u00a0\n\u201cI have great concerns that the current exceptions are actually extremely narrow and strict because they only apply to somebody in whom because of pregnancy they would develop potentially, and quickly,\u201d Baeth said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical illness and death, actually they must be in critical illness and near death to receive those services.\u201d\nThe bill states the Board of Medicine is directed to adopt administrative rules to administer the bill. Normally, administrative rules have to be enacted within 90 days after a bill is signed into law. Since the bill is effective immediately upon enactment, rules are not yet established.\u00a0\nRep. Brian Meyer, D-Des Moines, asked Lundgren multiple times how the bill will be enforced, considering its quick passage.\nIn multiple instances, Lundgren was asked what would happen to a doctor if the law is violated.\u00a0\nLundgren responded each time that \u201cthe Board of Medicine will determine those rules,\u201d providing no more information to the body.\nIn the Senate, Sinclair said repeatedly she could not predict what rules the board would enact, but said she believes the bill text is clear enough that rules may not be needed. \u201cRules are not necessary for this bill to go into effect,\u201d she said.\nRep. John Forbes, D-Urbandale, a pharmacist, said the Board of Medicine will have a hard time creating rules.\u00a0\n\u201cI think they\u2019re [the Board of Medicine] going to have a difficult time interpreting really what type of action should be taken if a physician does make a mistake and not make the right decision he thinks is proper for that patient,\u201d Forbes said.\n    Iowans pack the Capitol\n\n\t\n  Hundreds of Iowans rally in the Iowa Capitol rotunda July 11, 2023 during a special legislative session on abortion. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\nHundreds of Iowans packed the State Capitol on Tuesday to express their views on the legislation.\nThe Iowa House Health and Human Services Committee hosted a public hearing on House Study Bill 255 and the Senate State Government Committee heard public comments during a subcommittee meeting on its identical version of the bill, Senate Study Bill 1223.\nAs hearings were underway in two meeting rooms, hundreds gathered in the Capitol rotunda with signs and participated in chants, muffling the voices of those speaking inside. Chants of \u201cVote them out\u201d and \u201cHey hey, ho ho, abortion bans have got to go\u201d rang in the halls outside of the room.\u00a0\nRepublican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy joined the crowd after meeting with Reynolds.\n  GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, right, chats with pro-choice Iowan Lori Van Lo of West Des Moines on July 11, 2023 at the Capitol outside the Iowa House\u2019s public hearing on abortion. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\n\u201cThe judicial branch here got it wrong but the people of this country \u2013 people of this state \u2013 put Kim Reynolds in office and put those legislators in both chambers of the Legislature to actually reflect the will of the people. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re celebrating,\u201d Ramaswamy said.\n\u00a0Lori Van Lo of West Des Moines, who was standing nearby, interjected that 60% of Iowans don\u2019t agree with an abortion ban.\n\u201cSo, look, if you want to vote for somebody else, you have the power to do that,\u201d Ramaswamy responded.\nDuring both hearings, advocates from both sides of the issue shared their stories, citing religion, bodily autonomy and clarity of the bill\u2019s enforcement.\u00a0\nMaggie DeWitte, executive director of Pulse Life Advocates, said during the House hearing that she testified in front of legislators to prevent abortions in 2018.\u00a0\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming,\u201d DeWitte said. \u201cI testified at our heartbeat bill in 2018, and here we are again. It is beyond time to once and for all have this heartbeat law passed, for the second time, signed into law for the second time, but now will be able to be enforced.\u201d\nAdvocates that have spoken out against the passing of this bill have threatened to take the law to court if enacted.\u00a0\nFrancesca Turner, a doctor of osteopathic medicine, asked lawmakers for better guidance from the bill.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cUsing medically inaccurate language is confusing and dangerous,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThe words in the bill should be very specific and accurate. These words matter and facts are important.\u201d\nTurner asked the committee members: \u201cAt what point will your wife or your daughter, who is having a medical emergency related to pregnancy, do I get to save her life? At what point do I get to intervene? It is unclear in this bill.\u201d\n\u201cPregnancy is too complicated to legislate,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI support the rights of patients to choose medical care that is best for them, and help them access care without government interference.\u201d\n    Speakers cite religion\n\n\t\n  Pastor Michael Shover of Christ the Redeemer Church in Pella reads his Bible outside a public hearing on abortion in the state Capitol on July 11, 2023. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)\nA majority of speakers in favor of the bill referred to their religion. John Lamb, a pastor speaking for Lutheran Family Service, emphasized during the Senate hearing that he believes life begins at conception. \u201cA new and unique human being comes into existence,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 So I want to remind everyone that when we talk about heartbeat, we\u2019re not talking about the heartbeat of something, but the heartbeat of someone.\u201d\n\u00a0Some who opposed the bill also cited their religion.\u00a0\nSally Frank, who said she was an active member of the Jewish community, said that the law does not allow her to practice religion.\u00a0\n\u201cUnder Jewish life, human life begins at birth. While the fetus has value, its value is far below the human lives of the living people, including those who are pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cAbortion is part of good health care and forced birth is not,\u201d Frank said.\nRev. Brigit Stevens, a regional minister for the United Church of Christ, spoke on behalf of Black, indigenous people of color and LGBTQ Iowans.\u00a0\n\u201cAbortion will not go away, it will go underground, and let\u2019s be frank, straight white men with money will still be able to get abortions for their wives, their daughters and their girlfriends,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd other people of color, Black, indigenous folks and LGBTQ Iowans will continue to die at exponentially higher rates than white Iowans. Mothers will die and babies will die.\u201d\nLoras College student Grace Van Petten said she used to be pro-choice and she now believes women her age are misinformed about abortion. \u201cWe have many young women like my younger self convinced that abortion is needed or necessary,\u201d she said, and that abortion is \u201cthe removal of just a clump of cells.\u201d\nHouse Democrats presented four amendments in committee regarding extending postpartum Medicaid, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and access to contraception and accessibility to child care. They all failed on party-line votes. Both bills passed their respective committees on party-line votes.\nBoth the House and Senate majority parties passed rules for the special session that limited debate in committees and on the floor. House leadership planned to halt debate at 10 p.m. and move immediately to a vote. The Senate\u2019s debate was set to end at 11 p.m.\nDemocrats in the House and Senate objected to limiting debate on the legislation.\n\u201cWhen you make a decision, Senator Whitver, to change the rules and democracy, to cut and muzzle the voices of Iowa women and those who love them and stand for them, you\u2019re showing what Iowa looks like. That\u2019s a dictatorship,\u201d Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said, addressing Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver during debate of chamber rules for the special session.\nSinclair pushed back at the criticism that the process has been rushed, saying during the subcommittee meeting the language was identical to the legislation debated at length and passed in 2018. \u201cWe are not here for one day, we are here for five years,\u201d she said during opening comments of the Senate\u2019s subcommittee meeting on the bill. \u201cIn fact, I would suggest that perhaps this has gone on too long, given the nature of the contents of the law.\u201d\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat\u2019s in the bill\nThe 2018 bill made most abortions after six weeks illegal. Under current law, abortions up to 20 weeks are legal in Iowa.\nMedical professionals would be mandated to check for a \u201cdetectable fetal heartbeat\u201d under the proposed bill, and then must inform the pregnant woman that an abortion is prohibited if embryonic cardiac activity is detected. The woman then must sign the document confirming her ineligibility for an abortion.\nThe bill allows exceptions for abortions after detected embryonic cardiac activity in a case of rape if the case was reported to law enforcement or a health agency within 45 days and within 140 days for cases of incest.\nThe only way to receive an abortion after the 20-week mark is if a physician determines there is a medical emergency.\nThe bill defines a medical emergency as \u201ca situation in which an abortion is performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy, but not including psychological conditions, emotional conditions, familial conditions or the woman\u2019s age; or when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairments of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\u201d\nLiability for an abortion does not fall on the mother, according to the proposed bill.\n\u201cThe bill is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division. The board of medicine is directed to adopt administrative rules to administer the bill.\u201d\nThe legislation takes effect immediately upon enactment by the governor\u2019s signature, which means rules to administer the bill would not yet be established.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIowa Capital Dispatch is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
