Wade that legalized the practice nearly 50 years ago.Conservative religious groups organized Tuesday's event, dubbed \"Abolition Day,\" and attendees sang, held signs and listened to speakers and videos before heading into the Capitol to talk with state lawmakers.\u201cYou can't have bills that end in any way with \u2018and then you can kill the baby,\u2019\u201d said Leslie Hanks, who drove in from Colorado and considers herself an abolitionist rather than a pro-life advocate. \u201cThat is moral insanity. It is double-mindedness. The secular pro-life movement is not getting the job done.\u201dAmy Kelly, who attended the rally with her Tecumseh-based church, said she believes the dialogue around abortion needs to focus on \u201cbreaking down barriers.\u201d\u201cIf you are having problems \u2026 and abortion is something you are thinking about, look at these people here willing to hold your hand,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe want to say \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t have to go through this alone.\u2019\u201dSen. Joseph Silk, R-Broken Bow, authored the bill and attended the rally. He told the crowd there was still work to be done but he was encouraged by the support.A separate, smaller, pro-choice rally was organized in opposition to Abolition Day, which similarly had signs, a speaker and a mission to speak with lawmakers.There were times of tension between the two groups throughout the morning, and state troopers were brought in as extra security.Susan Braselton, one of the pro-choice rally organizers and a coordinator of Clinic Escorts in Tulsa, said any push for Oklahoma to ignore an established court decision or deny a woman's right to choose is a problem.\u201cI don\u2019t trust my legislators to do the right thing,\u201d Braselton said. \u201cI want them to know that there are other people who have other opinions besides those loud people up there.\"Silk introduced the same legislation last year, but it was never heard in committee. Without the support of Senate leadership, the bill faces parallel challenges this year.Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat said he agrees with abolishing abortion, but that SB 13 is \"fatally flawed.\"\"I am absolutely committed to challenging the current precedent, but I want to do it in such a way that it's consistent with the U.S. Constitution, and I believe that SB 13 is much more focused on quasi-secession rather than saving human lives,\" Treat, R-Oklahoma City, previously told The Oklahoman.The bill has not been scheduled to be heard in committee during the 2020 session.House Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, recently pointed to the state's infant and maternal mortality rate, saying it \"doesn't really reflect that pro-life attitude\" promoted by many.\"The difference between being pro-life and pro-birth is how do you treat those mothers once those babies are born?\" Bennett said. \"And in Oklahoma, we've got a lot of work to do.\"Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.oklahoman.com.
