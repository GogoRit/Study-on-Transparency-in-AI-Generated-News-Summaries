Girls and young women are disproportionately affected by and vulnerable to SRHR violations \u2013 particularly during adolescence. Each year, millions are forced into early marriage or unions, bearing children too young, and being subjected to sexual violence. A chronic failure to treat adolescents as a unique group with specifi c needs is compounding this vulnerability \u2013 as the statistics confirm.\nApproximately 16 million adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 and 2.5 million girls aged 12 to 15 give birth each year\u00a0\u2013 nine in ten births by adolescents occur within marriage or a union.Every day, an average of 33,000 girls are forced into child marriage.Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for 15- to 19-year-old girls globally,\u00a0and three in five of all maternal deaths take place in humanitarian and fragile contexts.3.2 million adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 in low income countries undergo unsafe abortions each year.\nOur goal is for children, adolescents and young people in all their diversity to have control of their lives and bodies, and make decisions about their sexuality, free from discrimination, coercion or violence. This includes whether, when and with whom to have sex, marry and have a child.\nDownload options\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\npdf\n\n8.69 mb \n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSexual and reproductive health and rights, child marriage, Child protection in emergencies, Female genital mutilation, Maternal health, Teenage pregnancy\t\t\t\t\n\nRelated pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShamirah: I want to see a future without stigma and discrimination\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShamirah campaigns for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of young women living with HIV.
