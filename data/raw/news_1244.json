Photo by Isiah Holmes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin\u2019s 172-year-old abortion ban, which doesn\u2019t include exceptions for rape or incest, proved to be an influential force in this month\u2019s elections. With uncertainty about the future of abortion hanging over Wisconsin ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federally protected abortion rights in June, Democrats galvanized women and young voters on the message of improving access. Some Republican candidates were firm about enforcing Wisconsin\u2019s 19th century ban, while others treaded lightly, saying they would support additional exceptions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe reelection of Democrats Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul as well as Republicans\u2019 failure to secure a veto-proof legislative supermajority leaves Wisconsin in about the same position it was in before the election. Democrats are pursuing action through the courts while Republicans discuss the possibility of new abortion legislation.\u00a0\n\u201cIf [GOP candidate] Tim Michels had been elected as governor and if [Republican] Eric Toney had been elected as the attorney general for the state, a new law would have likely been passed, there\u2019d be prosecution. The landscape moving forward would look very different,\u201d said Michelle Velasquez, director of legal advocacy with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. \u201cWith Kaul and Evers\u2019 reelection, we\u2019re really able to just stay the course.\u201d\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin stopped providing abortion services immediately following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0decision. Under Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban, providers could be prosecuted as felons if they continued to offer abortion services. The organization now helps people seeking the procedure find care in other states, and offers follow-up services.\nIn the days following the Dobbs decision, Kaul filed a lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court asking the court to provide clarity on state abortion law by declaring the 1849 ban unenforceable due to its conflict with statutes enacted after it.\u00a0\n\u201cWisconsin has an entire other regulatory scheme \u2014 abortion restrictions and things that make it difficult to access care \u2014 that have been on the books and have been added to even quite recently,\u201d says Mel Barnes, staff counsel at Law Forward. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that these more recent laws supersede the state\u2019s 19th century abortion ban and render it invalid. Some of the more recent regulations include restrictions that require physicians rather than nurses or midwives to perform\u00a0 abortions, parental consent requirements for minors, a ban on abortions after 20 weeks and the requirement that patients receive state-mandated informations.\u00a0\nThe lawsuit is pending and parties in the case have changed several times since it was filed during the summer.\u00a0\nThe current defendants in the case are district attorneys in three counties where Planned Parenthood previously provided abortion services: Sheboygan County DA Joel Urmanski, Dane County DA Ismael Ozanne and Milwaukee County DA John Chisholm. Kaul first filed the case against Republican legislative leaders including Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, Senate President Chris Kapenga and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, however, they were dismissed after arguing that legislators are not the parties who would enforce the law and Kaul amended the lawsuit to include the district attorneys.\nThree physicians were granted motions on Friday to intervene in the case, essentially adding them as parties. Barnes says physicians have a clear, vested interest in the case since they were the only ones permitted to practice the procedure in Wisconsin and could face prosecution under the 1849 ban.\u00a0\nBarnes says the addition of the physicians will provide a fuller understanding of the case to the court.\u00a0\n\u201cHaving those voices before the court as part of this lawsuit offers an opportunity for the Court to hear more about the realities of this care and patients\u2019 lives, and what enforcing this law and criminalizing these doctors would mean in our state,\u201d Barnes says.\nEvers and Kaul have committed to not pursuing prosecution against physicians performing abortions. According to Velasquez, that\u2019s not sufficient reassurance for physicians.\nDistrict attorneys are tasked with enforcing the law throughout the state. Some DAs have said they would enforce the abortion ban while others say they will not.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some district attorneys say they would not invest resources into investigating and criminalizing abortion under the 1849 law,\u201d Velasquez says. \u201cBut there are also district attorneys who have made their position very public, in that they believe that law sort of automatically sprung back to life upon the overturning of Roe.\u201d\nThe intervention of the physicians could also potentially provide the lawsuit with a secondary life if Kaul were removed, according to Velasquez.\u00a0\n\u201cIf a court were to determine that the attorney general doesn\u2019t have standing to even bring this lawsuit because his office isn\u2019t an office that could be sued under this lawsuit,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cThen those physicians \u2014 if they\u2019re granted permission to join \u2014 their case would still stand.\u201d\u00a0\nEvers supports Kaul\u2019s lawsuit and says he\u2019s confident it will be successful.\u00a0\nAt a press conference the day after his reelection, Evers reiterated his position and cast doubt on the prospects for resolving the ambiguity in Wisconsin\u2019s abortion laws legislatively.\n\u201cIf the Legislature wants to put a proposal up, I\u2019ll certainly look at it, but just listening to the comments during the campaign, I don\u2019t think it exists,\u201d Evers said. \u201cWe are going to continue pursuing that lawsuit. There\u2019s no question, and I think we can win that lawsuit.\u201d\nRepublican legislative leaders have recently taken a different tone, hinting that discussion of a bill is not out of the question for the coming session.\u00a0\nSenate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said in an interview with WKOW that Republicans need to continue to protect life starting from the moment of conception, and his caucus will need to look into the potential for legislation. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in the days following the elections called on Republicans to pass a bill that would amend the ban to include exceptions for rape and incest and said he doesn\u2019t believe this should be solved through Wisconsin\u2019s courts.\u00a0\n\u201cI heard an awful lot of arguing and complaining over the course of the past four years that we shouldn\u2019t run to court to make public policy, that\u2019s what the Legislature and the governor are supposed to do,\u201d Vos told reporters.\nEvers called a special session after the Dobbs decision asking the Legislature to consider a repeal of the 1849 ban. Republicans gaveled in and out of the session without discussion. Evers called another special session in September asking the Legislature to consider passing a constitutional amendment that would have created a path for voters to decide the question. Republicans, again, gaveled in and out.\nThe passage of a bill with exceptions, according to Velasquez, would be a way of solidifying Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban.\n\u201cThe potential for an additional exception for rape and incest would be really a manuever used to essentially kill the lawsuit,\u201d Velasquez said. She said if a bill passing amendments to the 1849 ban became law, it would essentially validate the law and there would no longer be need for a court to clarify the law.\u00a0\nAdding narrow exceptions to the law would not only invalidate the lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban, it would solidify much restricted access to abortion in Wisconsin in the post-Dobbs era.\u00a0\nVos said in a later interview on conservative talk radio that he would be willing to require rape or incest victims to produced a police report in order to qualify for a legal abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know that many sexual assault perpetrators are people that the victim knows and that can be one of the reasons that people don\u2019t report to law enforcement,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cWhat Vos has proposed is not a solution, and it\u2019s not a compromise, and it is not what the women of Wisconsin deserve.\u201d\nAccording to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, the majority of rape cases \u2014 two out of three \u2014 are not reported to the police. Some reasons for not reporting include the belief that police would not or could not do anything to help.\nSenate Minority Leader Melissa Agard (D-Madison) criticized Vos\u2019 comments and said the proposal would be a cruel and unusual punishment for victims who become pregnant.\u00a0\n\u201cWe do know that the overwhelming number of sexual assaults that occur are not reported, and forcing a person who has experienced sexual assault or rape or incest to report that trauma when they\u2019re not ready to be able to face this flies in the face of all evidence-based policy making,\u201d Agard said.\nAssembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer said her caucus will continue to work to restore access to abortion, and they\u2019re open to serious discussion. However, she cast doubt on Republicans\u2019 seriousness.\u00a0\n\u201cThus far [Republicans] have chosen not to show up to special sessions, but we\u2019re always open to conversations about policy that benefits Wisconsinites,\u201d Neubauer said on WISN.\nThe Legislature will return to session in January. Meanwhile it is too early to pinpoint when a decision could come from the courts.\nA briefing schedule has yet to be set establishing\u00a0 when written arguments from each party need to be submitted to the court.\u00a0\nBarnes adds that a future decision may not be the end of legal action over the 1849 ban.\n\u201cThere are always potential appeals, no matter who wins or loses. It\u2019s always possible that the side that loses could appeal, which would mean that the case could go to the court of appeals, or on to higher courts,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cThat timeline factor is just pretty impossible to know at this point.\u201d\nA judgment from the courts declaring the ban unenforceable would likely not be the end of debate about abortion in Wisconsin either. A decision in favor of Kaul would revert Wisconsin law back to its state pre-Dobbs \u2014 an environment where abortion was already difficult to obtain.\n\u201cCare would still be incredibly restricted and difficult to access in our state,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cWhat we really need to do in order to fully protect the freedoms of people in Wisconsin and make sure that they have that freedom to access the health care that they need, is not just return to the status quo, but also repeal these other restrictions that are unnecessary, not based in science and make care so difficult to access.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXTwo paths forward on Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban\nby Baylor Spears, Wisconsin Examiner November 21, 2022\nTwo paths forward on Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban\nby Baylor Spears, Wisconsin Examiner November 21, 2022\n Wisconsin\u2019s 172-year-old abortion ban, which doesn\u2019t include exceptions for rape or incest, proved to be an influential force in this month\u2019s elections.
