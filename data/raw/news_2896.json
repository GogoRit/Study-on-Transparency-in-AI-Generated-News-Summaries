Most people here are unsurprised that the reactionary law-making body (made up of 82 Republicans and 19 Democrats) would move to outlaw abortion. Some people were, however, caught off guard by the suddenness of the move, which came unannounced while pro-choice demonstrators gathered outside the capitol in Oklahoma City.\nThe \u201cBans Off Oklahoma\u201d rally was organized by Planned Parenthood and other allies supportive of reproductive rights. It appears that Republican legislators intentionally timed the bill\u2019s passage as an \u201cin your face\u201d gesture to those rallying outside. The bill was passed overwhelmingly, by a vote of 70 to 14.\nThis bill would subject anyone who performs an abortion to up to 10 years in prison and up to $100,000 in fines. It is one of the most extreme anti-abortion bills passed so far, effectively criminalizing abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with the only exception being \u201cto save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency.\u201d There is otherwise no exception for the health of the patient, and there is no exception for rape.\nExtreme-right Gov. Kevin Stitt has promised to sign any anti-abortion legislation that reaches his desk. Stitt has declared himself the \u201cmost pro-life\u201d governor in state history. \u201cPro-life,\u201d for the governor, does not extend to opposing capital punishment, however, as he has been busy reviving the state\u2019s death row machinery.\nOklahoma rivals Texas as a leading executioner in the nation, but prior to this year, the state had not executed anyone since 2014, when a botched execution left Clayton Lockett writhing in pain, before finally succumbing to a heart attack, in what many described as de facto \u201ctorture.\u201d\nNor does Stitt\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d posture extend to public health measures to protect Oklahomans from COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, he adamantly opposed health regulations, leading to Oklahoma having the highest coronavirus death rate of any state in the nation in 2021.\nOklahoma has been referred to as the \u201cbuckle of the Bible Belt,\u201d and religious fundamentalism is indeed stronger here than in most parts of the country, with 66% of Oklahomans identified as \u201chighly religious\u201d according to a study by the\u00a0Pew Research Center. Nevertheless, also according to Pew,\u00a051%\u00a0of Oklahomans are pro-choice\u2014they believe abortion should be \u201clegal in all/most cases\u201d.\nOne should not make the mistake of viewing this as an isolated piece of repression unique to this one state. It comes as part of a wave of anti-choice legislation sweeps in GOP-led states across the country, ahead of the likely overturn of Roe v. Wade\u00a0this summer. Indeed, neighboring Texas received national attention in passing its own abortion ban into law last September. According to the ACLU, nearly half of the patients currently seeking abortions in Oklahoma come from Texas.\nThe Texas law evades judicial review by placing enforcement in the hands of citizens empowered to sue others in civil court for receiving or performing abortions, thereby removing state officials and government bodies as targets from any potential legal challenges on constitutional grounds.\nOutrageously, the Supreme Court allowed the state to get away with this \u201cvigilante\u201d enforcement mechanism, potentially opening the floodgates for other states to enact similarly unconstitutional legislation using the same means. The Oklahoma law differs from the Texas law in that it does not include the same civil court means of enforcement, but rather imposes criminal penalties outright.\nThe new anti-choice law is certain to face legal challenges, as it is in clear violation of federal constitutional protections guaranteed by\u00a0Roe. Previous efforts such as this one have been overturned in the courts, but this time may be different, as it is widely anticipated that the current Supreme Court, packed with reactionaries by former President Donald Trump, will soon overturn that landmark 1973 ruling.\nIt remains to be seen how much of a boost such repressive rulings from SCOTUS will give to the already rising demands for reform of the nation\u2019s highest court, including calls to increase the number of justices, as well as possible term limits on the justices, who currently serve for life.\nMany also question what it says about the state of U.S. \u201cdemocracy\u201d that five of the nine current justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. George W. Bush, who made two appointments to the court, and Donald Trump, who made three, both became president while receiving fewer votes than their opponents, thanks to the nation\u2019s archaic Electoral College system, created as a concession to Southern slaveholding elites at the time of the nation\u2019s founding. (In fact, the twice-impeached, one-term president Trump not only never won the popular vote; he never polled majority approval for a single day during his entire term in office.)\nIt has been widely noted that, at least for the foreseeable future, the wealthy and privileged will still find the means to exercise control over their reproductive choice. It is generally assumed that states with Democratic majorities will continue to allow women to exercise their right to decide whether to bring a pregnancy to term, and those with the means will simply take a vacation, but many working-class and poor people may not have that option.\nAlso, it may be ill-advised to assume that such reactionary legislation will be restricted to red states. Certainly, the so-called \u201cpro-life\u201d forces will not be satisfied with only outlawing abortion in red states. They will likely advance their legal argument beyond merely the \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d and \u201coriginalist\u201d arguments being currently advanced and make the case that the fetus is entitled to \u201ccitizenship\u201d protections under the 14th Amendment. If the courts were to rule on 14th Amendment grounds, that would make abortion illegal nationwide. And, of course, another path to the same effect would be federal legislation to ban abortion in the case that the GOP were to retake the Congress and White House.\nThe real victims of all such reactionary legislation will be low-income and working-class Americans who cannot afford the exorbitant costs involved with traveling out of state for what is actually a very simple, safe medical procedure (which is, in fact, safer than giving birth). It must be viewed as part and parcel of the ongoing fascist and reactionary threats posed to the fragile democratic order by a two-party political system in which one of the two capitalist parties has turned fully against basic democracy and civil liberties, even to the extent of embracing violent insurrectionists, as recent events have shown.\nCPUSA.org\n\nTags: Abortion\nhealth\nOklahoma\nreproductive rights\nwomen\n\n \n\n\nCONTRIBUTOR\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Jansen\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Jansen is an activist writing from Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\nNational Women\u2019s Law Center links equal pay with abortion rights\n\n\n\nArchives 2020: People\u2019s World reports from inside Wuhan\n\n\n\nIWD: Around the world, women are on the march\n\n\n\n\nComments comments \n \n\n\nMOST POPULAR TODAY\n\n Trump: \u2018There will be a bloodbath and no more elections if I lose.\u2019 \n With ceasefire movement pressuring U.S. leaders, Netanyahu fears losing support \n Opera by British suffragist composer Dame Ethel Smyth in West Coast premiere \n Free college was once the norm all over America \n U.S. migration policy change eases border rules but hurts Cuba \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nAbout People\u2019s World\nContact\nPolitical Affairs Archive\nMundo Popular Archive\nDownload Print Edition\n Copyright 2024.
