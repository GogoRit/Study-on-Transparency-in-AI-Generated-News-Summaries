Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. FIRST ON FOX: Valerie Biden Owens, President Biden's younger sister, argues that Democrats are more \"pro-life\" than Republicans on abortion in her upcoming memoir.    Owens, a longtime campaign adviser and political confidante to Biden, will be\u00a0releasing her memoir\u00a0titled, \"Growing Up Biden: A Memoir\" on Tuesday. Fox News Digital received a copy of the book Monday afternoon.\u00a0Within the memoir, Owens writes that Democrats picked the wrong term for their abortion stance. Instead of wanting to be called \"pro-choice,\" she says they should have chosen to be the \"pro-life\" party because they are advocating for better lives for women.\u00a0  Valerie Biden, sister of Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, speaks to supporters at her bother's New Hampshire primary night rally in Nashua, New Hampshire U.S., Feb. 11, 2020. (Reuters/Carlos Barria)  \"Like many women, I harbored complicated feelings on the topic,\" Owens writes in the memoir. \"I'm pro-choice, but I remain convinced that Democrats chose the wrong term for our side of the issue.\"  \"We should have been pro-life, for we are the ones advocating for a better life, a life in which a mother gets to determine her future and that of her child,\" she writes. \"Sometimes, I even accidentally say I'm pro-life, because that's what it feels like the pro-choice position should have been called.\"  Owens' book tour was slated to kick off last Thursday in Washington, D.C., but it ended up being a virtual event after it was reported Owens tested positive for COVID-19.\u00a0Fox News Digital published a report on Owens last week about how the memoir raises some ethical questions about Owens cashing in on her brother's name and whether this conflicts with White House press secretary Jen Psaki\u2019s statement last January about the White House's ethics policy.  BIDEN INC.: BIDEN'S SISTER TO KEEP CASHING IN ON BROTHER'S CAREER WITH NEW MEMOIR, FOLLOWING FAMILY TRADITION  President Joe Biden embraces his family First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, son Hunter Biden and daughter Ashley after being sworn in during his inauguation on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2021 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\"It's the White House's policy that the president's name should not be used in connection with any commercial activities to suggest or in any way \u2014 in any way they could reasonably be understood to imply his endorsement or support,\" Psaki said.  The book includes a childhood photo of Owens, Joe Biden, their two brothers and their mother on the book cover and multiple chapters revolve around Biden. President Biden is also listed in the acknowledgments at the end of the book, thanking \"My brothers, Joe, Jim, and Frank, for supplying the raw material\" for her book.
