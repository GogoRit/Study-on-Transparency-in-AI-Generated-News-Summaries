On March 11, 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal nationwide, Hawaii passed historic legislation making it the first state in the country to allow safe, legal abortion care.\u00a0\n\u201cOn this day 50 years ago, Hawaii\u2019s lawmakers decided that Hawaii was going to lead the nation in advancing reproductive health and rights,\u201d said Laurie Field, Hawaii State Director at PPVNH. \u201cWe are proud of this significant milestone and we are continuing to build upon this important right, currently under threat. It is more important than ever given the national and state level attacks on abortion access to protect and advance our health, rights and freedoms here in Hawaii. The people of Hawaii do not want to lose access to a right they've worked so hard to maintain.\u201d\nTo celebrate this historic moment, PPVNH staff, volunteers, and youth will be at the Hawaii State Capitol for Lobby Day today raising awareness about the necessity for meaningful access to reproductive health care, including safe, legal abortion care across Hawaii. Recent polling conducted by Planned Parenthood shows that \u201c85 percent of Hawaii voters intensely believe it is important that women have access to all of the reproductive health care options available, including abortion.\u201d\nBy June, the Supreme Court will rule on June Medical Services, a case about a dangerous abortion restriction in Louisiana. This case is big: it could decide the future of abortion access in this country. Less than four years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that medically unnecessary laws like the one in Louisiana were unconstitutional. With 77 percent of people in this country supporting safe, legal abortion, the Supreme Court's decision has the potential to go against established precedent and the will of the people.\n\u201cLegal and safe abortion is meaningless if people don\u2019t have access to it,\u201d Field said. \u201cWe must preserve the spirit of our lawmakers from 50 years ago and continue pushing for innovative leadership and robust support for access to abortion. We must put our money where our mouth is, and close the gaps on access to abortion, in the name of our reputation as leaders in this country.\u201d\n\n\n# # #\n\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii (PPVNH) is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization educating residents and policy-makers about reproductive health issues in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, and Hawaii.
