Bob Corker of Tennessee.\nTo support the proposals, Corley formed a 501c4 non profit in June called Missouri Women and Family Research Fund.\u00a0\n\u201cThe current abortion law makes it dangerous to be a mom in Missouri, burdens taxpayers with litigation costs, puts law enforcement in a position to punish crime victims rather than protect them, and gives the government \u2014not parents\u2014 decision-making power over how to care for their child if she is impregnated because of rape,\u201d Corley said in a statement announcing the initiative petitions. \u201cThe abortion law in Missouri is too radical and cannot stand.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to the procedure, Missouri\u2019s trigger law went into effect banning virtually all abortions. There are no exemptions for rape or incest, and opaque language around protections medical emergencies have resulted in confusion in the state\u2019s medical community.\nDoctors who perform an abortion can face felony charges and loss of their medical license.\u00a0\nIn March, abortion-rights groups partnered to file 11 initiative petitions hoping to place a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot overturning Missouri\u2019s abortion ban. The proposed amendments would declare that the \u201cgovernment shall not infringe upon a person\u2019s fundamental right to reproductive freedom,\u201d including \u201cprenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care and respectful birthing conditions.\u201d\u00a0\nPenalties for both patients seeking reproductive-related care and medical providers would be outlawed.\nEach version of the proposed amendment says there must be a \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d for abortion restrictions to be put in place. But while some allow the legislature to regulate abortion after \u201cfetal viability,\u201d others draw the line at 24 weeks of gestation. Some versions make it clear the state can enact parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions. Others leave the topic out entirely.\nAll 11 initiative petitions are tied up in court, with proponents suing over what they\u2019ve deemed is a biased ballot summary written by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who is running for governor. Opponents have also sued, demanding the cost estimate be inflated to indicate lifting Missouri\u2019s abortion ban would cost the state billions.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood, who before the ban was the state\u2019s only abortion provider, opted not to participate in the initiative petition campaign because the proposals only protect abortion access before the fetus is viable or until 24 weeks of pregnancy. The organization also balked at parental consent requirements.\nCorley\u2019s six initiative petitions don\u2019t go nearly as far as the previously filed proposals.\u00a0\nAll versions enshrine \u201cexceptions and immunity\u201d clauses into Missouri\u2019s abortion law, and three versions include language prohibiting the government from interfering with a woman\u2019s access to an abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe rape exception would only apply to victims who have reported the rape or sexual assault to a crisis hotline.\u00a0\nEach version also states that the rights guaranteed in the amendment \u201care subject to strict scrutiny,\u201d meaning any restrictions to abortion enacted by the legislature must further a \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d and must be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\nAnyone seeking an abortion outside of Missouri could not be subject to criminal prosecution or civil penalty. The same immunity applies to health professionals or anyone assisting in seeking an abortion.\u00a0\nSome versions also contain provisions prohibiting use of taxpayer funds to be used \u201cin support of the provision of abortion in this state.\u201d However, in those versions legislature would not be permitted to cut off funding for health care providers who perform abortions.\u00a0\nA 12 week abortion ban would line up Missouri with some other Republican-leaning states, such as North Carolina and Nebraska. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 43% of all abortions occur in the first six weeks of pregnancy and 92% in the first 13 weeks.\nThe Missouri ACLU, which is defending the 11 initiative petitions in court, could be immediately reached for comment on Corley\u2019s proposals. Yamelsie Rodr\u00edguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said in an emailed statement that her organization has \u201calways advocated for abortion access that is just, equitable, and scientifically grounded \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t change today.\u00a0\n\u201cAs a health care provider \u2014 and the last abortion provider in the state \u2014 we know the consequences of abortion bans and restrictions: exceptions have never provided meaningful access,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cWhile some are proposing ballot measures that will continue to harm Missourians, we will continue to fight for the meaningful access that Missourians need.\u201d\nCorley did not offer specifics about who is involved in campaign, saying only that she is \u201cbuilding a broad coalition of Missourians who think the current abortion law is extreme and needs to be changed. Missourians deserve the opportunity to vote on an independent, rational \u2014 and passable \u2014 plan to restore legal but limited access to abortion in Missouri in 2024.\u201d\nBut she was assisted in drafting the language by Chuck Haftield, a longtime Jefferson City attorney who worked in the attorney general\u2019s office under Democrat Jay Nixon.\n\u201cThese initiatives are very straightforward,\u201d Hatfield said in an statement to The Independent. \u201cVoters should easily understand what they are being asked to vote on and the Secretary (of State) should be able to easily summarize the effects without controversy.\u201d\nMissouri law requires petitioners to collect more than 170,000 signatures by May 2024 in order to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot. Republicans lawmakers, most notably House Speaker Dan Plocher, have worked to make it harder to amend the constitution through the initiative petition process in an effort to short circuit any abortion-rights proposal from succeeding next year.\u00a0\n\u201cThe current abortion law makes Missouri look draconian, punitive and unsafe for families,\u201d Corley said. \u201cThe law runs afoul of public opinion and we look forward to building a broad coalition of Missourians who want, need and deserve the opportunity to change it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXNew initiative petitions seek to add rape, incest exceptions to Missouri abortion law\nby Jason Hancock, Missouri Independent August 30, 2023\nNew initiative petitions seek to add rape, incest exceptions to Missouri abortion law\nby Jason Hancock, Missouri Independent August 30, 2023\n Six new initiative petitions were filed with the Missouri Secretary of State\u2019s office Wednesday seeking to add exceptions to the state\u2019s abortion ban for rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities and the health and safety of the mother.\u00a0\nThree of the six initiative petitions would also legalize abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nEach was filed by Jamie Corley, a veteran GOP political operative from St. Louis who has worked for three members of Congress, including as national press secretary for former U.S. Sen.
