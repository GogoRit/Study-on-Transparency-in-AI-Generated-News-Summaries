(AP) \u2014 An abortion provider on Monday dropped a two-month-old federal lawsuit seeking to overturn West Virginia\u2019s near-total ban.The Women\u2019s Health Center of West Virginia said in a court filing that its primary physician determined he will be unable to resume providing abortion care in the state \u201cdue to intervening professional obligations.\u201d Another physician who provided abortion care at West Virginia\u2019s only abortion clinic prior to the passage of a law last year is no longer available, the filing said.While the developments have not necessarily rendered the case moot, the plaintiffs \u201chave determined that it is in their best interests and the interests of judicial economy to voluntarily dismiss this case without prejudice at this time,\u201d according to the filing in federal court in Charleston.The lawsuit filed Feb. 1 named the West Virginia Board of Medicine\u2019s president and secretary as defendants. It claimed the law was unconstitutional, irrational and caused irreparable harm to the clinic and its patients.\n\nState Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who had intervened on behalf of the state, said \u201cmy office stands ready to defend this clearly constitutional law to the fullest should this lawsuit be refiled, or against any other legal challenge.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeals panel asks West Virginia court whether opioids distribution can cause a public nuisance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia Republican governor signs budget, vows to bring back lawmakers for fixes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans are seeking unity at an idyllic West Virginia retreat. Many didn\u2019t bother to come\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit had asked for a halt to the abortion ban while the case was heard. Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Sept. 16 signed a bill passed earlier that week making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling overturning its constitutional protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Charleston clinic suspended abortions shortly after lawmakers passed the bill and provided West Virginia women with resources to book appointments out-of-state and funding to help cover the costs of travel and the procedure, clinic Executive Director Katie Qui\u00f1onez said.\n\nLast month Qui\u00f1onez announced she will serve as executive director of an abortion clinic that will open in June in Cumberland, Maryland, which is close to the West Virginia border.The West Virginia law requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital \u2014 a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women\u2019s Health Center, which had provided the procedure since 1976. Under the law, providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison. The state\u2019s abortion ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police.More than a dozen states now have abortion bans, though most were approved before the Supreme Court ruling and took effect once the court threw out the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
