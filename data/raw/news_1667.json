Wade after almost 50 years and allowed states to enact near or total bans on abortion. While some Republicans have pushed to expand on the ruling with a national ban \u2014 or a compromise ban that would limit abortions after a certain point \u2014 many Republicans have rejected that option. And it has become clear that most Americans would oppose it.\nA July AP-NORC poll showed Republicans are largely opposed to allowing abortion \u201cfor any reason\u201d and after 15 weeks into a pregnancy. But only 16% of Republicans say abortion generally should be \u201cillegal in all cases,\u201d and a majority, 56%, say their state should generally allow abortion six weeks into a pregnancy. According to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the midterm electorate, 61% of all voters said they were in favor of a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.\nREAD MORE: Court says abortion doctors can\u2019t be charged under Arizona law\nThe national sentiment has made some Republicans wary of the party\u2019s traditional full-throated opposition to abortion rights.\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican who says she is opposed to abortion, said she believes the early push on the issue is misguided. She said she believes the majority of voters in her swing district opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overrule Roe.\n\u201cThis is probably not the way to start off the week,\u201d Mace told MSNBC.\nRepublicans supporting the two measures took pains not to connect them with overturning Roe, emphasizing that they were narrowly focused.\n\u201cI want to be absolutely clear that this bill has nothing to do with the Supreme Court decision,\u201d said Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, the Republican sponsor of the bill.\nRep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia said the measures passed Wednesday reflect what Republicans see as immediate abortion priorities. House Republicans still \u201cneed to have a discussion\u201d about more wholesale changes, namely an abortion ban, he said.\nREAD MORE: Abortion-rights groups prepare for more battles following 2022 victories\nLoudermilk said he thinks the issue should be left to the states for now, \u201cotherwise we start muddying the waters again.\u201d\nEmboldened by public opposition to the Supreme Court decision, Democrats enthusiastically opposed the measures, predicting that Republicans were only laying the groundwork for a national ban.\n\u201cThe differences between our side of the aisle and their side of the aisle couldn\u2019t be any clearer,\u201d said Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\nDemocrats criticized the resolution condemning attacks on pro-life facilities as one-sided because it did not condemn similar \u2014 and long-standing \u2014 violence against abortion clinics. The resolution is \u201cwoefully incomplete,\u201d said New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.\nThe Democrats argued that the legislation imposing new penalties on doctors is unnecessary because it is already illegal to kill an infant. It would create complicated new standards making it harder for health providers to do their jobs, they said.\n\u201cIt is a mean-spirited solution in search of a problem,\u201d said Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif.\nLast summer, the Democratic-led House voted to restore abortion rights nationwide, but that legislation was blocked in the closely divided Senate. That bill would have expanded on the protections Roe had previously provided by banning what supporters say are medically unnecessary restrictions that block access to safe and accessible abortions.\nThe GOP bills are destined to suffer a similar fate in the Senate this session. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Americans elected Senate Democrats \u201cto be a firewall\u201d against what he said are Republicans\u2019 extreme views.\n\u201cRepublicans are proving how dangerously out of touch they are with mainstream America,\u201d Schumer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                National sentiment has made some Republicans wary of the party\u2019s traditional full-throated opposition to abortion rights.
