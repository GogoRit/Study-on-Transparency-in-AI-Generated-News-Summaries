Whereas this declaration is seen as a move to restrict the practice of abortion, it has a contrary and dire effect of driving the practice underground by making it more deadly including by increasing abortion stigma,\u201d they added. \n\nThe activists add that, this move by government, will in turn, contribute to high rates of preventable morbidity and mortality in Uganda contrary to projections made under Vision 2040- which prioritised that maternal health must be improved if Uganda is to meet its development targets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPregnant girls need to be supported and not shunned by society, otherwise, we make them more vulnerable to the ills of society,\u201d said Ms Annah Kukundakwe, the program officer with Center for Health, Human Rights and Development. \n\nLikewise, Ms Primah Kwagala, the executive director of the Women\u2019s Pro Bono Initiative said: \u201cOur government is playing with the lives and health of Ugandan women and girls by cozying up to extremist agenda.\u201d \n\nAccording to the CSOs, core to the Geneva Consensus Declaration is that it doesn\u2019t recognize sexual and gender diversity as well as human rights related to sexual orientation and gender identities. \n\nEfforts to reach out to the health minister were futile as our call went answered at press time. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister to continue reading this premium article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, please!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already have an account?\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister to begin your journey to our premium content\nSubscribe for full access to premium content\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nYou already have a Subscription?\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor.
