Violence against women and girls is one of the most prevalent human rights violations in the world,\u201d he said,\nAccording to Shangula gender-violence undermines the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims, yet it remains shrouded in a culture of silence.\n\u201cVictims of violence can suffer sexual and reproductive health consequences, including forced and unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, traumatic fistula, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and even death,\u201d he added.\nShangula said the received support is in line with Ministry\u2019s strategic interventions for post-violence care.\n\u201cWe really thank the UN and UNFPA in particular, for this generous donation. It would surely go a long way in addressing women\u2019s reproductive health, particularly access to emergency reproductive health medical services,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, the minister urged the Central Medical Store and the Directorate of Primary Health Care Services to coordinate the distribution of these commodities and equipment effectively.\n\nCaption: The Minister of Health and Social Services, Dr Kalumbi Shangula on receiving the donation fromMs. Dennia Gayle, UNFPA Country Representative.\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousAir Namibia suspends domestic flights as COVID-19 pandemic hits-hard \n\nNextNamibia focuses on the development of women\u2019s cricket, appoints new national coach \n\n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Staff Reporter\nThe staff reporter is the most senior in-house Economist reporter.
