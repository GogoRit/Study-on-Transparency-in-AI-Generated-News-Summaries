The university has now apologised and agreed a settlement.\nThe student midwife said: \u201cPutting my life on hold because of an unjust investigation was really difficult, both mentally and emotionally.\n\u201cThe settlement demonstrates that the university\u2019s treatment of me was wrong, and while I\u2019m happy to move on, I hope this means that no other student will have to experience what I have.\n\u201cWhat happened to me risks creating a fear among students to discuss their values and beliefs, but university should be the place where you are invited to do just that.\u201d\nApology\nA University of Nottingham spokesperson said: \u201cWhile all universities take fitness-to-practise considerations extremely seriously, the university has offered an apology and settlement to Ms Rynkiewicz and is considering how we might approach such cases differently in future.\u201d\nWhile they stated that the university\u2019s official position is pro-abortion, they added: \u201cUniversities should be spaces to debate, discuss and disagree\u201d.\nRynkiewicz was helped by religious liberty charity Alliance Defending Freedom.\nFree speech\nEarlier this year, an investigation by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children revealed that a number of universities in Scotland were found to be censoring pro-life student groups.\nThe universities of Edinburgh, Stirling, Glasgow and Aberdeen were all highlighted as particularly censorious. The assessment was made after their free speech policies were assessed in light of the Equality Act 2010, where philosophical beliefs \u2013 including the sanctity of life \u2013 are protected characteristics.\n\nAlso see:\n\nPro-life student groups gagged by Scottish universities\nPro-life legal win changes US university\u2019s policies\nEqualities chief backs Christian and pro-life student groups \n Education Secretary threatens universities over free speech censorship \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this story\n\n\n\nPlease accept preferences cookies to view this content.\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic\n\nBanned Catholic pro-life midwifery student wins apology and payout (telegraph.co.uk, 24 November 2020)\nStudent midwife penalised by uni over pro-life views (22 January 2020)\nPro-life student groups gagged by Scottish universities (9 October 2020)\n\n\n\nRelated Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Abortionists care more about changing the law than they do about women\u2019s safety\u2019\n26 Jan 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion (Ireland)\n\nAugust 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018One of the most liberal abortion regimes in the world\u2019\n16 Jun 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nManx people warned: \u2018Open the door to assisted suicide and safeguards tumble\u2019\n21 hours ago \n\nCreative Scotland pulls \u00a3110k of public money from pornographic film\n22 hours agoPornographyScotland \n\nTennessee Governor ensures no one is forced to conduct same-sex weddings\n1 day agoReligious LibertyWorld \n\nCI: \u2018Broad extremism definition poses unnecessary threat to free speech\u2019\n3 days agoExtremismUK \n\nStarmer wants to legalise assisted suicide if he becomes Prime Minister\n3 days agoAssisted SuicideEngland & Wales \n\n\u2018Report hurtful words\u2019 says Scots Govt \u2018hate crime\u2019 campaign\n3 days agoFree SpeechScotland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our free mailing list\nReceive news, prayer and action points, publications and access to exclusive events.\n\n\nSign up now\n\n\n\nChristian influence in a secular world\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nWho we are\nMPs\u2019 votes\nNews Archive\nPress\nSitemap\nSign up\nSupport us\nContact us\nPrivacy and Cookies\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nContact\n\nTel: 0191 281 5664\n\nEmail: info@christian.org.uk\nContact us\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Christian Institute, Wilberforce House4 Park Road, Gosforth Business Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE12 8DG\nThe Christian Institute is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England as a charity.
