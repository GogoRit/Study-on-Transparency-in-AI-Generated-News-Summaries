Soon after, the mother of the bride knocked and entered the bedroom, then paraded out a blood-stained bed sheet. The house burst into a celebration of the new bride\u2019s newly lost virginity.\nWhile the tradition of examining the bed sheet of a newly married couple for blood is mostly concentrated in rural Morocco, the phenomenon of virginity testing is not exclusive to her hometown of Safi, Ibtissam says. The practice transcends region and social class, permeating almost every aspect of Moroccan society. And it often includes\u00a0physical exams conducted by health professionals who deliver virginity certificates\u2014evidence of a woman\u2019s intact hymen.\nSoumaya Guessous, a sociologist and gender scholar at University Hassan II in Casablanca, confirms that the practice of testing for virginity is not limited to a specific socioeconomic strata or region. Medical practitioners all across the country give out virginity certificates, through the practice is concentrated in rural areas as well as more marginalized regions within urban cities. In fact, Imane Hatim, MD, one of the few gynecologists in Casablanca who admits to issuing certificates, points out these disparities within Casablanca, Morocco\u2019s largest metropolitan city. She notes that while it is rare for a patient to request a virginity test at her clinic\u2014Clinique Al Massira\u2014located in a wealthier part of town, it is much more common at her private practice in the \u201cquartier populaire,\u201d which she describes as a more conservative, working-class neighborhood.\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\nA woman walks out of the hematology laboratory in H\u00f4pital Ibn Sina, a public hospital in Rabat and office of doctor and feminist Asma Lamrabet.

Virginity tests are employed to assess the virtue and social value of women and girls, presenting a double standard; males are often lauded for engaging in premarital sex\u2014while females are ostracized. \nIn October 2018, the UN and the WHO called on several countries\u2014including Morocco\u2014to abolish the practice, condemning it as medically unnecessary, painful, humiliating, and traumatic human rights violation. In response, Moroccan government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi stated that the tests are not legally required before marriage. However, he failed to acknowledge that despite not being required legally, virginity tests are still rampant and valued in family, criminal, and legal matters in Moroccan society. \nOne year after the UN and WHO call to action, feminists and doctors in Morocco have led social awareness campaigns to spur progress. In December 2018, Betty Lachgar, founder of Mouvement Alternatif pour Les Libert\u00e9s Individuelles, known as MALI\u2014a civil disobedience movement in Morocco\u2014released a statement titled \u201cMy Vulva is Mine,\u201d calling for social reform regarding virginity testing.\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\nBetty Lachgar, founder of MALI, is calling for social reform and women\u2019s rights in Morocco. She denounces virginity testing as a form of torture and rape. Image by Samidha Sane.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe accused them [gynecologists] of complicity because it [the virginity test] is a form of torture and rape,\u201d Lachgar said. In response to MALI\u2019s campaign, a group of Moroccan doctors united to denounce the practice. \nProudly, Lachgar said, \u201cWe had a little victory...it was the first time that gynecologists talked about this and wrote a release to say they wouldn\u2019t do it [practice the test] anymore.\u201d\nDespite these calls for action, Guessous explained that legal change has been slow due to widespread societal and family pressure on a woman to remain a virgin until marriage. Doctors\u2014often covertly\u2014continue to issue the certificate. \nGuessous says, \u201cIt\u2019s violence for the young girl ... when she is put on the exam table, told to spread her legs, penetrated by the doctor\u2019s fingers ... and there are women [family members] there [crowding around the exam table] to see if she\u2019s a virgin or not.\u201d \nThe expectation of virginity isn\u2019t just inherently discriminatory and degrading; it can also lead to violence against women. \nThe more blood on the bed sheet, \u201cthe more the honor of the family is saved,\u201d Guessous said, even though the amount that a woman bleeds or even the fact that she bleeds is medically irrelevant. As a result, grooms are often advised to act violently during intercourse to ensure that their brides bleed their first time having sex. Women are rushed to the emergency room with vaginal tearing and other injuries because of such abuse on their wedding days.\nImane Hatim, MD, is familiar with these stories of trauma, but provides an alternate perspective\u2014that the certificate can shield brides from harm. Hatim advocates for the virginity test as a preventive measure\u2014a way of examining a woman\u2019s hymen and informing her before marriage whether or not she will bleed her first time having sexual intercourse. Hatim recounts stories of women who did not bleed on their wedding day. \u00a0\n\u201cWithout the certificate as proof to show their husbands, they come into my office beaten and bruised the next day,\u201d she explains, saying that she would rather give out the certificate and avert such problems for her patients. \nOthers point to the virginity certificate\u2019s utility in court. One woman (who requested anonymity) had to produce a certificate when requesting an annulment. The judge deduced the terms of the divorce based on whether or not the marriage had been consummated. In this case, the certificate helped the woman win the case and separate from her husband. \nAt the same time, Moroccan feminist and activist Fedwa Misk, founder of Quandisha, an online magazine for women launched during the Arab Spring, points out this legal provision could be used by newly-wedded grooms to justify annulling their marriages after their wedding on the grounds that the bride was not a virgin, in cases where the bride didn\u2019t have the certificate.\nUnder the Moroccan Criminal Code, perpetrators receive longer, more severe punishments for raping a virgin than a non-virgin, Misk notes. This inherently implies that the worth of a woman is between her thighs, based on whether or not her hymen is intact. Moreover, it classifies rape as a crime against the honor of a woman\u2019s family as opposed to the integrity of the victim.\n\u201cIt demonstrates that there is a hierarchy,\u201d Lachgar said. \u201cThat there are some victims worse off than others... and that if you\u2019re not a virgin, you\u2019re not losing anything if you get raped.\u201d\nEvidently, the system itself is cyclical\u2014the necessity of the virginity test in Moroccan law to determine the fate of young girls in cases of rape and annulment propagates its prevalence in culture and society. At the same time, because of its pervasiveness, legal institutions continue to use it as a valid, decisive factor in court cases, ultimately maintaining its relevance and use.\nAcross the board, women, doctors, and professionals agree that transforming the culture of citizens and lawmakers alike is the best course to incite change in Morocco.\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\nAsma Lamrabet, MD, at her office in Rabat, Morocco, 2019. Image by Samidha Sane.\n\n\n\n\nAsma Lamrabet, MD, medical practitioner and religion scholar in Rabat, hopes to change outlooks towards virginity through her interpretation of the Koran from the \u201cfeminist and reformist\u201d approach. \u201cThe concept of virginity is not a religious concept...it\u2019s a social and cultural construction,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nThis construction, however, has proved difficult to reinvent as it is baked into the fabric of Moroccan society. In order to encourage constructive conversation, Lachgar says that more people\u2014including feminists\u2014must be willing to listen.\n\u201cOf course there are feminists who agree with us,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there is always a \u2018but\u2019 for them ... but society\u2026 but culture... but religion.\u201d \nMisk says education campaigns on women\u2019s health are needed, too.\nFor some women in marginalized communities, she says, \u201cIt (the virginity certificate) makes the bride-to-be feel proud. This is the problem. There\u2019s no real issue for them\u2026 it\u2019s seen as a formality now.\u201d\nIndividuals may not see the tests as an injustice in the cultural context, but rather as a point of social acceptance and ritual. Farah, age 16, from the Souss-Massa region confirms this, saying about the certificate, \u201cIt\u2019s normal. Of course I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d \nBut other young women are starting to refuse the practice. Latifa, age 19, from the same region, explains that while she knows cousins and family friends who have gotten virginity certificates, she personally would not get one. \u201cI would feel like I\u2019m just a body for a boy,\u201d she says. \nHousein, age 23, agrees. \u201cI won\u2019t ask my future wife to get the certificate...it\u2019s a problem that our community judges just women and not men.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSamidha Sane is a sophomore studying Business, International Studies, and French through the Huntsman Program at the University of Pennsylvania.
