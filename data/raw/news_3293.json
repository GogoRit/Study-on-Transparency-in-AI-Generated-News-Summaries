Tate Reeves pauses during applause as he delivers his State of the State Address from the south steps of the State Capitol in Jackson, Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022.\n\n\n\n\nIn an op-ed titled \u201cThe New Pro-Life Agenda,\u201d Gov. Tate Reeves wrote that the pro-life movement must be more than anti-abortion \u2013 but he offered few specifics about plans to improve the lives of mothers and babies in Mississippi, which ranks last in the country in most indicators of child well-being.\u00a0\u00a0\nReeves said in the op-ed published Thursday that Mississippi will \u201cstrengthen our social services infrastructure\u201d and \u201cbuild grant programs\u201d for expectant mothers following the likely end to legal abortion in Mississippi.\u00a0\nMississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the country and the country\u2019s highest rate of children living in poverty. And in 2020, the state recorded the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\n \n \n\nReeves\u2019 office did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today about how much money his administration would invest in those programs and whether the governor would support extending postpartum Medicaid coverage for new moms \u2013 a measure that died in the Legislature this year. About 60% of pregnant women in Mississippi are on Medicaid.\nThe opinion piece was published in the Washington Stand, a news outlet run by the Family Research Council, a conservative evangelical organization that opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights.\u00a0\n\nThe op-ed covered much of the same ground Reeves presented in interviews on national television in May after the leak of a draft opinion showing the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe. The ruling in the Mississippi case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, will likely come later this month.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing pro-life is about more than just being anti-abortion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt requires working to ensure that every child who is brought into the world, no matter their situation, is given every opportunity for future success.\u201d\nDuring the 2022 legislative session, Sen. Kevin Blackwell, R-Southaven authored a bill to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to a year after childbirth. He pitched it as a pro-life measure, and it garnered broad bipartisan support in the Senate, but Speaker of the House Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, killed the legislation. Gunn claimed it would expand Medicaid, which he opposes.\nReeves largely stayed quiet on the topic during the legislative session. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper mentioned the failure to pass the extension, along with the state\u2019s lack of paid maternity leave and poor child health outcomes, Reeves said the root of the state\u2019s issues is poverty.\u00a0\n \n \n\nBut his proposed solution didn\u2019t include direct assistance or more accessible health care.\n\u201cWhen you talk about these young ladies, the best thing we can do for them is to provide and improve educational opportunities for them,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nDespite his claims about the importance of education, Reeves has had at times a contentious relationship with public education officials and advocates.\nHe has not made any serious efforts to fully fund public education. During his tenure as lieutenant governor and governor, the formula that provides the bulk of the state\u2019s share of funding for local school districts \u2013 the Mississippi Adequate Education Program \u2013  has been underfunded more than $2 billion.\nHe also opposed a citizen-sponsored initiative that would have incorporated in the state Constitution more of a commitment to public education. That proposal was narrowly defeated by voters after an intense campaign by Reeves and others.\nReeves has advocated for teacher pay raises, but the salary increases that have passed the Legislature have routinely been larger than what he originally proposed. And, of course, he famously filmed his 2019 political ad touting his teacher pay raise proposal at the New Summit private school in Jackson that was later closed during a federal corruption probe. Among other things, the probe accused the school\u2019s owners of collecting money from the state for students they did not educate.\nAs for increasing health care access for mothers, Reeves\u2019 office did not respond when Mississippi Today asked whether he would support postpartum Medicaid extension during the next session.\nDuring an April 19 press conference, a reporter asked Reeves about his stance on the issue. He said he had not spoken with the director of the Division of Medicaid about it.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to look at that and many other topics that exist out there that didn\u2019t make it through the legislative process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a decision in the future.\u201d\nMississippi Republicans have refused to allow debate on expanding Medicaid eligibility for Mississippians, which would provide healthcare coverage for more than 200,000 people at no net cost to the state.\u00a0\nIn the op-ed this week, Reeves again mentioned plans to increase adoption access in Mississippi. He wrote that the state will \u201cextend safe haven laws that allow for mothers to give up children they can\u2019t care for,\u201d but his office also did not respond to a question about what that would look like in practice.\u00a0\nMissisisppi\u2019s current law allows parents to relinquish an infant up to seven days after birth at a hospital, fire station, adoption agency, or mobile ambulance. Parents are not required to provide any identifying information.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to strengthen adoption services and help more children find their forever homes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build grant programs that support mothers in getting the care they need before, during, and after pregnancy. And we\u2019re going to strengthen our social services infrastructure.\u201d\nThe op-ed offered almost no specifics in terms of policy or funding proposals. He wrote that over the last five months, his office has conducted an analysis \u201cof our state\u2019s laws and regulations in order to identify any possible existing rules that might present an obstacle to expectant mothers.\u201d\nHis office did not answer a question about what the review had found.\u00a0\n\nAs an example of steps his administration is already taking, Reeves cited the $3.5 million tax credit for the state\u2019s crisis pregnancy centers, which he signed into law in April.\u00a0\nChoose Life Mississippi offers grants to about 40 such centers around the state. They aim to dissuade women from getting abortions and generally offer pregnancy tests and ultrasounds as well as baby supplies and parenting classes.\u00a0\nNationally, abortion rights and women\u2019s health advocates have criticized the centers as manipulative, focused on getting women in the door to try to stop them from seeking an abortion at any cost.\u00a0\nThough many of the centers in Mississippi offer free ultrasounds and medical advice to pregnant people, they are not subject to any regulations from the state department of health.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re also not evenly distributed around the state. A map on the Choose Life Mississippi website shows few centers in the Delta and southwest Mississippi, parts of the state that are predominately Black.\u00a0\nAnd the tax credit legislation contains no rules or reporting requirements as to how they spend the money.\u00a0\nReeves and other Republican leaders in the state have repeatedly invoked the centers as a solution for pregnant women, with no mention of other investments in health care or financial support.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that those expectant mothers, whether they want to be pregnant or not, have access to our pregnancy resource centers,\u201d Reeves said during a press conference on May 18. \u201cWe have 37 of them in Mississippi, situated in every region in our state.\u201d\nReeves wrote that Roe \u201cpaved the way for the slaughter of over 60 million children\u201d and that \u201cabortion is an unthinkable wrong that has wiped out an entire American generation,\u201d suggesting that women rarely sought abortions prior to the ruling. But historians say that\u2019s not true: Abortion has taken place around the world throughout human history. In the 1920s, for example, about 15,000 women died following abortions every year.\u00a0\nAccording to Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s draft opinion, Mississippi was late to formally ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy. It did not do so until 1952 \u2013 half a century after nearly every other state.\nReporter Bobby Harrison contributed to this story.\n \n\nYou deserve answers.
