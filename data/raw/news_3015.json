They're uncomfortable when I put so much priority on abortion,\" Pavone said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Monday.:One bishop told me one time \u2018Father Frank, you're too aggressive on abortion,'\" he said. \"So I said, \u2018Well, as soon as abortion stops being aggressive on the little babies, that it dismembers and decapitates, then you come and talk to me.'\"  Pavone was officially removed from the clergy on Nov. 9 after the receipt of a letter from Pope Francis' representative in the U.S., Archbishop Christophe Pierre, according to the New York Times. U.S. bishops were first alerted to the decision on Dec. 13.  \"As you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S.,\" Archbishop Pierre told the bishops. \"His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful. In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.\"  VATICAN KICKS PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST PRIEST OUT OF CLERGY, ALLEGES 'BLASPHEMOUS COMMUNICATIONS'  Father Frank Pavone, left, celebrates Catholic Mass for attendees at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference at the Hyatt Regency in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 27, 2021. (SOPA Images / Contributor via Getty Images)\"This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,\" the letter reportedly reads, without specifying the communications.  Pavone previously said that the \"blasphemous communications\" refers to him writing \"Goddamn\" in a Tweet in 2020.\"I used the word G-D in a response to somebody in a tweet and for that they want to throw me out of the priesthood,\" he told the Catholic News Agency earlier this week.  Pavone said he has not received any \"official notification\" of the defrocking as of Monday and found out about the matter through the Catholic News Agency.    Pavone told CBN that his pro-life initiatives, such as serving as the national director of Priests for Life and as president of the National Pro-life Religious Council, has allowed for Catholic priests to receive the necessary tools to be more vocal on pro-life issues, while \"showing compassion\" to women who have had abortions.\u00a0\u00a0\"Why would some in the Church oppose it? Well, the bishops have said, \u2018We don't like the emphasis you put on abortion.\u2019 Alright. \u2018We don't like the politics. We don't like you supporting pro-life candidates.\u2019 What do they want me to do support pro-abortion candidates like some of them do? No thanks. You know, but everything that we've taught and done has been in accord with the teachings of the Church.\"WHY BIDEN BEING DENIED COMMUNION IS A BIG DEAL FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH    Pavone had cemented himself as one of the most outspoken pro-life Catholics in the country, including by serving as national co-chair of ProLife Voices for Trump in 2020.Pavone said some in the church have tried to \"cancel\" him in various ways before the November defrocking decision, citing concerns in 2011 over Pavone\u2019s financial management of Priests for Life.\"They tried to discredit the organization itself. They raised questions about the finances, we knocked that down real fast, we have all kinds of audits showing we're in good financial management,\" Pavone said.  He also pointed to Bishop Patrick James Zurek of Amarillo, Texas, as a \"ringleader\" in his defrocking.    ABORTION IS 'GRUESOME SIGN' OF WHAT SOCIETY HAS FORGOTTEN, SAYS CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP\"[Zurek] has been trying to get me out of the priesthood. So we've had all kinds of communications back and forth, but the process has been a one-sided narrative. They don't listen. They pretend, even in their public statement now, they pretend that, \u2018Oh Father Frank's\u00a0 been given many opportunities to defend himself.\u2019 As if we haven't been defending ourselves, and doing so for 20 years. They're being so disingenuous about this. They don't listen to our concerns,\" he continued.

We know that we have to save these babies, and we have to have compassion for their moms and their dads. And we\u2019re going to keep serving them,\" he said, adding he believes it\u2019s the Catholic Church\u2019s \"problem\" if leaders \"are uncomfortable with that.\"\u00a0CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Fox News Digital reached out to the Diocese of Amarilo and the Vatican regarding Pavone's interview and comments, but did not immediately receive replies.
