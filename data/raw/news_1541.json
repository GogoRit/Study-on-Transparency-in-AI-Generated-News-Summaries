(AP) \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s new all-male Supreme Court reversed course on abortion on Wednesday, upholding a ban on most such procedures after about six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe 4-1 ruling departs from the court\u2019s own decision earlier this year to strike down a similar law.\nREAD MORE: DeSantis, Scott to campaign in South Carolina days after first GOP presidential debate\nThe continued erosion of legal abortion access across the U.S. South comes after Republican state lawmakers replaced the lone female on the court, Justice Kaye Hearn.\nWriting for the new majority, Justice John Kittredge acknowledged that the 2023 law infringes on \u201ca woman\u2019s right of privacy and bodily autonomy,\u201d but said the state legislature reasonably determined this time around that those interests don\u2019t outweigh \u201cthe interest of the unborn child to live.\u201d\n\u201cAs a Court, unless we can say that the balance struck by the legislature was unreasonable as a matter of law, we must uphold the Act,\u201d Kittredge wrote.\nIt was Hearn who wrote the majority\u2019s lead opinion in January striking down the ban. The court ruled then that the law violated the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy.\nHearn then reached the court\u2019s mandatory retirement age, enabling the Republican-dominated legislature to put Gary Hill on what is now the nation\u2019s only state Supreme Court with an entirely male bench.\nWith a newly configured Supreme Court, Republican lawmakers enacted a new abortion law in 2023 that they thought would pass muster a second time around. Specifically, the law was crafted to address Justice John Few\u2019s concern, expressed in the January ruling, that lawmakers failed to take into account whether the abortion restrictions were reasonable enough to infringe upon privacy rights in favor of the right to life.\nAbortion providers, including Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, sued again.\nHill joined Wednesday\u2019s majority along with Few, who had previously voted to overturn the 2021 law.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that provided nationwide access to abortion, most GOP-controlled states have enacted or adopted abortion bans of some kind. All have been challenged in court.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Protesters gather outside the South Carolina House as members debate a new near-total ban on abortion with no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest at the state legislature in Columbia, South Carolina, U.S. August 30, 2022.
