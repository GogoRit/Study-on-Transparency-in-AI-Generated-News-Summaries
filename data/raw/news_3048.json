Newsroom, Dec 17, 2022 / 17:05 pm\nFather Frank Pavone, a well-known pro-life activist and national director of the organization Priests for Life, has been dismissed from the clerical state for \u201cblasphemous communications on social media\u201d and \u201cpersistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,\u201d CNA has learned.\nIn a Dec. 13 letter to U.S. bishops obtained by CNA and confirmed by multiple sources as authentic, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, wrote that the prefect of the Dicastery for the Clergy issued the decision on Nov. 9, adding that there was \u201cno possibility of appeal.\u201d\n\u201cFather Pavone was given ample opportunity to defend himself in the canonical proceedings, and he was also given multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop,\u201d explains a separate statement attached to Pierre\u2019s letter. \u201cIt was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions.\u201d\nPavone, however, told CNA Saturday that he had not been notified about the Vatican\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communication from Pierre does not specify the actions that led to Pavone\u2019s dismissal or name the bishop he disobeyed.\nThe statement refers to Pavone as \u201cMr. Pavone\u201d and calls him \u201ca lay person,\u201d underscoring the dramatic and immediate nature of the Vatican\u2019s action.\u00a0\n\u201cSince Priests for Life, Inc. is not a Catholic organization, Mr. Pavone\u2019s continuing role in it as a lay person would be entirely up to the leadership of that organization,\u201d the statement says.\nPavone is still saying Masses, including one streamed online Saturday. The Priests for Life website states that Pavone \u201cis a Catholic priest in good standing, and exercises his ministry in full communion with the Catholic Church.\u201d\nIn an email to CNA on Saturday, Pavone said that he was not aware of the Vatican\u2019s action.\n\u201cHow did CNA learn about this before I did?\u201d he asked. In a subsequent email he added that CNA\u2019s inquiry was \u201cthe very first communication that came to me about this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not clear in what diocese Pavone, 63, is incardinated as a priest. On the Priests for Life website, it says he received permission from the Vatican in 2019 to transfer from the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, where he was incardinated in 2005, to another, unnamed diocese.\nPavone hosted the show \u201cDefending Life\u201d on EWTN for many years until the bishop of Amarillo, Texas, revoked Pavone\u2019s permission to appear on the Network. EWTN is the parent organization of CNA.\nA history of clashes with hierarchy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally based in Staten Island, New York, Priests for Life is now headquartered in Titusville, Florida, within the Diocese of Orlando. That diocese, also, did not respond to CNA\u2019s request for comment Saturday.\nPavone has served as the pro-life organization\u2019s national director since 1993.\nIn that role he has a long history of conflicts with bishops, beginning more than 20 years ago with the late Cardinal Edward Egan of the Archdiocese of New York. Egan succeeded the late Cardinal John J. O\u2019Connor, who ordained Pavone in 1988 and encouraged his pro-life work.\nIn his email, Pavone directed CNA to a document posted on his personal website titled \u201cSummary of How Fr. Frank and Priests for Life Have Been Treated by Some in the Hierarchy.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe all expect that the pro-abortion groups, like Planned Parenthood, will target, harass and try to intimidate us. And they do try,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cBut when such treatment comes from bishops and other Church authorities \u2014 which it increasingly does \u2014 it\u2019s particularly deplorable,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead of supporting and encouraging the pro-life work of the Church, some of these men try to obstruct and hinder it, and abuse their authority to try to intimidate priests and laity who make ending abortion the top priority of our lives.\u201d\nPavone has been at odds with Bishop Patrick J. Zurek in Amarillo since the latter became bishop there in 2008. In 2011, Zurek publicly suspended Pavone, though Pavone later had the suspension overruled by the Vatican. The Amarillo Diocese did not respond to CNA\u2019s requests for comment prior to publication.\nPavone\u2019s political activism played a role in his problems in Amarillo.\nAn outspoken supporter of former president Donald Trump, Pavone served on official Trump campaign outreach positions in 2016 and was originally a co-chair of Trump\u2019s 2020 pro-life coalition, as well as an advisory board member of Catholics for Trump. Canon law forbids clerics from having an active role in political parties unless they receive the permission of their bishop.\u00a0\nIn November 2016, Pavone filmed a video at the Priests for Life headquarters, urging support for Trump. The video was staged with the body of an aborted baby laid before Pavone on what appeared to be an altar.\u00a0\nZurek said soon after the video\u2019s release that he would open an investigation into the incident, calling it \u201cagainst the dignity of human life\u201d and \u201ca desecration of the altar,\u201d adding that \u201cthe action and presentation of Father Pavone in this video is not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Church.\u201d\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nOn his website, Pavone details his version of what happened in the video. He also has posted a transcript of what he said on the video.\n\u201cMuch of the criticism revolved around my having placed the baby on an \u2018altar\u2019 and some started getting into technical complaints about what should or should not be done with an altar. But to the extent that they want to get technical, so can I, and I pointed out that this was a table in our office, not a consecrated altar in a chapel,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThat table, sometimes used for Mass, was also the place where all my videos in this educational series of election broadcasts were made,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have made the baby video in a different location so as to avoid any confusion to begin with.\u201d\nPavone wrote in his account that the baby\u2019s remains were given to him so he conduct a proper burial, which he said he did after making the video.\nPavone stepped down from the two positions with Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in 2020 at the request of what he called \u201cthe competent ecclesiastical authority.\u201d But he continued to use his social media platforms to advocate for Trump and denounce the Democratic Party.\nThose posts led to another confrontation with Zurek shortly before the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn tweets that were subsequently deleted, Pavone reportedly called then Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden a \u201c[expletive] loser\u201d and said the Democratic Party was \u201cGod-hating\u201d and \u201cAmerica-hating\u201d and that Biden\u2019s supporters \u201ccan\u2019t say a [expletive] thing in support of their loser candidate without using the word Trump.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell do you have to say for yourselves, losers?\u201d Pavone asked.\nPavone also reportedly tweeted that he would hear the confession of a Catholic who votes Democrat, \u201cbut we are trained that in the absence of repentance, absolution has to be withheld.\u201d\nIn response, the Amarillo Diocese issued a statement disavowing Pavone\u2019s comments, saying he used \u201cscandalous words not becoming of a Catholic priest.\u201d\n\u201cThese postings are not consistent with Catholic Church teachings,\u201d the diocese said in its statement. \u201cPlease disregard them and pray for Father Pavone.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPriests for Life, \nFr.
