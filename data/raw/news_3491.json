But the US court is not responding to changes in society; this is the result of a 20- to 30-year strategy by the US Christian right to influence the whole American judicial system by training and placing its own people in the system.\u201dThe network is believed to have already made headway in Europe, including heavily influencing Poland\u2019s near-total ban on abortion as well as the outcome of same-sex marriage referendums in countries including Croatia, Romania and Slovenia.Although abortion is legal in Hungary, the procedure has become more difficult to access under Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s rightwing populist government.Meanwhile, LGBT rights have been gradually eroded in the country over recent years. Last year the Hungarian parliament passed a law banning gay people from featuring in school educational materials or TV shows for under-18s, and in 2020 effectively banned adoption for same-sex couples and ended legal recognition for gender changes.In Italy, the network is believed to have gained a foothold in 2019 when the country hosted a conference of the controversial World Congress of Families (WCF), a US Christian-right supported global coalition, in Verona.City of love? Christian right congress in Verona divides ItalyRead moreMatteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, a key component of the Italian government, spoke at the event, as did his far-right counterpart, Giorgia Meloni, who leads Brothers of Italy, the party currently leading in opinion polls.Since then, measures to restrict abortion \u2013 such as banning health clinics from providing the abortion pill or allowing anti-abortion activists to infiltrate hospitals to pressure women not to end their pregnancy \u2013 have been introduced in regions led by a coalition of the two parties and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia, including Marche, Lombardy, Piedmont, Umbria and Veneto.Moreover, even though abortion was legalised in Italy via a referendum in 1978, it has become increasingly difficult for women to access a safe procedure due to the high number of gynaecologists \u2013 seven out of 10 \u2013 who are \u201cmoral objectors\u201d.\u201cWe know that the broader network\u2019s strategy in relation to abortion is to first prevent, then restrict and ban,\u201d said Datta.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now in Hungary and in countries such as Italy are attempts to prevent abortion from ever taking place, through conscientious objection and ways of dissuading women.\u201dSilvana Agatone, who until she retired was one of the few gynaecologists in Rome who carried out abortions, said: \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse in Italy. We\u2019ve always had objectors but now the life of a doctor who does do abortions has been made more difficult as you have these anti-abortion people going into hospitals pressuring them, and women, not to abort.\u201cThey are also trying to rewrite medicine by paying people to produce material on the dangers of abortion that are purported to be scientific.\u201dAn influential politician with the League is Simone Pillon, who until his election as senator in March 2018 was an adviser on the board of Novae Terrae, an anti-abortion organisation headed by his close friend, Luca Volant\u00e8, a politician with the now defunct Union of the Centre party and former chairman of the parliamentary group of the European People\u2019s party.Novae Terrae was an integral player in Agenda Europe, at least until Volant\u00e8 was investigated for money laundering. Volant\u00e8 was recently cleared of the allegations.Pillon said he is aware of Agenda Europe, which he described as akin \u201cto a group of friends getting together\u201d, but never attended any of its meetings.Pillon has a 20-year history of close relationships with Italian anti-abortion groups and attended a large anti-abortion demonstration in Rome on Saturday.\u201cI am from the pro-life world and then I entered into politics to bring forward the voice of the pro-life associations,\u201d he said.Pillon said he was \u201cenvious\u201d of the situation regarding Roe v Wade in US, adding that a similar outcome would arrive in Europe \u201csooner or later\u201d.\u201cIt was an ideological current that brought the liberalisation of abortion to the US in the 1970s, which then led to European legislation being adapted to this way of thinking,\u201d said Pillon. \u201cI am convinced this new wave will [unfold] in Europe. I don\u2019t know when, but I hope sooner rather than later.\u201dTrump shares CPAC Hungary platform with notorious racist and antisemiteRead moreWith the coalition of the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia standing a good chance of winning general elections next spring, he may soon have even more power to influence abortion policy.Meanwhile, PNfV will continue to strive to make waves. The speaker lineup at the Budapest summit includes politicians from Hungary, Spain and Slovakia.Hungarian speakers include MEPs from the ruling Fidesz party, such as Balazs Hidveghi and Enik\u0151 Gy\u0151ri. Miklos Sz\u00e1nth\u00f3, the director of the Center for Fundamental Rights, who hosted CPAC Hungary last week, is also expected to speak, as is Zolt\u00e1n Balogh, a commissioner to prime minister Orb\u00e1n.Hungary\u2019s newly elected president and former families minister, Katalin Nov\u00e1k, had been a board member of PNfV since as early as 2015 and became its chairperson in 2019.However, she resigned from the role in March after being elected Hungarian president. In comments to Breitbart in 2019, she said there is no \u201cchoice\u201d when it comes to abortion. \u201cPro-abortion is pro-killing, it is against choice,\u201d she said.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenEuropeRoe v WadeItalyHungaryVaticanfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
