A federal judge found that just one of Louisiana\u2019s three abortion clinics would remain open if the law is allowed to take effect.\nPro-life and pro-choice activists gather at the Supreme Court for the National March for Life rally in Washington, D.C.  in January. Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters\nAbortion-rights protesters filled the sidewalk in front of the court Wednesday morning. A smaller group of anti-abortion demonstrators stood across the street, some blowing shofars, rams\u2019 horns used in Jewish services, to try to drown out the other side\u2019s speakers.\nThe Louisiana law is similar to one in Texas that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. Since then, though, Donald Trump was elected president and he appointed two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who have shifted the court to the right. Even with those two additions to the court, Chief Justice John Roberts almost certainly holds the deciding vote.\nWhen the justices temporarily blocked the Louisiana law from taking effect a year ago, Roberts joined the court\u2019s four liberal justices to put it on hold. Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were among the four conservatives who would have allowed the law to take effect.\nThose preliminary votes do not bind the justices when they undertake a thorough review of an issue, but they often signal how a case will come out.\nRoberts has generally voted to uphold abortion restrictions in more than 14 years as chief justice, including in the Texas case four years ago.\nIt is for now unclear whether Roberts\u2019 outlook on the Louisiana case has been affected by his new role as the court\u2019s swing justice since Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement, his concern about the court being perceived as a partisan institution and his respect for a prior decision of the court, even one he disagreed with.\nThe chief justice asked an intriguing question about precedent Tuesday, wondering whether a 10-year-old decision would help determine the outcome of a case about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cDo you think that recent precedent should have a binding effect on how the Court addresses this case?\u201d Roberts asked.\nLouisiana, the Trump administration and anti-abortion groups have all firmly answered that question with a resounding, \u201cNo.\u201d\nLouisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said the Louisiana and Texas laws are not identical. \u201cLouisiana abortion providers have a record of non-compliance with basic safety regulations, and now they want a special exemption from generally accepted medical standards that apply to similar surgical procedures in our state,\u201d Landry said.\nThe Trump administration also argued in court papers that the high court could overrule the Texas case if necessary.\nJulie Rikelman, the Center for Reproductive Rights lawyer who will argue the case on behalf of a clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, said a trial judge found that abortions in Louisiana are safe and that the law provided no health benefits to women.\n\u201cThis is a law that restricts a constitutional right for no good reason,\u201d Rikelman said.\nThe court also has agreed to review whether abortion providers have the right to go into court to represent the interests of women seeking abortions. A ruling in favor of the state\u2019s argument that the providers lack the right to sue in these circumstances, known as third-party standing, would be a devastating blow to abortion rights advocates since doctors and clinics, not individual women who want abortions, file most challenges to abortion restrictions.\nA decision is expected by late June.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Anti-abortion marchers rally at the Supreme Court during the 46th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C.
