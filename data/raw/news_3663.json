Not a single arrest has been made in the more than a dozen attacks on pro-life organizations across the country claimed by left-wing pro-abortion group Jane\u2019s Revenge.    Jane\u2019s Revenge has claimed responsibility for at least 18 arson and vandalism attacks on crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) and other faith-based organizations throughout the U.S. since the May 2 leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade.The Federal Bureau of Investigation first told Fox News Digital in June that it had launched an investigation into the targeted vandalism. The FBI said in a Sept. 7 statement that it was still investigating the \"series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the US Supreme Court,\" but it made no mention of Jane\u2019s Revenge specifically.  \"The incidents are being investigated as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act violations or violent crime matters, depending on the facts of each case,\" the FBI told Fox News Digital in an email. \"The FBI takes all violence and threats of violence very seriously, and we are working closely with our law enforcement partners at the national, state and local levels to investigate these incidents.\"  A pro-life pregnancy center's office building in Buffalo, New York, was vandalized and the scene of suspected arson.

The same day of the attack in Madison, Jane's Revenge posted its first communiqu\u00e9 on the anonymous blogging host noblogs.org with a picture of the vandalism and demanding \"the disbanding of all anti-choice establishments, fake clinics, and violent anti-choice groups within the next thirty days.\"    REPUBLICANS PUSH DOJ TO PROTECT PRO-LIFE CENTERS FROM \u2018ASSAULT\u2019 BY VIOLENT ACTIVISTSIn another online statement on June 15, Jane's Revenge suggested it had local cells operating around the country and would continue its violence, calling it \"open season.\"\"Your thirty days expired yesterday. We offered an honourable [sic] way out. You could have walked away. Now the leash is off. And we will make it as hard as possible for your campaign of oppression to continue. We have demonstrated in the past month how easy and fun it is to attack. We are versatile, we are mercurial, and we answer to no one but ourselves,\" the statement said.    Since the Madison attack, Jane\u2019s Revenge has claimed to have carried out more than a dozen additional acts of vandalism on pro-life organizations.

On May 30, vandals targeted the\u00a0Dove Medical Center in Eugene, Oregon, in a rowdy demonstration organized by Jane\u2019s Revenge. While multiple arrests were made that night for disorderly conduct, no one was arrested for spray-painting \"ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE\" on the building.  \"We didn\u2019t make subsequent arrests or have investigations after the incident on June 24/25 was over,\" the Eugene Police Department told Fox News Digital. \"There were no arrests made for property destruction that night.\"Jane\u2019s Revenge claimed responsibility for two attacks on June 2, one on the Agape Pregnancy Resource Center in Des Moines, Iowa, and another at the Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center in Washington, D.C.
