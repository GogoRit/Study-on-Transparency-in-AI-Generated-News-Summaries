As You Sow subsequently withdrew its proposal noting it had reached an agreement with the company. As the Wall Street Journal has reported most proposals are withdrawn after the company accedes to some of the shareholders demands.\nAbortion is one of the most divisive issues in America. Why did you choose to engage in such an acrimonious culture battle, and what concessions did you make to As You Sow to get them to pull their resolution?\nIn response, Griffith largely avoided the question and instead appeared to read a canned response that largely focused on its employee health care programs.\nShe said, in part:\nOur goal is to have our employees across the United States reflect the diverse consumers and markets we serve and to offer those employees a culture, workplace and compensation benefits package that reflects their importance and value to our enterprise\u2026 Our current employee benefit policies, in our view, support employees in their role as parents and provide meaningful access to coverage for sexual and reproductive health services under insurance health plans provided by our organization, regardless of an employee\u2019s geographic base or position.\nShe went on to claim, \u201cwe will continue to have discussions with As You Sow but there have not been any concessions made.\u201d\nDanhof\u2019s full statement, as prepared for delivery is available here. Audio of the question and Griffith\u2019s non-responsive answer is here.\n\u201cHow vile and offensive that Griffith would talk so much about Progressive\u2019s health care policies and support for employees and their families. And did she really invoke the company\u2019s support for its employees as parents? Griffith\u2019s abhorrent response may be the most tone-deaf statement I have ever received from a corporate executive. As You Sow is advocating for the destruction of human life \u2013 exactly the opposite of parenthood,\u201d said Danhof. \u201cHow does that square up with Progressive\u2019s support for employees and their families? All Progressive customers, employees and shareholders should be outraged by the company\u2019s behavior.\u201d\nIn a Breitbart opinion piece published earlier this year, Danhof called out As You Sow\u2019s anti-life crusade, highlighting the fact that so much of corporate America already strongly supports the abortion industrial complex. With so many companies supporting groups such as Planned Parenthood and opposing pro-life legislation, Danhof wrote:\nWhy do so many American companies support the extermination of millions of potential future customers? It\u2019s a question that the media really needs to start asking corporate executives\u2026 how is it good for businesses to kill off swaths of future consumers? If your company is directly involved in the abortion industrial complex, an argument could be made that you need to kill more babies to increase profits. But the companies that fund Planned Parenthood and oppose pro-life legislation don\u2019t fit that bill.\nTo read Danhof\u2019s entire commentary, \u201cCorporations Killing Their Customers \u2013 Literally,\u201d click here.\nFor more information on As You Sow\u2019s\u00a0push to garner more corporate\u00a0support for anti-life policies, check out\u00a0FEP\u2019s Investor Value Voter Guide starting at page 48.\nToday\u2019s Progressive meeting marks the 14th time FEP has participated in a shareholder meeting in 2020.\nLaunched in 2007, the National Center\u2019s Free Enterprise Project focuses on shareholder activism and the confluence of big government and big business. Over the past four years alone, FEP representatives have participated in over 100 shareholder meetings \u2013 advancing free-market ideals about health care, energy, taxes, subsidies, regulations, religious freedom, food policies, media bias, gun rights, workers\u2019 rights and other important public policy issues. As the leading voice for conservative-minded investors, it annually files more than 90 percent of all right-of-center shareholder resolutions. Dozens of liberal organizations, however, annually file more than 95 percent of all policy-oriented shareholder resolutions and continue to exert undue influence over corporate America.\nFEP activity has been covered by media outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, Variety, the Associated Press, Bloomberg, Drudge Report, Business Insider, National Public Radio and SiriusXM. FEP\u2019s work was prominently featured in Wall Street Journal writer Kimberley Strassel\u2019s 2016 book The Intimidation Game: How the Left is Silencing Free Speech (Hachette Book Group).\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, founded in 1982, is a non-partisan, free-market, independent conservative think-tank. Ninety-four percent of its support comes from individuals, less than four percent from foundations and less than two percent from corporations. It receives over 350,000 individual contributions a year from over 60,000 active recent contributors. Sign up for email updates here.
