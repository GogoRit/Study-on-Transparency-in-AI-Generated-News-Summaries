The eucharistic procession, led by Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila, circled the perimeter of the facility thrice, marking an end to the 40 Days for Life in fervent prayer and witness for life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we realize that life is beautiful and it\u2019s forever,\u201d said Joan Murphy, a parishioner of Queen of Peace in Aurora. \u201cIt\u2019s something to be cherished. The sacrifices we make for our children, you know, help them to realize God\u2019s love for them.\u201d\n\u201cWe came here to pray because there\u2019s a lot of need for prayer,\u201d said Myra Bueno, a parishioner of Holy Cross Parish in Thornton. \u201cWe\u2019re here to defend life, because we know that this is important: to defend the life of every child. Everyone deserves to have a birthday.\u201d\nArchbishop Samuel J. Aquila offers benediction, a eucharistic blessing, to all of those present for the pro-life procession around Planned Parenthood. (Photo: Andr\u00e9 Escaleira, Jr.)\nPrayer indeed was at the center of today\u2019s gathering. In addition to the eucharistic procession, the faithful were led in numerous rosaries by the Sisters of Life. \u201cOne of the most important things we can do as people of faith,\u201d said Archbishop Aquila, \u201cis to build a foundation of prayer under our efforts, so that God is the source of inspiration and strength for our outreach to mothers and their families. That is why we are here processing around Planned Parenthood with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Only he can help us love those in need and, at the same time, those who promote abortion.\u201d\nThe procession was all the more powerful for those gathered in light of the recent signing of the Reproductive Health and Equity Act (RHEA) into law. \u201cWe are very sad and dismayed by the signing of HB22-1279 into law because this law is the only one in the world that doesn\u2019t have any restriction,\u201d said Laura Acosta. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t only affect Catholics, but the whole world because this doesn\u2019t only affect religion, but the dignity of the human person. We hope in God that he can put an end to all of this and that we all can love and help each other like he wants us to.\u201d\nMyra Bueno and her daughter, Laura Acosta, and countless others processed prayerfully to witness for life on Saturday. (Photo: Andr\u00e9 Escaleira, Jr.)\n\u201cThe recent signing into law of RHEA means that we must redouble our efforts to help mothers and fathers who are considering abortion,\u201d said Archbishop Aquila. \u201cThere is already great work being done through the Marisol Health clinics, crisis pregnancy centers, support groups like Project Rachael and various parish-based ministries, but we have a long way to go in building a culture that welcomes life at every stage and in every condition. Supporters of RHEA have said they want to make Colorado an abortion destination, so we must work to make it a safe haven for unborn children.\u201d\n\u201cI think we have to keep praying,\u201d said Bueno. \u201cWe have to keep these people in prayer: the workers who work at this clinic and the people that work in the Capitol that passed this law.\u201d\nHundreds gathered in prayer as they processed around Stapleton\u2019s Planned Parenthood facility on Saturday.
