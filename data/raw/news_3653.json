Planned Parenthood and fighting for the innocent\n September 9, 2022 : By Logan Smith - Office of Communications & Public Engagement \n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\nSHARE\ntwitter_logo\nfacebook_logo\nlinkedin_logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Planned Parent employee-turned pro-life activist Abby Johnson, whose testimony and memoir inspired the movie \u201cUnplanned,\u201d challenged students in Friday\u2019s Convocation to be bold amidst a daunting secular culture that promotes abortion.\nYears ago, Johnson volunteered at Planned Parenthood and eventually became the director of the clinic. Over her eight-year career in the industry, Johnson helped facilitate more than 22,000 abortions.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t even know how I got to that point,\u201d she told students. \u201cIt just happened in a blink of an eye.\u201d\nHer transition to pro-life advocacy started when she assisted with an ultrasound-guided abortion procedure. At 13 weeks, the pre-born baby had every bodily function and anatomy as a fully grown adult.\nFor the first time, Johnson witnessed the true nature of her work as she saw the unborn baby suffer at the hands of a suction tube.\n\u201cI knew in that moment that what I saw in just those few seconds was not choice, was not reproductive justice; it was not justice of any kind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was certainly not health care. I knew that what I witnessed in those moments was murder. Murder of an innocent human being in the womb. And I knew I could not participate in that again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nJohnson grew up in a Christian conservative household, attended church every Sunday, and participated in weekly youth groups.\nShe told students that her downward spiral was a slow fade, beginning with immodesty in her language, behavior, and attire. Those habits ultimately steered her down a dark path of sin, leading to premarital sex, unplanned pregnancies, and abortions.\n\u201cThere are many sins that lead up to the sin of abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to bed one night, this good Christian kid, and wake up working in an abortion clinic. \u2026 Sin comes into your life one compromise, one justification, one lie at a time. It creeps in slowly, a little bit at a time. You are all just one sin away from walking down the path that I walked down. And it is not the path that you want.\u201d\n\u201cI was a compassionate person,\u201d she added, noting that her intentions to help women were genuine. \u201cI was a person who was seeking justice. But they perverted that sense of justice that was inside of me, and they used it against the innocent human being that I should have been trying to protect.\u201d\nJohnson encouraged students to live counter-cultural lives because she said the secular world aims to misguide and manipulate the vulnerable minds of young people.\n\u201cAt the end of your life, you\u2019re going to be face-to-face with the one true God. And He is not going to ask you how many friends you had on Instagram,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not going to ask you how many people followed you on Tik Tok. He will ask you what you did for the least of these.\u201d\nThe pro-life movement has seen tremendous strides in improvements in America, most recently in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\nJohnson challenged students to continue fighting for life, despite the ruling tilting in the favor of the pro-life movement.\n\u201cThis is the beginning,\u201d she declared before exiting the Convocation stage. \u201cNow is the time for us to stand up. Now, more than ever. \u2026 I can\u2019t end abortion on my own. I will not end abortion on my own. It\u2019s going to take all of you to help us do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nSHARE\ntwitter_logo\nfacebook_logo\nlinkedin_logo\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, Os Guinness challenges students to be champions and guardians of world\u2019s greatest love: the love of GodSadie Robertson Huff encourages Liberty students to see God\u2019s convictions as giftsPresident Costin speaks at LUCOM Convocation, urges medical students to represent Christ in their careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill 1\n\n\n\n1971 University Blvd\nLynchburg, VA 24515\n        \u00a0\n        Tel:\n          \n          (434) 582-2000\n\n\n          Contact Information\n        \nChat Live\n\n\n\n\nApply Now\nEmergency Information\nVisit Liberty\nRequest More Info\n \n\nCalendar & Events\nDepartments & Offices\nWork at Liberty\nFree Mobile App\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberty Local Time: 0:00 a.m. ET\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9  Liberty University.
