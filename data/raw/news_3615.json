Read our\u00a0privacy noticeKanye West wore a lanyard connected to a photo of a baby\u2019s ultrasound during an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News this week in which he declared himself pro-life. Speaking before the prerecorded interview was shown, Mr Carlson said that Mr West was often depicted as \u201ccrazy\u201d but that wasn\u2019t the interpretation he had during his Los Angeles visit. \u201cThe enemies of his ideas dismissed West as they have for years as mentally ill, too crazy to take seriously \u2013 \u2018look away, ignore him, he's a mental patient. There's nothing to see here\u2019. But is West crazy? You can judge for yourself as you watch what we're about to show you,\u201d Mr Carlson said. \u201cHe has his own ideas, we can say that, creative people tend to. That's why they're artists not actuaries. His freeform social media posts give the impression of a man channelling his rawest emotions right onto Instagram,\u201d he added. \u201cThe effect can be jarring and it's often used as ammunition against him in the battle for influence over the minds of America's young people. And that battle was intense, but \u2018crazy\u2019? That was not our conclusion. In fact, we've rarely heard a man speak so honestly and so movingly about what he believes.\u201dMr Carlson kicked off the interview by asking Mr West: \u201cSo you just came from Paris Fashion Week, you just landed and the lanyard is still on from it and there\u2019s a photograph on it, what is that?\u201dRecommendedKanye West tells Tucker Carlson his life was \u2018threatened\u2019 after wearing White Lives Matter shirt Adidas says its partnership with Kanye West and Yeezy is \u2018under review\u2019Kanye West meets Vogue editor over 'White Lives Matter' t-shirt backlash\u201cIt\u2019s a photograph of a baby\u2019s ultrasound,\u201d Mr West said. Mr Carlson inquired as to what the imagery meant, to which the rapper said: \u201cIt just represents life. I\u2019m pro-life.\u201d\u201cSo you wear it as a badge, what kind of response do you get? And amen, I agree,\u201d the Fox News host said. Mr West continued on by declaring that he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare about people\u2019s response as I care about the fact that there [are] more Black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point.\u201d\u201cFifty per cent of Black death in America is abortion. I don\u2019t care about people\u2019s responses, I perform for an audience of one and that is God,\u201d he said.Mr Carlson lauded Mr West for sharing his views and asked when he started to feel the need to speak up. The rapper said he initially wanted to speak out when former President Donald Trump announced his campaign for the White House in 2015. \u201cI think I started to really feel this need to express myself on another level when Trump was running for office and I liked him,\u201d he told the Fox News host. \u201cAnd every single person in Hollywood from my ex-wife, to my mother-in-law, to my manager at that time, to my so-called friends and handlers around me told me that if I said I liked Trump that my career would be over, and my life would be over.\u201dKanye West responds to backlash over \u2018White Lives Matter\u2019 T-shirts (Getty/Gabriella Karefa-Johnson/Instagram)Rapper Kanye West speaks during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval office of the White House on October 11, 2018 in Washington, DC (Getty Images)\u201cThey said stuff like \u2018people get killed for wearing a hat like that\u2019. They threaten my life ... they basically said that I will be killed for wearing the [Trump] hat,\u201d Mr West added. \u201cI had someone call me last night and said anybody wearing a white lives matter shirt is going to be greenlit and that means that they're gonna beat him up if they wear it.
