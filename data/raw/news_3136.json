Participants can share their pro-life witness and invite their social networks to pray on social media with the hashtag #9DaysforLife.\u00a0\nRecalling Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on abortion\nSponsored by the Committee on Pro-Life Activities of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, 9 Days for Life began in 2013 to recall the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling which legalized abortion in the country.\nAnnual March for Life in Washington\nThe novena encompasses the annual Day of Prayer for the Legal Protection of Unborn Children on 22 January, the day the Court handed down its decision and coincides with the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C..\nThis year\u2019s March is to be held on 21 January, and will be focused on the theme: \u201cEquality Begins in the Womb\u201d. The theme is meant to highlight how true equality is only possible if we recognize that children in the womb also deserve protection.\nThe March will begin at noon with a rally at the National Mall and will end on the steps of the US Supreme Court, where another rally will be held and will be attended by a number of speakers.\nLocal events\nLocal marches, rallies, Masses, and prayer events to mark the 49th anniversary of the the Roe vs Wade are also already taking place across the US in the leadup to the National March.\nSpeaking at the first of these local marches, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago said there are \u201cmany reasons to be hopeful\u201d that the Supreme Court will reverse the 1973 ruling.\nLater this year, the Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, an appeal by Mississippi to remove a lower court\u2019s injunction on its law banning most abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.\n\nThank you for reading our article.
