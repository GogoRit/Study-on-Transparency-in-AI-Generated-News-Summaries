Jones \n\nDenver, Colo., Nov 4, 2022 / 16:00 pm\nOut-of-state abortion backers appear to have interfered with a Michigan pro-life prayer event\u2019s online registration system in what organizers characterized as a \u201cpro-choice cyber attack.\u201d\n\u201cA few days ago, we realized that many of our registrations were fake and coming from outside of Michigan,\u201d Lori Becker, coordinator of outreach for the Diocese of Saginaw, said Nov. 3. \u201cThis caused our event to \u2018sell out\u2019 online, making it difficult for sincerely interested people to register.\u201d\nThe \u201cFight Like Heaven\u201d Ecumenical Prayer Rally event is still going ahead this Sunday, Nov. 6, at Saginaw\u2019s Horizons Conference Center. Attendees will pray for the defeat of Proposal 3.\u00a0\nThe proposed amendment to the state constitution would legalize abortion to the point of birth and have other broad effects, including ending parental consent laws for minors seeking an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt present, women in Michigan can obtain abortions for any reason before viability. After viability, abortion is permitted to save the woman\u2019s life. State courts have currently blocked Michigan\u2019s long-standing near-total ban on abortions. The ban has been part of state law since 1931 but was unenforceable under Roe v. Wade.\nBecker said organizers of the rally had asked attendees to register to help with preparations. However, phony registrations came in from IP addresses in Portland, Oregon; Boston; Chicago; and New York City.\nMany phony registrations appeared to come from pro-life organizations, which helped conceal the interference from organizers. However, some registrations appeared to be associated with abortion clinics.\n\u201cWe have been advised to report this to the authorities,\u201d Erin Carlson, communications director with the Diocese of Saginaw, told CNA. \u201cWhether there is anything that can be done, I\u2019m not certain.\u201d\n\u201cWe must all be alert, because in our defense of human life, we may become the target of organizations that even attempt to interfere with prayer,\u201d Carlson said, adding that prayers are \u201cpowerful.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe are grateful to God that we uncovered what was happening ahead of Sunday,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan\u2019s Catholic bishops have been outspoken against Proposition 3, calling it \u201can immense threat to the dignity of human life\u201d in an Oct. 10 letter.\nAt Sunday\u2019s rally, Bishop Robert Gruss of Saginaw is scheduled to lead the opening prayer.\n\u201cMy hope and prayer is that this attempt to sabotage our prayer event will backfire, and instead motivate people to join us,\u201d Gruss said in a Nov. 3 statement. \u201cMichigan women and children deserve better than the unjust Proposal 3.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer McDonald and Matt Lohr, producers of the \u201cI Didn\u2019t Know\u201d video opposing Prop. 3, will speak at the rally. The video, less than six minutes in length, has over 130,000 views on YouTube. It was created by members of Grace Lutheran Church in Coopersville, Michigan.\n\nOther speakers include faith leaders and pro-life leaders such as Alveda King, a niece of civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Among the Catholic speakers scheduled are a Catholic high school teacher, a representative of the Michigan Catholic Conference, and a local director of the post-abortive ministry Rachel\u2019s Vineyard.\nProposal 3 would allow late-term abortions due to an undefined mental health exemption in the proposal. It would define viability to apply only to children who can survive without extraordinary medical care, the Michigan bishops\u2019 letter warned.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect at the 2024 Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the proposed amendment would repeal existing laws requiring informed consent for abortion and parental consent requirements for teens seeking an abortion, they said. It would also repeal existing laws requiring abortion clinics to be licensed and inspected for health and safety reasons.\nFurther, the proposal would allow anyone to perform an abortion and prohibit any legal consequences if a woman is harmed. Michigan\u2019s Catholic bishops have warned that its broad language would codify a right for minors to seek sterilization and purported gender transition procedures.\u00a0\nSurveys indicate declining voter support for the abortion measure, though defeat is uncertain. An Emerson College Polling survey of Michigan voters conducted in October reported that 52% planned to vote yes on Proposal 3. Previous surveys showed as many as 64% of voters planned to vote for the measure.\nBishop Gruss reflected on the interference with the Saginaw pro-life rally.\n\u201cIt appears there are people from outside of our state who want to influence our state constitution through Proposal 3,\u201d Gruss said. He added that over $20 million in funding to back the abortion measure has come from six people or organizations based outside of Michigan.\nThe funds are going to Proposal 3\u2019s backer, the Michigan group Reproductive Freedom for All. In the last fundraising quarter, the Michigan pro-abortion rights group received $5.2 million from the \u201cdark money\u201d group the Sixteen Thirty Fund; $4.5 million from the Open Society Policy Center, the lobbying arm of influential billionaire George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations; $2 million from the billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg; and $4 million from Nishad Singh, an engineering executive at the Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange company FTX, according to the news site Bridge Michigan.\nReproductive Freedom for All received $34.1 million between July 21 and Oct. 23, mainly from \u201cdark money\u201d groups that are not required to disclose donors.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nCitizens to Support MI Women and Children, the coalition opposing Proposal 3, raised $16.5 million in the previous quarter. In that period, Right to Life Michigan gave $9.2 million, the Michigan Catholic Conference gave $5.9 million, and the Catholic dioceses of Saginaw and Lansing gave $100,000 each.\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nMichigan, \nAbortion in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin J.
