He's pushing out valuable voters.I support all the major Democratic causes of our day. But my party won't tolerate any dissent on abortion, and it is driving away voters like me.Kristen DayOpinion columnistI have been a registered Democratic voter since 1988, when I joined the Michigan State University Democrats and volunteered for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign. I have worked for three Democratic members of Congress on both sides of the abortion divide and have been to every National Democratic Convention since 1996. I support all the major Democratic causes of our day: expanded health care, a living wage\u00a0and policies that provide more support to families. No one can question my commitment to Democratic cause.For the same reasons, I am pro-life for the whole life. Abortion not only snuffs out the life of a human being but also worsens modern-day social inequities.In China and India, where doctors have aborted tens of millions of baby girls for their gender, it entrenches the patriarchy. In the United States, it discriminates lethally against disabled people and threatens to wipe out our brothers and sisters with Down syndrome. It trades violent solutions for a whole-life approach to human life: funding maternal health care, providing child care\u00a0and improving our abysmal education system. As a pro-union Michigander, my natural home is in the Democratic Party.Pushed out by abortion extremistsFor weeks, though, I have been trying without success to reach out to Democratic campaigns.\u00a0Democrats for Life sent our candidate questionnaire to more than a dozen Democratic presidential primary campaigns, asking candidates to provide their stance on freedom of conscience for pro-life Democrats. One of these candidates was\u00a0former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who we thought\u00a0would be the most likely candidate to understand pro-life Democrats and welcome us.This week, at a town hall\u00a0in Iowa, I finally had the chance to ask Buttigieg directly\u00a0whether\u00a0he would support more moderate platform language to include pro-life Democrats.\u00a0He refused \u2014\u00a0twice \u2014\u00a0to even answer that part of my question and instead focused on his unyielding support for abortion and did not really seem to want the vote from me or people who share my viewsThe Democratic Party used to support a\u00a0position that welcomes pro-life members. The 1996 and 2000 Democratic platforms noted that we are \u201ca party of inclusion\u201d and \u201cwe respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue.\u201dBut in 2012, the platform removed the word\u00a0\"rare\" in its discussion of abortion and, in 2016, the party officially called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibit federal health care programs from funding the procedure.Bernie's brand is a flop:Democrats court doom by backing Bernie Sanders. His ideas are toxic outside blue America.The reality today\u00a0is that the Democratic Party, hounded by abortion extremists, is deep in the pockets of the pro-choice lobby. As much as today\u2019s candidates talk about ending big money in politics, they make one major exception: the family planning and abortion lobby, a $3 billion industry that pads the wallets of political candidates to protect its own interests.Pro-choice campaigners have been stalling in the court of public opinion, against all expectations.\u00a0This is why they have resorted to megadonors to defray costs and fund campaigns. From 2001 to 2014, for instance, Warren Buffet's foundation has funded abortion access groups with an estimated $1.5 billion.Making 'future former Democrats'Buttigieg and Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014\u00a0who has also refused to affirm pro-life Democrats \u2014\u00a0might find it pragmatic right now to reject our overtures. It won\u2019t be pragmatic, though, when in November the Democratic Party loses a swath\u00a0of pro-life states to President\u00a0Donald Trump.\u00a0According to Gallup, 59% of Democrats support at least some restrictions on abortion,\u00a0and 29% actively identify themselves as pro-life.Nationwide, 20% of pro-life Democrats say they\u2019d only vote for a pro-life candidate, according to a 2019 Public Religion Research Institute poll.\u00a0States like Louisiana,\u00a0West Virginia\u00a0and Kentucky have Democratic voters who dislike the president in every respect \u2014\u00a0except his stance on abortion.The president and his advisers are exploiting this issue, and they are already\u00a0making\u00a0the extremism of the Democratic Party\u00a0a centerpiece of their campaign. This is precisely why the president appeared at the March for Life last week.Americans face an impossible choice:Here's how to help families and reduce partisanship: Support paid family leaveButtigieg likes to talk about \u201cfuture former Republicans.\" With his extreme stance on abortion, though, he is doing precisely the opposite: building an army of future former Democrats, disturbed by Trump but forced into a corner. These include several friends of mine. I don\u2019t want to join them.His position that we should not draw a line on abortion goes against the polling. More than 17\u00a0million Democrats identified\u00a0as pro-life in 2016, and 44% of Democrats\u00a0support drawing the line to, at most, the first three months of pregnancy, according to a recent Marist poll.According to our analysis of nationally representative data from Harvard, in 176\u00a0Democrat-held congressional districts nationwide, a majority of the population supports banning late-term abortions after 20 weeks gestation.As recently as 2008, the Democratic Party recruited 12 pro-life candidates to compete for congressional seats.\u00a0Several of them\u00a0won,\u00a0giving Democrats the congressional majority and the ability to pass a health care reform bill along with other important Democratic prioritiesToday, things have changed.The pro-life movement today is more inclusive than ever. The Democratic Party and its presidential candidates \u2014\u00a0less so.I want my party back.Kristen Day\u00a0is the executive director of Democrats For Life of America.
