Wade was overturned.Lowen said she started filming in Alabama, where the team was focused at first on documenting the abortion-rights movement.She quickly realized, she told ABC News, how crucial it would be to frame the film from a minority perspective by including multiple important voices from the anti-abortion movement.Protesters from both sides of the abortion debate wave competing scripture interpretations during a rally outside the Supreme Court, June 21, 2022.Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesA recent survey by Pew Research Center found that 62% of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A 2017 study by the Guttmacher Institute found that nearly 1 in 4 women will have an abortion in their lifetime.\u201cBattleground\u201d features three women in influential positions within the anti-abortion movement: the president of an influential anti-abortion lobbying organization, the founder of the largest anti-abortion youth organization in the country, and the founder of Pro-Life San Francisco.Part of the goal of the film is to challenge assumptions and notions about the anti-abortion movement by showing organizers that are neither religious nor conservative about other beliefs.MORE: Travel time to abortion facilities has quadrupled post-Roe, study finds\u201cWhat I discovered that really surprised me is that there are a lot of women who are leading the anti-abortion movement,\u201d said Lowen.One example is Terrisa Bukovinac, the founder of Pro-Life San Francisco, who identifies as an atheist, a feminist and a Democrat with progressive values. \u201c[She] is a very different face of the anti-abortion movement than many people expect,\u201d Lowen said.\u201cShe represents,\u201d Lowen added, \u201cwhat the movement is trying to do in terms of appealing to young people as single-issue voters.\u201dProtesters from both sides of the abortion debate wave competing scripture interpretations during a rally outside the Supreme Court, June 21, 2022.Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\u201cIf they don't grow their base and appeal to non-religious people, to young people and cultivate those single-issue voters,\u201d she added, \u201cthey may not continue to have the kind of success and inroads that they've had legislatively.\u201dDespite representing a minority opinion, the anti-abortion movement has been very successful. Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, opening up the opportunity for dozens of states across the country to restrict access to legal abortions.One of the scenes in the documentary includes audiotape of Lowen\u2019s team obtained from a conversation between evangelical leaders and former President Donald Trump, who was a presidential candidate at the time.\u201cYou really hear this deal being made,\u201d Lowen said, \u201cwhich is that if Donald Trump will advance the agenda and the priorities of Christian right, the Christian white right will rally their base to get out and vote for him.\u201dTrump\u2019s success in appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices was instrumental in the anti-abortion movement\u2019s success in overturning Roe v. Wade.MORE: How some providers are working around abortion bans since Roe v. Wade was overturnedThe documentary also includes interviews with leaders from the abortion-rights movement, including President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Alexis McGill Johnson.Lowen told ABC News she personally disagrees with the anti-abortion movement, saying it \u201cdeprives other people of their rights and other people of the opportunity to make health care decisions for themselves that are in their own best interests.\u201dRelated TopicsAbortion RightsTop StoriesFormer officer sentenced after pleading guilty to torture of Black men1 hour agoJudge rules evidence related to 'Access Hollywood' tape admissible in Trump trialMar 18, 6:35 PMState Medicaid offices target dead people\u2019s homes to recoup their health care costsMar 16, 4:18 PMTrump claims Liz Cheney and Jan. 6 committee should be jailedMar 18, 8:58 PMTimeline of college student's disappearance after night out in Nashville3 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights \u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n\n\n"
