(AP) \u2014 Mississippi has seen a consistent rise in the number of families accepting public assistance for child care since lawmakers banned abortion in almost all circumstances, with the sharpest increase coming after a child support policy change in May, the state human services director said Friday. Speaking at a legislative hearing on funding requests for the upcoming budget cycle, Bob Anderson, who leads the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the upward trend in voucher enrollment means the agency might \u201chit a wall with state and federal money,\u201d forcing parents to undergo a waiting period for child care assistance.The department counted 31,532 families receiving those vouchers as of this month, up from 24,500 last October. \u201cThat is on track with what we were told to expect when Dobbs happened,\u201d Anderson said, referring to Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the Mississippi case in which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the five-decade-old protection of abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade. \n\nAfter Dobbs, a Mississippi law went into effect banning abortion only if the woman\u2019s life is in danger or if a pregnancy is caused by a rape that has been reported to law enforcement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court appears receptive to NRA free-speech lawsuit against a former New York state official\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump ramps up dark rhetoric in Ohio stump speech for Senate candidate Bernie Moreno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Medicaid offices target dead people\u2019s homes to recoup their health care costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoucher enrollment further accelerated in May after Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, approved a recommendation from a council of early childhood administrators to do away with a 19-year-old policy that had forced single parents and guardians to seek child support from the other parent to be eligible for assistance through the Child Care Payment Program, which offers help to low-income parents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates had sought to change that policy for years, saying it deterred many single mothers from applying for assistance because, among other reasons, they feared identifying their former partners would lead to abuse. They also said that when parents couldn\u2019t find child care, it prevented them from getting back to work. \n\nLt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, also a Republican, disputed the idea that the abortion ban has had an impact on child care voucher enrollment. He said the increase cannot be tied to Dobbs because \u201cwe actually have less live births than we did before,\u201d and the spike results instead from the May policy change. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me it\u2019s not the Dobbs decision. It\u2019s the fact that we made this policy decision that\u2019s been approved by the governor and that you\u2019re seeing thousands of people become eligible because of that,\u201d Hosemann said. \u201cAnd the other side of that coin has to be that you will see less fathers responsible because they\u2019re not being disclosed by an individual.\u201dAnderson said more children are being born in Mississippi than there would have been had abortion still been legal, leading to increased demand for services.\u201cWhether that\u2019s a direct corollary from Dobbs, I don\u2019t know. We can debate that,\u201d Anderson said.In a statement, Reeves\u2019 office said the May decision was made because the governor \u201cis always looking for more ways to make state government more effective and efficient.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe listened to the experts and made the decision based on their recommendation that a change in this policy would allow more mothers to enter the workforce without being penalized,\u201d said Cory Custer, the governor\u2019s deputy chief of staff. \u201cIf it is determined that the previous policy is a better path to prosperity, we will be happy to return.\u201d___Michael Goldberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
