We break down Florida's current abortion laws and what's being argued before the Supreme Court.\nIs abortion legal in Florida?\nYes. However, abortion is banned after 15 weeks and six days of pregnancy. \n\n\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\n\nIf you're beyond 15 weeks and six days pregnant, there are exceptions that allow you to get an abortion, including:\n\nTo save the pregnant person's life\nTo prevent serious risk to the pregnant person's physical health\nIf the fetus is not expected to survive the pregnancy\n\nThose under the age of 18 must get permission to get an abortion from a parent or legal guardian, or a judge's order.\nA 24-hour waiting period is also required, meaning a pregnant person must visit their abortion provider for in-person counseling and then wait 24 hours before returning to get an abortion. This can be waived if their health is at risk.\nThe 15-week limit is outlined under HB 5, or the Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality bill. The bill also redefines the term \u201cgestation\u201d to measure gestational age as the time period starting on the first day of the pregnant woman\u2019s last menstrual period.\nThe law went into effect on July 1, 2022. \nBut in this past legislative session, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 6-week abortion ban into law.\nWhat does Florida's 6-week abortion ban entail?\nThis abortion ban, outlined under SB 300 (the Pregnancy and Parenting Support bill), would ban all abortions after six weeks.\nThere are limited exceptions, including:\n\nIf the pregnancy is the result of rape, incest or human trafficking. If proof of rape or incest is provided, the pregnant person may access abortion up to 15 weeks into the pregnancy. In those cases, pregnant people would have to provide documentation such as a medical record, restraining order or a police report.\nIf a fatal fetal abnormality is detected, abortion is accessible until the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nEven with its exceptions, the bill would become the strictest abortion ban the state has had in recent memory. Critics of the bill say many people don't even realize they're pregnant before six weeks and would have little time to receive care under the state's 24-hour, two-trip requirement.\nHowever, this new bill has been on hold.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Florida Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday in a case that could play a major role in the future of abortion rights in the state. Here's where the law stands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhy isn't the 6-week abortion ban in effect yet?\nThe 6-week ban will take effect only if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court. Justices will hold a hearing on the 15-week ban Friday, Sept. 8. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabortion\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJun 24, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion rights in Florida remain up in the air one year after fall of Roe v.

A 1989 Florida Supreme Court ruling set an initial precedent about the privacy clause protecting abortion rights, and subsequent decisions have followed that precedent.\nThe decision, known as \u201cIn re: T.W.,\u201d has loomed over abortion litigation in Florida and has been a target for abortion opponents.\nAs part of the case in Friday's hearing, Attorney General Ashley Moody\u2019s office wants the Supreme Court to back away from the 1989 ruling and leave abortion decisions to the Legislature.\nHowever, attorneys for the abortion clinics and a doctor challenging the 15-week limit argued that the Supreme Court should maintain the longstanding interpretation of the privacy clause.\nWhat happens after?\nIf the Supreme Court finds in the 15-week case that the privacy clause does not protect abortion rights, it would effectively allow the state to move forward with the six-week limit.\u00a0The 6-week ban would go into effect 30 days after the court rules.\nMeanwhile, a coalition of groups in May began a drive to try to pass a constitutional amendment in 2024 to ensure abortion rights. The proposal, spearheaded by the political committee Floridians Protecting Freedom, would seek to ensure abortion rights up to fetal viability, which has generally been interpreted as about 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nAs of the beginning of September, the petition appeared to have enough signatures to trigger a Supreme Court review. If justices sign off on the wording, Floridians Protecting Freedom would need to submit at least 891,523 valid petition signatures statewide to get on the November 2024 ballot.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under:\nabortionFloridaAbortion Ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTrending Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiami\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiami Open 2024 ATP Men's Draw brackets revealed\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly on 6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFamily searches for answers after woman disappears following flight to South Florida\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBroward County\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman who'd been missing since last month after arriving in South Florida found safe\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiami-Dade County\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMan killed girlfriend, her roommate before shooting himself at Bird Road apartment: MDPD\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdecision 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFlorida and four other states hold presidential primaries Tuesday\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWeather Forecast\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NBC 6\nOur News Standards\nSubmit Tips for Investigations\nNewsletters\nContact Us\nWTVJ Public Inspection File\nWTVJ Accessibility\nWTVJ Employment Information\nFCC Applications\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nAdvertise with us\nSend Feedback\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Privacy Choices\nCA Notice\nAd Choices\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.
