Women in sub-Saharan Africa are among the least likely to have access to family planning.The research also revealed that 61% of unplanned pregnancies globally in 2015\u201319 resulted in an abortion, up from 51% in 1990. Despite a slight fall in abortion rates in the early 2000s, rates had increased over the past 15 years. Researchers said the trend could reflect increased access to abortion or \u201ca stronger motivation to avoid unintended births\u201d.Climate, inequality, hunger: which global problems would you fix first? \u2013 interactive quizRead moreThe majority of terminations occurred in countries where abortion is banned or restricted, researchers found, which meant they were more likely to be conducted unsafely. At least 22,800 women are estimated to die from an unsafe abortion each year.Ahmed said even where it was legal some countries had deemed abortion not to be an essential service during the pandemic and had restricted services. \u201cThese service gaps could result in some individuals not being able to access abortion care at all, while others are forced to seek unsafe abortions,\u201d she said.The World Health Organization estimates that 270 million women who want modern contraceptives have no access to them. Universal access to family planning is a target of the sustainable development goals.A study published in the Lancet last week said increased access to contraception is crucial if new global population forecasts are to be realised. Researchers forecast the global population will be 2 billion below current UN predictions by 2100 if women\u2019s lives are improved.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsWomen's rights and gender equalityContraception and family planningHealthAbortionPregnancyFamilynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove & sexHealth & fitnessHome & gardenWomenMenFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
