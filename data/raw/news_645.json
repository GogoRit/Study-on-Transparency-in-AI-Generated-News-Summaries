Within the last year, major shifts in Congress, the Supreme Court, the White House, and state legislatures guarantee epic battles to solidify abortion rights \u2013 Think of the history of abortion law in the United States as a Rubik cube, manipulated over time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the US Constitution was adopted in 1787 there were no abortion laws on the books -- abortion was a woman\u2019s choice. If she wanted an abortion, no legal, social, or religious force would have stopped her, and she typically made her best-possible choice given her life circumstances, relying on self-administered herbal remedies ahead of a \u201cquickening\u201d gestational boundary that she could judge for herself from fetal movement. So far, so good. The law recognized the correct locus of abortion decisions \u2013 the woman herself. No puzzle to mess with. It worked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion laws began appearing in the early 19th century and by the early 20th century lawmakers, largely driven by male physicians eager to displace midwives and maintain control over the bodies of their female patients, had influenced lawmakers to make abortion a criminal procedure except in cases to save a mother\u2019s life. Laws varied by state. The law had twisted common sense and prevailing common law into a difficult, geography-dependent puzzle for women -- and illegal abortion became the dangerous alternative solution to an unwanted pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court returned the law to abide by the sensible decision of a woman and her choice of advisors, restoring the typical woman\u2019s logic of at what point in a pregnancy an abortion made sense for the circumstances of herself, her family, the fetus, and when it did not. States retained only limited (so we thought) latitude to restrict access to abortion to late term, i.e. third trimester, with exceptions even then for the life of the mother.\u00a0 Again, women had child-bearing options in life thanks to access to abortion care and, more importantly, reliable contraception.\n\n\n\nThen all hell broke loose. Contraceptive science and the Supreme Court had knocked the patriarchal world order for a loop and the guys in power scrambled to twist abortion law out of rational bounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith men in control of state legislatures from 1973 until 1992, restrictions on abortion were passed in almost every state. According to the Guttmacher Institute, \u201c\u2026states have passed more than 1000 abortion restrictions. More than a third of them were enacted between 2011-2019\u201d (See \u201cThe History of Abortion Law in the United States\u201d).\nSo, what has to happen now to get us out of this mess? There is both new hope and new peril on all legal fronts.\n\n\nThe White House\n1/22/2021 White House statement: \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to codifying\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and appointing judges that respect foundational precedents like Roe.\u00a0We are also committed to ensuring that we work to eliminate maternal and infant health disparities, increase access to contraception, and support families economically so that all parents can raise their families with dignity.\u00a0This commitment extends to our critical work on health outcomes around the world.\u201d\n\n\nThe Congress\nHopefully, with a new administration, we will see:\u00a0\n\nThe passing of the President\u2019s suggested law codifying Roe v. Wade crafted with air-tight legal language that can survive court challenges and override state laws designed to circumvent it.\nReplace reversible presidential executive orders with more-permanent measures to:\n\nRepeal the Hyde amendment that prohibits federal funding for abortion care\nRepeal the Helms amendment that bans foreign aid to organizations that provide abortion information and services\n\n\n\nSome legal scholars think that passing/repealing laws alone will not be enough, that an amendment to the Constitution is needed. See \u201cCodifying Roe v. Wade will do nothing to save it from conservatives.\u201d We\u2019ll have to stay tuned and be ready if this develops.\n\n\nPopular Opinion\nAs much as 77% of Americans believe the Supreme Court should oppose overturning Roe v Wade. See \u201cRoe v. Wade: The Constitutional Right to Access Safe, Legal Abortion.\u201d Other surveys vary, but nearly all show a majority favor upholding Roe.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court\nCourt watchers expect the current six conservative justices to, at a minimum, weaken Roe v. Wade abortion protections, and possibly overturn it outright. So, the onus is on Congress to codify Roe with air-tight text that passes constitutional muster.\n\nStaunch conservative justices defer to lawmakers and are quite persnickety about following the text in laws. Late Justice Scalia, the dean of legal \u201ctextualism\u201d said, \u201cThe States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so.\u201d (i.e., the text of the Constitution did not grant any such right.)\n\n\nState Legislatures\u00a0\nLawmakers in 19 state legislatures have introduced almost 50 major bills this year to ban most or all abortions, according to the nonpartisan Guttmacher Institute.\nFor example, in Arizona, the state senate recently approved a measure banning abortions because of Down syndrome or other genetic abnormalities, allowing the father or maternal grandparents to sue a pregnant woman on behalf of a fetus \u2013 currently unconstitutional, but a law that could stand if Roe is overturned by the Supremes.\nThe hope here is that US Congress succeeds in passing a codified Roe statute that passes the Supreme Court constitutional review that would stop these laws in their tracks.\nFor the long haul, supporters of abortion care will have to elect like-minded politicians in every state. A heavy lift in the short term, to be sure.\n\n\nWhat Should We Be Doing\nIn light of all the above, what do I hope to see in the coming months and years?\nWe citizens adapting my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s traditional skill of canning to lock in our Rubik\u2019s Cube of abortion law, secured on all sides, untwistable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is controlled and operated by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund works to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nTerms of Use\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nDonate\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nAbout Us\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
