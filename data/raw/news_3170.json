One was his respect for the music faculty. Another was the school\u2019s proximity to his hometown, Dallas. But what pushed him over the edge was the Baptist school\u2019s expressed commitment to Christianity. On its website, Baylor describes itself as one of the few institutions of higher education that continues to embrace its Christian heritage. The school\u2019s mission statement cites \u201cthe person and work of Jesus Christ\u201d and \u201cthe biblical record\u201d as foundational to its \u201cunderstanding of God, humanity and nature.\u201d \nNow a junior and president of the campus pro-life club Bears for Life, Folks is frustrated by what he calls his school\u2019s lack of clarity on life issues.\nIn 2020 and 2021, Folks and other pro-life students found Planned Parenthood\u2013related materials on Baylor\u2019s campus. Upon request, the staff at the health center sent Folks a handout that listed\nPlanned Parenthood as a \u201c[sexually transmitted infection] testing resource.\u201d Staff told Folks in an email that \u201cwe only send people to PP if they need STI screening services or low-cost birth control.\u201d A 2006-2007 handbook named the Planned Parenthood Teen Education Program as an internship site. Over summer 2021, a Students for Life staff person told Folks about a Planned Parenthood job opening for a \u201cCommunity Health Educator\u201d listed on the Baylor School of Social Work\u2019s website. And in the fall semester, two pro-life students texted Folks pictures of a class textbook that called abortion \u201csafer than childbirth.\u201d Folks believes those links to Planned Parenthood, the most well-known U.S. abortion provider, show that \u201cthere\u2019s not clarity on what Baylor stands for as a Christian university with respect to the sanctity of life.\n He and other pro-life students fear that\u2019s having an effect on young Baylor women. Folks and about six other students participate in a rotation of sidewalk counseling outside of the nearby Planned Parenthood, a 15-minute drive from campus. They have noticed Baylor students visiting the facility. \u201cI see Baylor cars go in there all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI see sorority stickers.\u201d\nFolks relayed his concerns to university staff members through multiple emails seen by WORLD, Zoom calls, and in-person meetings over a span of several months. He said the school removed Planned Parenthood from the STI testing resource list and clarified that the handbook was outdated and had already been replaced. But the School of Social Work didn\u2019t take down the Planned Parenthood job listing, although a Baylor official told Folks in an email that the school had deleted some wording on the page that previously stated the school was in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the organizations listed. Folks said the staff member working with him told him\u00a0addressing the textbook concern was outside of her authority. \nStudents for Life of America, an organization supporting pro-life groups in campuses across the country, listed\nthe remaining concerns about Baylor in a recent report highlighting connections between groups that support abortion and\u00a069 Catholic and Protestant schools throughout the country. Most commonly, the schools listed Planned Parenthood as a health resource for students or as an internship or volunteer opportunity. Some schools have allowed the abortion business to exhibit at career fairs. Originally, the Students for Life researchers found 103 Catholic and Protestant schools with some sort of Planned Parenthood connection, but 34 schools removed all such references after Students for Life contacted them privately with the information. \nFor example, the websites of the University of Notre Dame and St. John\u2019s University, both Catholic institutions, had listed Planned Parenthood as a potential employer for their women\u2019s studies programs. University officials at both schools removed the content, telling Students for Life they were outdated materials. The University of San Francisco, also Catholic, had listed Planned Parenthood as an internship partner but removed the pages in October after hearing from Students for Life. \nBut some schools, like Baylor, pushed back, according to the pro-life organization. I reached out to Baylor for comment about the report. Chief marketing officer Jason Cook responded with a statement from the university saying that Baylor \u201crespects the sanctity of life\u201d and does not allow \u201cfor the institutional promotion of abortion or abortion-related services on our campus.\u201d\nStudents for Life noted ongoing problems at other schools: Oklahoma City University, a Methodist school, still lists Planned Parenthood as a health resource (and an STI testing site) for students, as does Southern Methodist University. A spokesperson for Oklahoma City University told me, \u201cThe university will continue to include this resource on the website.\u201d Southern Methodist University said in a statement that part of the university\u2019s mission is to \u201cencourage and facilitate robust discussion of opposing viewpoints on controversial topics including abortion.\u201d That university pointed out that its Women and LGBT Center\u2019s website includes \u201cboth pro-life and pro-choice resources including \u2026 Birthright International as well as Planned Parenthood.\u201d\nNorvilia Etienne, one of the lead Students for Life researchers, contacted Baylor leadership via email in September about the remaining concerns at that university. Etienne copied Folks on the email. Later, the university\u2019s provost, Nancy Brickhouse, responded to concerns about the textbook, explaining, \u201cwe must support academic freedom for our faculty.\u201d (The textbook, Core Concepts in Health, is a common health textbook in higher education and appears to be in use at other nominally Christian schools. I contacted Baylor with questions for the course instructors but did not hear back.)\nIn response to a question from Etienne about the job posting, Brickhouse said it \u201cwas simply that, an opportunity for one of our social work graduates to work with a local non-profit that offers women a broad range of services. There is no evidence that this position provides or promotes abortion services.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate the commitment to academic freedom,\u201d said Folks of the provost\u2019s response. \u201cBut, at the same time, the whole point of a Christian institution is that we should be teaching through a Christian worldview.\u201d\nIn early December, Folks noticed Planned Parenthood was no longer on the list of social work job opportunities, although it\u2019s unclear when the listing came down or why it was removed. A PDF with a description of the Planned Parenthood job was still live on Baylor\u2019s website in early January, but a link to the job application website was no longer active. The Planned Parenthood contact listed on job description page did not respond to my request for confirmation on whether the job opening was filled. \nBaylor\u2019s statement to WORLD also noted the university\u2019s partnership with the local pro-life Care Net pregnancy center in community outreach efforts. But according to a 2012 letter to the university\u2019s School of Social Work from the Waco Care Net pregnancy center, that school discontinued sending students to Care Net for internships after doing so for five years. Cook said in December that Baylor supported Care Net, but he would not comment on \u201cdecisions from nine years ago.\u201d The Waco Care Net center director, Deborah McGregor, told me many other schools at Baylor continue to send students to Care Net for internships, but the School of Social Work \u201chas consistently ignored requests for interns.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Baylor University is actively promoting abortion,\u201d Folks said. \u201cI\u2019m saying that they\u2019ve been silent and that that\u2019s been allowing compromises in various departments that they need to stop.\u201d \nHe thinks the school\u2019s unclear stance may have contributed to the vehicles from campus he says he\u2019s spotted arriving at the local Planned Parenthood. \u201cI see people my age \u2026 and it breaks my heart that this is such a problem on our campus and that nobody\u2019s doing anything about it.\u201d Other sidewalk counselors, both from the university and from the community, confirmed that they\u2019ve also seen Baylor students going to Planned Parenthood.\nRebecca Brown, 40, has been sidewalk counseling outside of the Planned Parenthood for a little over a year. She comes weekly on Thursday mornings and said she sees young women wearing Baylor gear or with Baylor bumper stickers coming to the center once or twice a month. Brown told one such Baylor student on Dec. 16 about the pro-life resources available to her in the community and at the university. But the student replied to Brown that she had to go to Planned Parenthood because being pregnant at that point would \u201cruin her life.\u201d According to Brown, the student had come for an initial ultrasound consultation and planned to return later to take the abortion pill. \nKirby Paddock, who worked with Folks last year as the Bears for Life vice president, first came to Baylor as a married student. She knew there was a possibility she could get pregnant while on campus but worried about a rumor she had heard that Baylor expelled pregnant women. Paddock soon learned that wasn\u2019t true: The school hasn\u2019t barred\npregnant women from classes in decades. But, while on campus, she continued to hear the same rumor from other confused students. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of rumor that sends people to Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Paddock. \nFolks has heard it, too. He said one Bears for Life table in September polled passersby about whether or not they knew a student could be pregnant on campus, and a surprising number said no. He\u2019d like the school to publish a statement clarifying its stance on abortion. In the meantime, he and other Bears for Life members continue to hand out resource cards to raise awareness about the pro-life options available to students on campus. He hopes students with unplanned\u00a0pregnancies get the message: \u201cWe want to help you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Savas\nLeah is the life beat reporter for WORLD News Group.
