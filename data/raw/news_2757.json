But when it was life or death for the president, no one objected.By Antonio Regaladoarchive pageOctober 7, 2020President Donald Trump with then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.Getty This week, President Donald Trump extolled the cutting-edge coronavirus treatments he received as \u201cmiracles coming down from God.\u201d If that\u2019s true, then God employs cell lines derived from human fetal tissue. The emergency antibody that Trump received last week was developed with the use of a cell line originally derived from abortion tissue, according to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, the company that developed the experimental drug.  The Trump administration has taken an increasingly firm line against medical research using fetal tissue from abortions. For example, when it moved in 2019 to curtail the ability of the National Institutes of Health to fund such research, supporters hailed a \u201cmajor pro-life victory\u201d and thanked Trump personally for taking decisive action against what they called the \u201coutrageous and disgusting\u201d practice of \u201cexperimentation using baby body parts.\u201d But when the president faced a deadly encounter with covid-19, his administration raised no objections over the fact that the new drugs also relied on fetal cells, and anti-abortion campaigners were silent too. Most likely, their hypocrisy was unwitting. Many types of medical and vaccine research employ supplies of cells originally acquired from abortion tissue. It would have taken an expert to realize that was the case with Trump\u2019s treatment. \nLast Friday, as Trump developed worrisome symptoms of covid-19, the president received an emergency cocktail of anti-coronavirus antibodies made by Regeneron. These molecules are manufactured in cells from a hamster\u2019s ovary, so-called \u201cCHO\u201d cells, according to the company\u2014not in human cells. But cells originally derived from a fetus were used in another way. According to Regeneron, laboratory tests used to assess the potency of its antibodies employed a standardized supply of cells called HEK 293T, whose origin was kidney tissue from an abortion in the Netherlands in the 1970s. \nSince then, the 293T cells have been \u201cimmortalized,\u201d meaning they keep dividing in the lab, somewhat like a cancer, and have undergone other genetic changes and additions. According to Regeneron, it and many other labs employ 293T cells to manufacture virus \u201cpseudoparticles,\u201d which are virus-like structures that contain the \u201cspike\u201d protein of the deadly coronavirus. It needs those to test how well different antibodies will neutralize the virus. The two antibodies Regeneron eventually put forward as an experimental treatment, which may have saved Trump\u2019s life, would have been selected using exactly such tests. Because the 293T cells were acquired so long ago, and have lived so long in the laboratory, they are no longer thought of as involving abortion politics.  Related StoryTrump just got a dose of Regeneron\u2019s unapproved antibody drug for covidAt 74 and overweight, the president is at higher risk for serious illness. \u201cIt\u2019s how you want to parse it,\u201d says Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokesperson. \u201cBut the 293T cell lines available today are not considered fetal tissue, and we did not otherwise use fetal tissue.\u201d The Trump administration has sought to block or curtail research that requires tissue from recently performed abortions. In August, for example, a new board created by the Department of Health and Human Services, and stacked with figures opposed to abortion, voted to withhold funding from 13 of 14 proposals. The rejections centered on research seeking fresh supplies of abortion tissue, rather than ongoing research involving older, well-established cell lines in use for many years, like the type Regeneron employed. However, one reason some scientists want to study abortion tissue is so they can create new and valuable cell lines. Update: An earlier version of this story was headlined  \"Trump\u2019s antibody treatment was tested using cells from an abortion.\" The words \"originally derived\" were added to clarify that the cells are not from a recent abortion. hideby Antonio RegaladoSharelinkedinlink opens in a new windowtwitterlink opens in a new windowfacebooklink opens in a new windowemaillink opens in a new windowPopularLarge language models can do jaw-dropping things.
