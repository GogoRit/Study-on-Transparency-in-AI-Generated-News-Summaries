Prior to September 2021, the organization typically received an average of 10.8 requests a day from Texans.\nThen, the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 8, which prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point at which many people do not know they are pregnant. In the first week after the law went into effect on Sept. 1, Aid Access received an average of 137.7 daily requests from Texas, an increase of over 1000%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat big of a spike in requests shows us the uncertainty and chaos created by Senate Bill 8 going into effect,\u201d said Abigail Aiken, the lead researcher on the study. \u201cIf it\u2019s not certain that you can go to a clinic and get the care that you need, people will be looking around for what other options they have.\u201d\nThe demand for the medication has remained higher than normal in the months since, Aiken found.\nMedical abortion is typically a two-drug regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol that has been shown to be effective at terminating a pregnancy through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. In December, the federal government lifted a requirement that the medication be dispensed in person, allowing it to be prescribed by telemedicine and sent through the mail.\nBut Texas law does not allow the medication to be prescribed through telemedicine or mailed and has limited its use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life said the organization is looking into ways to pursue legal action against international or out-of-state groups like Aid Access.\n\u201cIt is concerning to us to see people try to find ways to work around the law,\u201d the spokesperson, Amy O\u2019Donnell, said. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s significantly important for girls and women to see a physician in person before obtaining chemical abortion drugs.\u201d\nBut as abortion access has narrowed in Texas, many providers say they are hearing from patients who feel that accessing this medication outside of the health care system is worth a potential risk.\n\u201cWhat option has the state given them?\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health. \u201cThe same amount of people still need abortions as they did before they started all these bans.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health operates four abortion clinics in Texas. For nearly six months, they have been unable to provide abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\nHagstrom Miller said there has been an uptick in patients detecting their pregnancies earlier \u2014 in time to access the procedure \u2014 but the clinics are still seeing less than one-third of their typical case load. Some patients are able to travel out of state to access abortions, but Hagstrom Miller said that\u2019s just not feasible for most.\n\u201cAlmost 70% of our patients are parents already,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re managing work and kids [and] school during a pandemic. They can\u2019t travel a few days to a different state. It just basically means abortion \u2026 is off the table.\u201d\nAnd the influx of Texans has led to long wait times at clinics in neighboring states, sometimes pushing patients beyond the window in which they can legally access care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHagstrom Miller said she\u2019s not surprised there\u2019s been an increase in demand for self-managed abortions \u2014 and that the actual increase is probably greater than any data can capture.\n\u201cThese folks are a little bit invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re either ordering pills online or they\u2019re going to Mexico. \u2026 Most of the time, a self-managed abortion is effective, especially earlier in pregnancy, and so we\u2019re only going to see the folks for whom it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\nAiken, the researcher behind the study, said it\u2019s impossible to know how and when patients use the medication they access through Aid Access \u2014 or how many patients are terminating pregnancies through other means.\nBut as the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to overturn the constitutional protection for abortion, Aiken said this Texas data serves as a snapshot of what whole swaths of the country may be facing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from this research and many studies that just because you make abortion harder to get, it doesn\u2019t mean the need for abortion goes away,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd many people, they will look for other ways of doing that.\u201d\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
