Anthony List\u2019s National Pro-Life Scorecard, which ranks elected officials\u2019 voting records on pro-life issues.\n\u201cOur Scorecard shows that Democrats led by Kamala Harris are voting in lockstep in favor of late-term abortion, taxpayer-funded abortion and even infanticide,\u201d said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cShe must be held accountable for her pro-abortion extremism.\u201d\nHarris, a pro-abortion Democrat senator and former California attorney general, supports abortion on demand and taxpayer-funded abortions, opposes religious freedom for all and once called a judicial nominee an \u201cextremist\u201d because of his membership in a prominent Catholic organization. Last year, she voted to block a bill to require medical care for babies who survive abortions.\nInfamously, Harris also prosecuted undercover journalist David Daleiden after he exposed Planned Parenthood\u2019s aborted baby body parts trade. Because of her actions, Daleiden is still fighting for justice in court.\nRadical abortion activism is becoming increasingly common in the Democratic Party.\nAccording to the SBA List, every single Democrat senator running for re-election received an \u201cF\u201d grade on its new scorecard. These include U.S. Sens. Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan, both of whom could lose their seats to pro-life Republicans in November.\nJones outraged Alabama voters in February when he callously laughed off the legality of late-term abortions in an interaction caught on video. When asked about his stance on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Jones laughed and called the issue \u201cstupid.\u201d\nIn Michigan, Peters also has a 100% pro-abortion voting record. He voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. He supports using tax dollars to pay for abortion and supports taxpayer funding of the abortion industry.\nPeters\u2019 Republican opponent John James has promised to be a champion for life in the U.S. Senate. He opposes taxpayer-funded abortions and supports legislation to protect babies and mothers from abortion.\nLikewise, in Alabama, Tommy Tuberville, who is challenging Jones, is committed to protecting babies in the womb.\nAlso receiving \u201cF\u201d grades from the pro-life organization are 28 House Democrats running in districts that Republican President Donald Trump won in 2016. They are: Reps. Tom O\u2019Halleran (AZ-01), Susie Lee (NV-03), Xochitl Torres Small (NM-02), Kendra Horn (OK-05), Angie Craig (MN-02), Abby Finkenauer (IA-01), Dave Loebsack (IA-02), Cindy Axne (IA-03), Ron Kind (WI-03), Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Cheri Bustos (IL-17), Elissa Slotkin (MI-08), Haley Stevens (MI-11), Lucy McBath (GA-06), Matt Cartwright (PA-08), Conor Lamb (PA-17), Jared Golden (ME-02), Chris Pappas (NH-01), Max Rose (NY-11), Carolyn Maloney (NY-18), Antonio Delgado (NY-19), Anthony Brindisi (NY-22), Andy Kim (NJ-03), Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), Mike Sherrill (NJ-11), Elaine Luria (VA-02), Abigail Spanberger (VA-07), Joe Cunningham (SC-01).\nThe Pro-Life Scorecard also highlighted the outstanding leadership of \u201cA-rated\u201d senators including Sens. Steve Daines (R-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Martha McSally (R-AZ), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), David Perdue (R-GA), James Inhofe (R-OK), James Risch (R-ID), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Shelley Capito (R-WV).\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nIssues\n\nPro-Life\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nCapital\nCoast\nDelta\nEast Central\nGolden Triangle\nNorth Mississippi\nPine Belt\nSouthwest\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\u00a0E-NEWSLETTER\nFirst Name:*\n\nLast Name:*\n\nEmail Address:*\n\nAddress:\n\nCity:\n\nState:\n\nZip:\n\n\n* indicates a required field.\nBy completing this form, you are authorizing us to send regular e-mail updates to your e-mail account.\nIN THE NEWS\n\n\n\nSenators press for AEWR freeze\nKatie Britt Predicts GOP Senate Majority Next Year, Movement on Protecting Women\u2019s Sports\nRepublicans Block Bogus Democrat IVF Bill That Would Allow Destroying Human Embryos\n\n\n\n\nRECENT RELEASES\n\n\n\nHYDE-SMITH, COLLEAGUES CHALLENGE UNLAWFUL FCC \u2018DIGITAL EQUITY\u2019 RULES\u00a0\nHYDE-SMITH HAILS VICTORY FOR U.S. CATFISH PRODUCERS AS COMMERCE DEPT.
