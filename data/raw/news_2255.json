This year, Trump became the first president to speak at the divisive anti-abortion March for Life, where he called himself the \u201cmost pro-life president\u201d ever.Now, anti-abortion organizations are increasingly turning to Pence\u2019s daughter, 26-year-old Bond, to appeal to young people, who is wading into one of America\u2019s most long-running and contentious culture war issues in spite of describing herself as \u201cnot very political\u201d.\u201cI personally don\u2019t believe abortion should be legal,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview. But, she added, \u201cI\u2019m not a politician.\u201dIf you are familiar with Bond, it is probably through a popular series of children\u2019s books about her pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo. She writes the books with her mother, the second lady Karen Pence, who also illustrates various scenes of Bundo\u2019s life in Washington DC in watercolors.Until recently, Bond was a student at Harvard Divinity School, but said she took a break to get married. In that time, she has moved to Visalia, California, 200 miles north-east of Los Angeles with her husband, and found a new interest in speaking to anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ groups.\u201cI joke with people that I\u2019m really not very political, which everybody says, \u2018You know, you\u2019re in the wrong family for that,\u2019\u201d she said.View image in fullscreenMike and Charlotte Pence in April 2017. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP via Getty ImagesThis might seem incongruous \u2013 abortion and LGBTQ+ rights are two culture war issues regularly used to rile American voters. But in Bond\u2019s world, opposition to abortion and gay marriage is indeed not political. It is de facto.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a time that I considered being pro-choice,\u201d said Bond.Her speaking career has become busy lately. She took top billing at the 2020 Students for Life summit in January, a paid engagement according to the group. The theme of the meeting was \u201cHistory Maker: Casting a Vision for a Post-Roe America\u201d, referring to the landmark Roe v Wade supreme court decision that made abortion legal in the US. She headlined the youth rally at the March for Life, the nation\u2019s largest anti-abortion protest held in the nation\u2019s capitol each January since 1973.Bond is now represented by Greater Talent Network, a speaking agency which also represents the Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin, and for whom she was once an intern. She joined their speaker roster roughly one year ago.But despite her public speaking, untangling Pence\u2019s beliefs on abortion is not easy. Asked whether she supported greater access to birth control, which could help reduce unplanned pregnancies and thus abortion, Bond said: \u201cThere honestly are a lot of different options. And I think that that\u2019s really for policymakers to decide on and frankly offer. And I think that there\u2019s been some progress on that.\u201dI just personally don\u2019t believe that abortion and the culture of a pro-choice culture is pro-womanIn fact, just one of Trump and Pence\u2019s policies alone, the Global Gag Rule which blocks foreign aid from reproductive health organizations which offer abortion, could lead to an estimated 1.8m unintended pregnancies, 600,000 unsafe abortions and 4,600 avoidable maternal deaths, according to Marie Stopes International.But access to birth control has always been contentious in America, and other family members of the Trump-Pence administration have gotten behind paid maternity leave. But even this, Bond said, she was unsure about.\u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll run for office and I\u2019ll have a whole plan about it that I\u2019ll be happy to talk to you about,\u201d she said. Pressed on the matter, Bond said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I really have too much of an opinion on that right now that I\u2019d like to speak openly about.\u201dBond, like her evangelical Christian father, said she wants to encourage young anti-abortion activists to find reasons outside of faith for their opposition to abortion. But what are hers?\u201cAfter doing a lot of research on my own on this topic, I just personally don\u2019t believe that abortion and the culture of a pro-choice culture is pro-woman,\u201d she said, and pointed to \u201cpost-abortion stress syndrome.\u201d The condition, not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association or the American Psychological Association, is said to be similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Anti-abortion advocates have long alleged there are deleterious mental health effects stemming from abortions. But even high-powered abortion opponents, such as Reagan-era surgeon general C Everett Koop, have concluded psychological impacts of abortion are \u201cminuscule\u201d from a public health perspective.I don\u2019t think there was a time that I considered being pro-choice.A recent survey of more than 650 women across 21 US states and five years found 95% believed they made the right decision to have an abortion. The survey buttresses previous research with the same results.The difficulty of Bond\u2019s public statements, is they often conflict with the values of organizations she spends her time with. Her Bundo books, for example, were memorably trolled by comedian John Oliver on the HBO show Last Week Tonight. The show made a parody version of her book in which Bundo meets another boy bunny, and they get married \u2013 a finger in the eye to the Pence family and their work in opposition to gay rights.The proceeds from Oliver\u2019s book benefit gay rights charities. Bond bought a copy when it was published, saying she was, \u201chappy to support charities and important causes\u201d.But when she appeared at the Students for Life summit, she was speaking at an event one of whose sponsors was the American Family Association, whose work focuses on combatting the \u201cgay agenda\u201d. The hate-tracking organization Southern Poverty Law Center describes AFA\u2019s work as \u201cpublicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them\u201d.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Pence with her parents and the Trump family at the Republican national convention on 21 July 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty ImagesIn the time since the Oliver book, Karen Pence also took a teaching position at the Immanuel Christian school in Springfield, Virginia. The school bans gay students and teachers. A former student at the school described it in an op-ed as a \u201chotbed of right-wing fanaticism, shoved down the throats of impressionable children at every turn\u201d.\u201cPeople, I think, will panic a little bit when they hear of abortion being illegal because it reminds people of a time when abortion was illegal by different states,\u201d said Bond, about the time before the 1973 Roe decision.\u201cI think on the policy side allowing states to decide on what they want their limits to be would be a good thing,\u201d she said.Effectively, that would lead to perhaps as many as two dozen states moving forward with abortion bans, and leave vast swaths of America without this reproductive healthcare. \u201cBut I\u2019m not, you know, a politician,\u201d she adds. This article was amended on 18 February 2020 to reflect the American Family Association was a sponsor not an organizer of the Students for Life summit. The year of the summit was also corrected to 2020, from 2019.Explore more on these topicsAbortionMike PenceWomenUS politicsLGBTQ+ rightsHealthWomen's healthinterviewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
