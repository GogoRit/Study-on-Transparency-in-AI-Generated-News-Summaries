Rep.-elect Kat Cammack, the youngest\u00a0GOP congresswoman elected this year, said she plans to fight for the rights of unborn babies --\u00a0just\u00a0like her\u00a0mother fought to keep her.\u00a0    Cammack, newly elected to represent Florida's 3rd Congressional District, said her mother suffered a stroke at age 27 when pregnant with her sister\u00a0and faced a long recovery of learning to walk again. Doctors warned she wouldn't survive\u00a0another pregnancy.So when her mom,\u00a0Ginny,\u00a0got\u00a0pregnant six years later\u00a0with Cammack, doctors recommended an abortion because she was putting her life at risk. Cammack's grandmother also begged her mom to abort her, she said.  GEORGIA REP.-ELECT CAROLYN BOURDEAUX, ONLY DEMOCRAT TO FLIP SEAT, SAYS PARTY SHOULD TALK TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS  \"My mom chose life, which was very difficult for my family,\" Cammack, 32, said in an interview with Fox News, noting that her single mom beat the odds with a healthy\u00a0pregnancy and birth.  \"For\u00a0her to make that choice against the advice of her doctors and against the urging of her own family, that's pretty powerful. So for me, that's why I am personally pro-life.\"Cammack says\u00a0abortion should only be allowed in extreme cases in the first trimester--such as rape or incest reported to law enforcement, and for the life of the mother. Still, she hopes women in those circumstances would not abort their babies, like her mother chose not to.  Cammack is a former congressional aide who will\u00a0succeed her\u00a0boss, Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla. She won a 10-way primary in the red Gainesville area district by\u00a0running as a pro-gun, pro-law enforcement, pro-Trump\u00a0and\u00a0pro-life constitutional conservative.REP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT PLANS THANKSGIVING 'FUNERAL' FOR DEAD TURKEY IN DEFIANCE OF COLORADO GUIDELINES  She intends to use the platform of her office\u00a0to encourage other women to choose life. She will share her personal story in a speech on the House floor at some point and will call out the \"hypocrisy\" of government.    \"We'll\u00a0classify bacteria on Mars as life but we won't classify a heartbeat\u00a0in the womb as life,\" Cammack said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Or if you look at the DOJ [Justice Department], if a pregnant woman is murdered, it's a double homicide. But if the woman chooses to terminate that pregnancy, it's not. It's very hypocritical from the government standpoint. As\u00a0a federal representative coming in, I want to address that hypocrisy in our government.\"  Rep.-elect Kat Cammack, R-Fla., is in Washington for new member orientation. (Marisa Schultz/Fox News) She's\u00a0backed\u00a0by a record number of like-minded Republican\u00a0women. The camaraderie and energy among the 18 new GOP congresswomen were on display in matters big and small. When Cammack's curling iron broke in Washington, D.C., during freshman orientation, she was on a group chat of new friends who could lend her one in a pinch.\u00a0\u00a0ASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS \u2014 NOT TO 'LAUNCH FIREBOMBS' IN CONGRESS    \"We have incredible women that are powerhouses in their own right ...\u00a0whether we were in Congress together or not I would want to be friends with them,\" she said.\u00a0Personal tragedy got Cammack\u00a0interested in conservative politics.Her\u00a0grandmother and mom owned a commercial sandblasting business in Colorado and she intended to be a third-generation sandblaster. But the business struggled and then they\u00a0lost the\u00a0small cattle ranch where the family lived in Colorado, she said. Cammack and her mom lived in an extended stay motel for four months, she said, at a cost of $127 a week.  Cammack blames the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) that was designed to prevent foreclosures for the loss of their ranch. The experience\u00a0sparked her political career.\u00a0    \"In 2011, we lost our cattle ranch to an Obama-era housing program,\" Cammack said. \"[That] was a\u00a0surreal experience being homeless. You just never picture yourself landing there, but us along with 7 million other people lost our homes under that program, and as each day went by, I got more and more incensed about big government.\"REP.-ELECT DIANA HARSHBARGER SAYS CONGRESS IS NO MATCH 'FOR A WOMAN WHO CAN MULTITASK'  Cammack was friends with\u00a0Yoho's nephew and welcomed the\u00a0opportunity to work for his congressional campaign. She\u00a0packed up her car in Colorado\u00a0and moved across the country for Yoho's first campaign and then joined Yoho's congressional staff as deputy chief of staff. She later started her own political and media consulting businesses\u00a0and got married to her husband, Matt, a SWAT medic.Along the way, she said she saved money for a house down payment and moved her mom from Colorado to Florida. Cammack gets tearful\u00a0talking about how her mom has been able to cherish\u00a0her success.  \"She's really proud,\" said Cammack, wiping away tears.\u00a0  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"Only in\u00a0America, and a free constitutional republic, can you go from homeless to the House of Representatives in less than a decade,\" she added. \"That's only possible in America.\"  Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.
