His idea was to develop Pregnant and Parenting Resources pamphlets that list out the campus resources available to them at Boston College. The group has printed over 500 pamphlets and will distribute them all over campus in the coming weeks!\u00a0\n \nMax shared:\n\u201cLast semester, during \u2018Celebrate Life Week\u2019, my Students for Life group, the Boston College Pro-Life Club, hosted a \u2018Pregnant and Parenting Resource Forum\u2019 facilitated by Feminists\u00a0For\u00a0Life\u2019s Joyce McCauley-Benner. In what became\u00a0in all likelihood\u00a0the last official in-person event of the school year, the E-Board, club members, and other interested students learned about an overwhelming amount of existing supportive resources on campus. Boston College offers significant support, including free pregnancy testing, conversations with our pregnancy support advocates, note-taking assistance, among other resources. Yet they are not readily visible on campus.\u00a0\nThough Boston College already had a page on their website showcasing its resources, we\u00a0made a plan to help make these more visible by designing a guide for navigating pregnancy and parenthood at Boston College. Annemarie Arnold, the club president, and Isabel Wagner, our club social media director, designed the top-notch \u2018Pregnant and Parenting Resources\u2019 pamphlets, and Max coordinated with relevant offices on campus, including the Women\u2019s Center, University Health Services, Campus Ministry, among others, to get approval, update information and ensure that they would display our pamphlets.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0  \n\u00a0\nThe pamphlets are professional and beautifully-designed. Said the group\u2019s social media director, Isabel Wagner:\n\u201cI had no idea the resources available on and off campus for pregnant and parenting students, and I\u2019m sure most other students are the same, which is a frightening thought. After all, what good are these resources if nobody knows about them or utilizes them? I feel better now, because no matter how many students pick up and read a pamphlet, it\u2019s comforting to know that there are just a few more students equipped with knowledge to help a future friend or classmate in need.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Boston College Pro-Life Club will feature these pamphlets at tabling events on campus and hope to add more resources to these pamphlets as\u00a0they\u00a0dialogue and coordinate with the university administration in the future!\u00a0\nYou can support pregnant and parenting students this year, too, by participating in our National Holiday Baby Item Drive.
