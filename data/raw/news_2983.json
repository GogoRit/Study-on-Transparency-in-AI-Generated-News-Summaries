On average, he drops three to four episodes per week. For context, his audience outpaces his closest media competitor\u2014Tucker Carlson\u2014by nearly 8 million listens per episode. He\u2019s unrivaled. Any person with something to say would love the chance to say it on his podcast and to his audience.\nNow, picture yourself sitting in Rogan\u2019s studio, where you\u2019ve watched or listened to some of the most influential people in the world talk for hours with him, and you\u2019re in the guest seat directly across from him. The conversation suddenly turns to the subject of abortion. Does the thought make you panic?\nThis is precisely what happened on a recent episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d when Seth Dillon, the CEO of The Babylon Bee, sat across from the pro-abortion Rogan. The conversation turned to abortion, and these two men, with clearly opposing views, began to spar. Rogan\u2019s words and tone initially contained more emotional bite than Dillon\u2019s. As the conversation progressed, however, it was apparent that Dillon\u2019s responses were more cogent and reasoned than Rogan\u2019s. Go to Twitter to see a viral clip of the exchange.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to tell my 14-year-old daughter she has to carry her rapist\u2019s baby. You understand that?\u201d Rogan began. The statement was pointed, and the added question charged it with intensity. The tone sounded like the countless thousands of conversations that transpire on this topic, most usually spiraling downhill from there.\nBut Dillon, still relaxed in his chair, responds, \u201cI don\u2019t think two wrongs make a right. I don\u2019t think murder fixes a rape.\u201d He never raised his voice or sounded defensive.\nRogan then pivoted to the gestational stage of the fetus as an argument for abortion. Dillon tried to answer as Rogan kept repeating the question but succinctly and calmly gave his position, \u201cIt is wrong to intentionally to kill an innocent human life. Abortion intentionally kills an innocent human life. Therefore, abortion is wrong.\u201d The logical syllogism provided an air-tight clarity to his position. Rogan would need to disprove one of the premises of his argument to defeat it.\nDillon continued his answer, anticipating the line of argumentation Rogan\u2019s questions were leading, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any of the examples of \u2018how developed is it,\u2019 \u2018can it think,\u2019 \u2018is it conscious,\u2019 \u2018can it dream,\u2019 \u2018can it feel pain\u2019\u2026\u201d Rogan cut him off, \u201cSo for you it\u2019s the moment of conception?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf it\u2019s a human life, a distinct human life, I think it\u2019s wrong to end its life,\u201d Dillon answered.\nRogan kept inquiring, \u201cDo you think once the conception happens, there\u2019s some sort of miraculous event?\u201d\n\nThis unwillingness to cower under Rogan\u2019s initial aggressiveness or towering platform, while calmly delivering cogent arguments makes Dillon\u2019s position appealing to listeners.\nDillon responded, \u201cWell, I mean, at some point, you\u2019re going to have to say there was a magic moment that happens because you believe we eventually become valuable humans, right? Where\u2019s the moment where you think the magic happens?\u201d Dillon flips the question back on Rogan, forcing him to account for his belief in human value. This is a classic example of making one\u2019s sparring partner confess their underlying assumptions. Dillon knows Rogan values human life, so he must think something magical happens at some point to bestow that value. Dillon pressed Rogan to state when that threshold is and why that threshold would not also apply to the unborn. This unwillingness to cower under Rogan\u2019s initial aggressiveness or towering platform, while calmly delivering cogent arguments makes Dillon\u2019s position appealing to listeners.\nThe first questions from Rogan started aggressively, but unlike most abortion conversations between two people with differing views, the conversation de-escalated as it progressed. Eventually, Dillon made the point that it is blatant misinformation to call abortion \u201chealthcare\u201d when it is the literal killing of human life and equivalent to calling rape \u201clove-making.\u201d The illustration landed with force. Rogan\u2019s entire posture changed by the end of the exchange, and he said, \u201cThis is why it is such a human issue because I see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\u201cI see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d This is a stunning statement when compared to Rogan\u2019s opening remarks. It is unlikely that Rogan left the conversation identifying as a pro-life supporter, but Dillon\u2019s responses landed. Rogan has something to think about the next time he considers trotting out the typical pro-abortion arguments. Dillon models a needed Christian approach. \nThese exchanges aren\u2019t going away in a post-Roe world. Seth Dillon offered a helpful example for Christians to admire\u2014giving calm, reasoned answers that show the superiority of the pro-life worldview. The next time you find yourself in the hot seat across from an ideological opponent about abortion, remember this exchange. Imitate the tactics Dillon employed to present the Christian position on abortion in a Christian way\u2014and do so with clarity, courage, and calmness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErik Reed\nErik Reed is the lead pastor of The Journey Church in Lebanon, Tenn.
