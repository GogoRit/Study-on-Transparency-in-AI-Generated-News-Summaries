Wade, 25 million women live in states with abortion bans or restrictions\nPolitics\n\n\n                                Jun 22, 2023 8:07 PM EDT\n            \n\n\n\nOne year ago Saturday, the U.S. Supreme Court rescinded\u00a0a five-decade-old right to abortion,\u00a0prompting a\u00a0seismic shift\u00a0in debates about politics, values, freedom and fairness.\nTwenty-five million women of childbearing age now live in\u00a0states where the law makes abortions harder to get\u00a0than they were before the ruling.\nDecisions about the law are largely in the hands of state lawmakers and courts. Most Republican-led states have restricted abortion. Fourteen ban abortion in most cases at any point in pregnancy. Twenty Democratic-leaning states have protected access to abortion.\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s changed since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling.\nLaws have been enacted in 25 states to ban or restrict abortion access\nLast summer, as women and medical providers\u00a0began to navigate\u00a0a landscape without legal protection for abortion, Nancy Davis\u2019 doctors advised her to terminate her pregnancy. The fetus she was carrying had no skull and was expected to die soon after birth.\nBut doctors in Louisiana, where Davis lived, would not provide the abortion due to a new law banning it throughout pregnancy in most cases.\nDavis became one of the women whose stories, told on news sites and network news, in newspapers and blogs,\u00a0illustrated the shifting ground\u00a0doctors and their patients tried to navigate.\nAt the same time, abortion opponents who worked for decades to abolish a practice they see as murder cheered the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling. Anti-abortion groups said\u00a0the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling\u00a0that legalized abortion nationwide was undemocratic because it prevented states from enacting bans.\n\u201cThe Dobbs decision was a democratic victory for life that generations fought for,\u201d said E.V. Osment, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a major anti-abortion group.\nWhile some states scrambled to pass new restrictions, others already had enacted laws that were designed to take effect if the court overturned Roe.\nMore than 25 million women ages 15 to 44, or about 2 in 5 nationally, now live in states where there are more restrictions on abortion access than there were before Dobbs. More than 5.5 million more live in states where restrictions have been adopted but are on hold pending court challenges. Bans on abortion no later than 12 weeks into pregnancy are on the books in nearly every state in the Southeast \u2014 though some are not in effect.\nMany laws that make exceptions for medical emergencies do not clearly define those situations. After Davis went public with her challenges last year,\u00a0Louisiana lawmakers debated\u00a0whether doctors in the state were right to deny her an abortion under a law that has exceptions for \u201cmedically futile\u201d pregnancies and when there\u2019s a substantial risk of death or impairment for the woman. But the Legislature made no changes to clarify the law.\nDavis is among a number of women who ended up traveling out of state to have a legal surgical abortion. She got help from a fund that raises money for women to travel for such purposes.\nWith her fianc\u00e9 by her side, Davis flew to New York in September, when she was about four months pregnant. The whole experience was heartbreaking, she said.\n\u201cA mother\u2019s love starts as soon as she knows she\u2019s pregnant. That attachment starts instantly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was days I couldn\u2019t sleep. It was days I couldn\u2019t eat.\u201d\nAbortion access has been protected in 20 states\nAs some states restricted abortion, others locked in access. Clinics moved across state lines, added staff and lengthened hours to accommodate women leaving their home states to end their pregnancies.\nIn 25 states, abortion remains generally legal up to at least 24 weeks of pregnancy. In 20 of those states, protections have been solidified through constitutional amendments or laws. Officials in many of those states, including\u00a0California,\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0Minnesota,\u00a0New Mexico\u00a0and\u00a0New York, have explicitly invited women from places where the procedure is banned.\nWomen have flocked to states with legal access.\nCHOICES Center for Reproductive Health had for decades treated patients in Memphis, Tennessee, some seeking abortions. After Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban kicked in last year, the clinic opened a second outpost that\u2019s about a three-hour drive away, in Carbondale, Illinois, a state that has positioned itself as\u00a0an oasis for abortion access.\nREAD MORE: Nevada Republican governor enshrines abortion protections\n\u201cI would say 80% or more of our patients continue to come from the communities that CHOICES has always taken care of,\u201d said CEO Jennifer Pepper, who said the Illinois clinic sees on average 350 patients a month. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and even Texas, but now they\u2019re having to travel much farther.\u201d\nKansas is one of the closest places to obtain abortions for people in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. A new clinic opened in Kansas City, Kansas, four days before Dobbs. Within weeks, the clinic was overwhelmed. Even after lengthening hours, hiring staff and flying in physicians, it\u2019s been able to take only about 10% to 15% of people who have sought an abortion there.\nDr. Iman Alsaden, the Planned Parenthood medical director based in Kansas, said most patients in the Kansas clinics are now coming from elsewhere.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a really, really dire public health situation when you are looking at someone who had to jump through endless amounts of hoops just to make this work and saying they\u2019re so lucky they\u2019re able to do this,\u201d Alsaden said.\nIn anticipation of out-of-state patients, states such as Hawaii have passed laws to allow more health care workers, such as nurse practitioners, to provide abortions. In New Jersey, officials late last year announced a grant to train more medical professionals to perform the procedures.\nThe number of abortions is not clear\nBecause of reporting lags and gaps in data, the impact on the number of abortions provided across the U.S. is not completely clear. But the authors of #WeCount, a survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit organization that promotes research and supports abortion access, say the monthly average went down after Dobbs.\nThe group\u2019s data finds that the number of abortions provided through clinics, hospitals and other providers in states where bans were put in place plummeted to nearly zero. The tracking effort collects monthly data, providing a snapshot of abortion trends after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It does not reflect self-managed abortions, relies on estimates in places where providers do not supply data and does not fully account for seasonal differences in pregnancies or abortions.\nStill, it\u2019s the fullest national picture available for now. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data covering 2022 is not likely to be released until late 2024. Even then, the picture won\u2019t be completely clear: Not every state collects abortion data, and what is collected does not include self-managed abortions provided outside clinics, hospitals and doctor\u2019s offices.\nREAD MORE: More women who were denied abortions in Texas join lawsuit challenging state\u2019s abortion law\nIn Louisiana, where abortion was legal until 22 weeks\u2019 gestational age before Dobbs, the state reported more than 7,400 abortions in 2020, the last year for which full data was available. #WeCount found there were an average of 785 a month in April and May 2022 \u2014 and fewer than 10 every month since the ban there has been in place.\nThere are similar trends elsewhere. In\u00a0Idaho,\u00a01,700 abortions were reported in 2020, and #WeCount found fewer than 10 a month recently.\u00a0In Texas,\u00a0state data shows only a handful of abortions monthly from August through January. Before restrictions there took effect in 2021, there were often more than 5,000 per month.\nThe #WeCount survey of abortion providers has found that the overall average number of abortions at clinics and hospitals was lower in the months after the Dobbs ruling, from July 2022 through March but that the number of abortions has risen dramatically in states that border those with no access, such as Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico and North Carolina. In Illinois, for instance, the survey tallied about 5,600 abortions in April 2022 and more than 7,900 in March 2023.\nPills are an even more dominant abortion method\nEven before the court ruled, most abortions in the U.S. were done through\u00a0a two-pill regimen, not a surgical procedure. Now groups are using medication to provide access \u2014 however illegal \u2014 in states where abortion is banned.\nFor example, Aid Access works with doctors overseas and in states with shield laws, which are intended to bar abortion-related investigations by other states. Those doctors prescribe the medications and Aid Access ships them. It saw requests in a sample of 30 states more than double from before a draft of the Dobbs ruling was leaked last year until it became official and bans started taking effect.\nThe group\u2019s Netherlands-based founder and director, Rebecca Gomperts, believes most U.S. women who want abortions are still managing to get them.\n\u201cThe fact that the abortion pill is available,\u201d she said, \u201cthat makes the tragic of it much less profound.\u201d\nStill, she said, those who struggle the most for access are poor and Black women.\nThe move from surgical to medication abortion has frustrated abortion opponents, who have taken their case to court. Some abortion opponents are calling for the abortion drug mifepristone to lose its 23-year-old approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0has preserved access for now.\nSome states are increasing support for moms and children\nOne ripple from overturning Roe in conservative states has been a new willingness to adopt measures such as improving foster care and benefits for postpartum women.\nMississippi,\u00a0where the Dobbs case originated,\u00a0is a key example. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed off on several proposals that he deemed as the \u201cnext phase\u201d of the \u201cpro-life agenda.\u201d This included expanding a tax credit from $3.5 million a year to $10 million a year for people or businesses who donate to anti-abortion centers, which provide diapers, clothing and other assistance for pregnant women and have been accused of\u00a0providing misleading information\u00a0to steer women away from abortion. He also approved creating an income tax credit of up to $10,000 for adopting a child who lives in Mississippi and $5,000 for a adopting a child from outside the state.\nWATCH: What\u2019s behind a sharp rise in deaths among pregnant women and new mothers?\nHe also agreed to extend Medicaid health insurance coverage for lower-income women until a year after they give birth, rather than just two months.\nThe state\u2019s two Catholic bishops sent a letter to lawmakers and Reeves in February calling for the Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cThis they felt was consistent with the intent of Dobbs,\u201d Jackson Bishop Joseph Kopacz said in an interview, \u201csaying that it can\u2019t stop at birth.\u201d\nFor Shannon Bagley, the executive director of the Center for Pregnancy Choices, an anti-abortion center just outside Jackson that will benefit from the expanded tax credit, said it\u2019s offering more parenting classes and focusing on helping eligible women sign up for Medicaid, job search assistance and offering donated car seats, cribs and other baby items.\n\u201cThis is a new era and we\u2019re going to have to be more and we\u2019re going to have to do more,\u201d she said.\nLawsuits abound\nIn conservative Utah, a ban on abortions throughout pregnancy took effect almost immediately after the Dobbs ruling. But the next day, the state\u2019s Planned Parenthood affiliate challenged the law, saying it violated the state constitution.\nA judge put the ban on hold while the case works its way through the courts.\nIt\u2019s one of more than 50 lawsuits filed on abortion policy since the Dobbs ruling. Lawsuits have been the foundation of the abortion debate for decades, but now the burden is on abortion-rights advocates to prove that restrictions are too harsh, rather than on anti-abortion groups to prove they are justified.\nMany challenges rely on arguments about the rights to\u00a0personal autonomy\u00a0or\u00a0religious freedom. A Texas lawsuit alleges women were denied abortions even when\u00a0their lives were at risk.\nREAD MORE: America\u2019s religious leaders sharply divided over abortion, a year after Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal\nBans or restrictions are on hold in at least six states while judges sort out their long-term fate. The only states where a top court has permanently rejected restrictions since the Dobbs ruling are\u00a0Iowa\u00a0and\u00a0South Carolina. In the latter, lawmakers later adopted a new ban, but\u00a0enforcement is on hold\u00a0due to a court challenge.\nIn Utah, lawmakers this year passed a first-in-the-nation law banning abortion clinics. But a\u00a0judge put enforcement of that on hold, too, while the court case plays out.\nCriminal courts have not been busy with abortion cases\nThere\u2019s little evidence that doctors, women, or those who help them get abortions are being prosecuted.\nIn Mississippi, the state attorney general\u2019s office says no charges have been brought under a new law that calls for up to 10 years in prison for anyone who provides or attempts to provide an abortion in cases where it wasn\u2019t to save the woman\u2019s life or to end a pregnancy caused by rape or incest.\nProgressive\u00a0prosecutors across the country, including in states with bans, have said that they would not pursue abortion-related cases, or that they would make them a low priority. One in Florida was\u00a0suspended from his job\u00a0for it by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nJames Bopp Jr., general counsel to the National Right to Life committee, finds it troubling that prosecutors would not pursue abortion cases. He said it\u2019s a change from the era before Roe v. Wade, when most states restricted abortion.\n\u201cThey were going to enforce the laws; there was no question they were going to do that,\u201d Bopp said. \u201cThat was their obligation.\u201d\nLegislative efforts to classify abortion as homicide or murder in South Carolina,\u00a0Kentucky\u00a0and\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0also have sputtered.\n\u201cThe question about punishing the pregnant person is going to become the existential question in the anti-abortion movement,\u201d said Greer Donley, an abortion law expert and associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\nBut Bopp said prominent anti-abortion groups like his oppose such measures. He said women who pursue abortions are \u201cvictims of the abortion culture, victims of men, particularly wealthy men.\u201d\nAbortion remains a dominant political issue\nThe political table has been reset, with Republicans entering a new election season weighing how to balance\u00a0the interests of a base\u00a0that wants the strictest bans possible against the desires of the broader electorate.\nPolling has consistently found that most Americans think abortions should be available in at least some circumstances, including early in a pregnancy, but that most also favor restrictions later in a pregnancy. Polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found that the majority opposed banning abortion in the first six weeks of pregnancy, but most also favor barring abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Only six states have no limit, and abortion is rare after 21 weeks.\nWATCH: Indiana doctor reprimanded for speaking about abortion provided to 10-year-old rape victim\nLast year, voters sided with abortion-rights advocates in\u00a0all six states\u00a0with abortion-related ballot measures, including in generally conservative Kansas and Kentucky. The issue was also a major factor in why\u00a0Democrats performed better than expected\u00a0in 2022 elections.\nThere are pushes for ballot measures to protect abortion access in several states, including\u00a0Ohio.\nIn\u00a0Indiana,\u00a0South Carolina\u00a0and\u00a0West Virginia\u00a0\u2014 all states that have adopted bans since Dobbs \u2014 the legislative battles were not between Democrats and Republican over whether to impose restrictions but among Republicans on just how far to go.\nSusan B. Anthony Pro-Life America believes the issue could be a boost for conservatives with the right framing. The group announced this year that it\u2019s\u00a0working with Kellyanne Conway, a former Trump adviser, to \u201cget pro-life candidates on offense in the 2024 election cycle.\u201d\nProgressives worry about other rights\nAmong advocates on the left, a lot of alarm bells rang over\u00a0Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 concurring opinion\u00a0in Dobbs. \u201cWe should reconsider all of this Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents,\u201d including cases that found married people have the right to obtain contraceptives, people can engage in private, consensual sex acts and the right to same-sex marriage, Thomas wrote.\nREAD MORE: Here are the restrictions on transgender people that are moving through U.S. statehouses\nSo far, measures on those areas have not gained traction. State legislation on contraceptives has aimed only to guarantee or protect access to it, and President Joe Biden last year signed\u00a0a law to safeguard same-sex marriage.\nInstead, Republican lawmakers in many states focused in 2023 on\u00a0restricting gender-affirming care, especially for transgender minors.\nMulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Kruesi from Nashville and Savage from Chicago. Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights activists rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. on April 15, 2023.
