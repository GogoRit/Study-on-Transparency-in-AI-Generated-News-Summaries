Russo case on March 4, 2020 in Washington, DC. The Louisiana abortion case was the first major abortion case to make it to the Supreme Court after Donald Trump became was elected. On June 29, the court voted 5-4 to overturn the Louisiana law.

The majority ruled that Louisiana\u2019s law was essentially identical to a Texas law the court struck down in 2016. The court also ruled that Louisiana providers can go to court to defend the rights and dignity of their patients; who are often unable to do it themselves.\nThe Supreme Court upheld what many of us already knew: abortion admitting privileges mandates are unconstitutional and add no benefit to patient safety.\nAbortions are safer than colonoscopies and wisdom tooth extraction, and only 0.11 percent of patients need hospitalization afterward. Also, in 2017, fewer than 0.3 percent of Louisianians sought abortion care.\nOnly a small portion of pregnancies end with abortion, and it\u2019s a beautiful reality that some folks who get pregnant and give birth have healthy experiences. However, it\u2019s not true of all pregnancy outcomes. Death from pregnancy, death from labor, infant mortality, miscarriage due to natural causes and our toxic environment make up a substantial portion of pregnancy experiences in Louisiana.\nMany Louisiana lawmakers have created policies that are hostile toward their own geographic, religious and social communities. These lawmakers believe we should jump through hoops to be treated fairly, and, as their criticisms of the Supreme Court ruling shows, they are vocal about their plans to keep drafting such legislation and not widen the scope of people they consider when drafting these policies.\nLouisiana wasted millions on litigation to crumble our right to health and individual dignity, and even now, in the face of a pandemic, those lawmakers seem unable to focus on the actual issues confronting Louisiana. We all see how deeply impacted we are by unforeseen circumstances, like COVID-19, and we must admit we have a state in need of a priorities overhaul and a far more sustainable budget.\nMoney, resources, and energy used to oppress the most marginalized in our state could have gone and can still go toward measures to ensure our success.\nThat energy and money could have helped municipalities and parishes across the state take care of their residents. Louisiana students\u00a0 have been forced to take classes from home. Imagine lawmakers spending similar energy\u00a0 on helping students in a state with the lowest home internet rates.What could that kind of tenacity bring to our fractured state healthcare system and all those that rely on it?\nDespite there being no shortage of causes to champion that positively impact the state of Louisiana, many of our legislators are obsessed with oppressing and weakening communities across the state.\nAccording to Louisiana\u2019s constitution, a government\u2019s\u00a0 \u201conly legitimate ends are to secure justice for all, protect peace, protect the rights, and promote the happiness and general welfare of the people.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, in November, Louisianians will be asked to vote on a constitutional amendment that says \u201cnothing in the constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\u201d That amendment aims to remove the peace, rights, happiness, and general welfare of our families, neighbors, and friends. It would explicitly deny abortion as a right and would ensure it\u2019s not funded by the state; though abortion is not funded by Louisiana now.\nThis amendment stands in opposition to the already secured rights held in our constitution. Our right to a government that will not sentence pregnant people, especially Black pregnant people, across the state to death.
