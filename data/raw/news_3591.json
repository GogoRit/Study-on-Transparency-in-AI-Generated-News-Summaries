In 2019, state lawmakers passed a law that would ban most abortions at around six-weeks. Riley Bunch/GPB News\n\n\n\n\n\nA new poll released Wednesday shows that a majority of Georgians \u2013 particularly Black voters \u2013 continue to oppose the state\u2019s new restrictive abortion law.\nNearly 62% objected overall, with about 54% saying they strongly opposed it. Black respondents were the most adamantly against it, with 86.4% of them saying they firmly disapprove of the law.\u00a0\nWhen asked how a candidate\u2019s position on abortion would factor into their decision-making at the ballot box, 47% of those surveyed \u2013 including 76% of Black respondents \u2013 said they are more likely to back someone who will protect access.\u00a0\nAbout 29% said they would vote for someone who would restrict access, and about one-fifth of voters surveyed said a candidate\u2019s position on abortion had no bearing on how they will vote this fall.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Georgia Recorder is one of several newsrooms that are part of the Georgia News Collaborative that commissioned this poll from the School of Public and International Affairs Survey Research Center at the University of Georgia.\u00a0\nThe statewide poll surveyed 1,030 likely voters and contains a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\nThe numbers help explain why Georgia Democrats running for statewide office have put abortion access at the center of their campaigns. It also sheds light on why Republican candidates, including some who had a hand in creating Georgia\u2019s 2019 anti-abortion law, have largely stayed mum on the issue.\u00a0\nBut after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and ended the nearly 50-year federal protection of abortion rights, the issue became one of the dominant factors of this year\u2019s midterm election.\u00a0\nAngela Brewington, a 57-year-old software engineer who lives in Henry County, said the state\u2019s abortion law and this year\u2019s permitless carry were her two main beefs with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. She plans to vote for Democrat Stacey Abrams.\u00a0\nBrewington wasn\u2019t opposed to tighter abortion laws in Georgia. The state\u2019s previous ban after about 20 weeks was too late into a pregnancy, she said, mindful of her niece who was born at 22 weeks. But she argues a 12-week ban would be more reasonable than today\u2019s restrictive law, which she says went too far.\u00a0\n\u201cThese are not my views, personally, on abortion of what choices I would make,\u201d Brewington said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that the state has a right to have a six-week ban. You barely know that you\u2019re even pregnant at six weeks.\u201d\u00a0\n  Protesters flooded Liberty Plaza in May after the draft U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\n\u2018Something we need to fight for\u2019\nDemocrats hope anger over Georgia\u2019s new law will mobilize their base and win over some swing voters. They are banking on the tactic even in races \u2013 like the Secretary of State contest \u2013 where the issue may not seem directly connected.\u00a0\nState Rep. Bee Nguyen, an Atlanta Democrat who is challenging Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, has tied abortion access to voting rights.\u00a0\n\u201cWe cannot talk about voting rights without talking about reproductive rights. An attack on one is an attack on another,\u201d Nguyen said in a recent speech.\u00a0\nThe issue is resonating with some voters on the campaign trail, although it remains to be seen if the Democrats\u2019 argument holds enough power to shape the outcome of the midterm elections when economic factors loom large.\u00a0\nMartha Zoller, a conservative activist and board member of the Georgia Life Alliance, a group that advocates for abortion restrictions, said that she believes that Democrats have been \u201ctrying to scare people\u201d with incessant ads about Georgia\u2019s recently implemented abortion law.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this issue is moving people the way the left hoped it would,\u201d she said.\nBut Democrats aren\u2019t just eyeing more independent-minded voters. They are hoping that the hot button issue will turn out left-leaning Georgians who don\u2019t usually engage in partisan politics.\nErica Senegal, who lives in Cobb County, says she has always avoided talking about politics. Whatever opinion she had, she was content expressing it silently with her vote.\u00a0\nBut on a recent Saturday afternoon, the nurse found herself at a Smyrna restaurant with the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jen Jordan, and participating in a roundtable discussion on abortion access. Jordan has said she would not defend the state\u2019s new abortion restrictions if elected.\u00a0\nSenegal said afterwards that it was her first time attending such an event, but it likely won\u2019t be the last. The Supreme Court decision and the implementation of Georgia\u2019s strict anti-abortion law have left her fired up, saying it\u2019s \u201csomething we need to fight for.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are they taking away a woman\u2019s right to her body, regardless of what the reason is,\u201d Senegal said.\u00a0\n  State Sen. Jen Jordan, who is the Democratic nominee for attorney general, speaks at a roundtable discussion about abortion access held last month at Rodney\u2019s Jamaican Soul restaurant in Smyrna. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder\nGOP pushes abortion to background\nVoters said kitchen table issues like the economy and inflation are still top-of-mind when they go to cast ballots in November.\nSusan Hasel, a 36-year-old publication assistant in Walton County who participated in the survey, said she very much backs Georgia\u2019s new abortion restrictions and the narrow exceptions it allows, such as in the case of rape. She also favors candidates who say they will limit abortion access.\u00a0\nStill, Hasel said she doesn\u2019t think the issue of abortion will have a significant impact on the election.\u00a0\n\u201cThis close to Christmas, it\u2019s going to be the economy. 100%,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends that had to get a second job just to make ends meet, and they\u2019re in businesses that pay very well.\u201d\nThe dynamic explains why most Georgia Republicans don\u2019t need to put emphasis on the issue, including Kemp who has said little about the implementation of the state\u2019s strict abortion law.\u00a0\nAlmost immediately after Roe v. Wade was overturned, a federal appeals court ruled the state\u2019s law \u2013 which has been tied up in a legal battle for three years \u2013 could take effect.\u00a0\nWhat on the surface seems like an easy campaign talking point for Kemp has been left out of his stump speeches \u2013 even at a conservative Christian conference in Atlanta, where attendees were overjoyed that the law passed.\nExperts say Republicans like Kemp are also likely wary that the crackdown on abortion will push some of the more moderate voters in their party away.\nOne such voter is Scott Davenport, who on a recent Saturday morning was doing some gardening in his East Cobb neighborhood with his wife, Lisa.\nThe pair has lived in the heart of the suburban county for more than 30 years and when they first moved in all their neighbors were Republicans. Now, Davenport said, more than half are likely Democrats.\nDavenport was a lifelong Republican, too, until President Donald Trump took office. Now, he said, he doesn\u2019t align with the party\u2019s \u201cnegativity\u201d and what he called a stray from core GOP principles like limited government \u2013 particularly with abortion, although he is an opponent.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Republican position has always been individual rights,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can be pro-choice and I can be pro-life. And that\u2019s okay. You have the right to choose that. And so I don\u2019t understand how they want more government in the bedroom, but less government everywhere else.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd for me, when they don\u2019t have exceptions for rape and incest, the life of the mother, when they\u2019re forcing 10-year-old girls who are raped to have babies, I mean, I\u2019m out. That\u2019s it for me. So, no, they don\u2019t have my vote,\u201d he said.\nThe debate over whether or not there should be abortion exceptions has also played out on the campaign trail. Lawmakers included narrow exceptions in the 2019 bill, such as if the life of the mother is at risk.\u00a0\nBut Republican U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker has said he would support a total ban with no exceptions for rape, incest or a threat to the life of the mother.\nPam Calloway, 55, a receptionist from Fayette County and a poll respondent, strongly opposes abortion and would support a total ban. She said she plans on voting for both Kemp and Walker.\n\u201cAs far as Kemp with the heartbeat law, I fully support it 100%. I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that that has finally found its way.\u201d\n  Gov. Brian Kemp delivers remarks at the Family Research Council\u2019s 2022 Pray Vote Stand for Life Summit. He only briefly mentioned the state\u2019s restrictive abortion law that he signed into law in 2019. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\n\u2018It\u2019s going to take a lot of prayer\u2019\nRecent allegations against senate candidate Herschel Walker have pushed the issue back to the forefront of the campaign cycle. A recent report from The Daily Beast details claims from an ex-girlfriend that Walker paid for her to have an abortion in 2009.\nWalker has adamantly denied the claims even as the news made national headlines.\nZoller said the allegations have renewed the conversation around abortion but it\u2019s too early to tell if it will actually have an impact on Republican voters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are Republicans that are questioning what they\u2019re going to do. But I do think ultimately when they get into the ballot box, that they\u2019re probably going to vote for who is going to vote for their values, which I think would be Herschel Walker.\u201d\u00a0\nSarah Simcox, a 56-year-old kindergarten teacher in Forsyth County, said she is struggling with her decision.\u00a0\n\u201cIf these things are true [about Walker], that\u2019s horrible,\u201d Simcox said. \u201cBut I think politically he might be better [than Warnock]. \u2026 I\u2019m struggling with it. It\u2019s going to take a lot of prayer.\u201d\u00a0\nBut others, like Susan Hasel from Walton County, are unfazed by the news reports.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat he did in the past is in the past. Leave it there. Everybody has a past, and no one\u2019s perfect. And I don\u2019t expect a candidate to be perfect,\u201d Hasel said.\u00a0\nReporter Rebecca Grapevine with Capitol Beat contributed to this story.\u00a0\nThe Georgia News Collaborative represents organizations and individuals with a passion and ability for strengthening local news in Georgia.
