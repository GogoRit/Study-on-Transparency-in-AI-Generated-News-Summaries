The popular lecture tour launches this week at Notre Dame on Tuesday. See tour dates & locations below. Events will be added as confirmed.\n\nA highlight of Hawkins\u2019 events always includes audience engagement where she opens the floor for discussion with those who attend.\nDuring last year\u2019s tour, for example, a\u00a0Boston College student\u00a0argued with Hawkins that a baby is not a baby if someone wanted an abortion.\n\n\u201cDo you think that children that are apprehended at the border that are in U.S. government care\u2026do you think babies who are going to die should be resuscitated\u00a0and given care?\u201d Hawkins asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d the student replied.\n\u201cOkay. Do you believe that a baby who is born alive during an abortion at Planned Parenthood should get care?\u201d Hawkins followed up.\nThe student replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHawkins paused and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\nAs the discussion continued, the student said, \u201cThey were performing an abortion So, before that, they\u2019ve already determined that it\u2019s not a baby.\u201d\nHawkins noted that conversations like the one at Boston College are why she travels to campuses and why the Students for Life of America team will have 250,000 pro-life conversations on college, university, high school, and middle school campuses this year.\nFall 2019 Visit to Cincinnati, OH\n\u201cThe real debate over the abortion issue is not inside the beltway in Washington D.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to talk with the generation targeted by the abortion industry to help them think through how abortion really impacts them.\u201d\nEvents such as Hawkins\u2019 speaking tour often are targeted for protests by pro-abortion activists. Hawkins addressed this in an op-ed at\u00a0Fox News titled, \u201cIf we lose free speech on college and university campuses, we lose America,\u201d in which she wrote:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAmerica will lose its national identity and fundamental freedoms if we don\u2019t fight for free speech on college campuses, where the next generation of leaders must learn to listen to and understand not just the ideas they like, but the ideas held by their fellow citizens, whether they like them or not.\u201d\n\u201cMake Abortion Illegal Again\u201d Tour Dates & Locations\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame, Feb. 25th\nCalifornia Polytechnic University, Feb. 27th\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Mar. 31st\nTowson University, Apr. 1st\nKansas University, Apr. 7th\nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas, Apr. 8th\nIthaca College, Apr. 22nd\nThe University of Toledo, April (TBD)\nWestern Washington, May (TBD)\n\n\n Post Views: 1,732\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
