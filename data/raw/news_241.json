That is a question that motivates a lot of voters,\u201d Fr Pavone said.\nAnti-abortion activists swiftly made clear that Monday\u2019s ruling would not dissuade them from continuing to push tough abortion restrictions through state legislatures.\nIn recent years, several states have enacted near-total bans on abortion only to have them blocked by the courts.\nHowever, Texas Right to Life urged politicians there to press ahead with a proposed three-pronged measure that would start with a ban on late-term abortions and proceed to a total ban.\nMonday\u2019s ruling \u201chighlights the need for pro-life states to pass laws that directly protect pre-born children in new and dynamic ways rather than get distracted on regulating the corrupt abortion industry\u201d, a Texas Right to Life statement said.\n\n\nToday\u2019s decision reaffirmed that states can\u2019t put in place laws that unduly burden a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions\u2014but the fight isn\u2019t over. As President, I\u2019ll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman\u2019s constitutional right to choose. https://t.co/qFrH8hFst8\n\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 29, 2020\n\n\n\nMike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life, questioned the wisdom of pushing now for sweeping bans.\nHe noted that an Ohio bill sharply restricting late-term abortions had taken effect, while the courts blocked a measure passed last year that would ban most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy.\n\u201cWe have to be methodical, strategic, and take an incremental approach,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA lot of people want to go from 0 to 60 \u2014 you usually end up with nothing.\u201d\nThe president of a national anti-abortion group, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, said she and her allies would encourage states to continue pressing forward with proposed restrictions that stopped short of near-total bans.\n\u201cThese measures are extremely popular in some battleground states,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPrioritising them is part of our electoral strategy.\u201d\nPro-choice advocate Nancy Northup, the chief executive of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, acknowledged that Monday\u2019s ruling \u201cwill not stop those hell-bent on banning abortion\u201d.\n\u201cWe will continue to fight state by state, law by law to protect our constitutional right to abortion,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t have to keep playing whack-a-mole.\u201d\nShe urged Congress to pass a bill called The Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which seeks to bolster women\u2019s ability to access abortion even in states that pass laws seeking to restrict that access.\n\n\nAfter today\u2019s disappointing decision by SCOTUS, one thing is clear: We need more Conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. #FourMoreYears\n\u2014 Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) June 29, 2020\n\n\n\nThe measure was introduced in May 2019 and has strong Democratic support but no chance of passage for now due to Republican opposition.\nFrom the other side of the debate, there also are dreams of a congressional solution.\nMichael New, an abortion opponent who teaches social research at Catholic University of America, said some legal experts in the anti-abortion community believe Congress could find ways to restrict or ban abortion while circumventing the courts, for example by establishing constitutional legal protections for unborn children.\nBut any such measures are nonstarters for now, given that Democrats in Congress would overwhelmingly oppose them.\nWhatever the strategy, New said, it would be important for the anti-abortion movement to be unified.\n\n\nThis pro-choice SCOTUS decision (where Chief Justice Roberts sided w/the liberal judges) is the \u201cScalia-moment\u201d of the 2020 election\nConservatives know they are on the one-yard-line\nEnthusiasm is already unprecedented, evangelical turnout will be too. #EvangelicalsForTrump\n\u2014 Rev. Johnnie Moore \u0646 (@JohnnieM) June 29, 2020\n\n\n\nHe recalled that internal debates decades ago over how to draft a human life amendment to the Constitution did a great deal of damage to the anti-abortion cause.\nJohnnie Moore, an evangelical adviser to the Trump administration, said Monday\u2019s court ruling would intensify interest in the election among religious conservatives who are a key part of Mr Trump\u2019s base.\n\u201cConservatives know they are on the one-yard-line,\u201d Mr Moore tweeted.\n\u201cEnthusiasm is already unprecedented, evangelical turnout will be too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\tTrending Stories\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman (69) jailed for setting fire to her curtains in a \u2018cry for help\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIslander found guilty of attacking man with wooden bat\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMan (60) bites arm of store detective\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFraudsters steal more than \u00a32m from Islanders\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolice release image after customer was \"verbally abusive and threatening\" in St Helier shop\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMotion on extension of EU law to Northern Ireland is defeated at Stormont\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJury out in trial of mother accused of murdering toddler\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Drakeford faces his last First Minister\u2019s Questions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVideo shows group trying to stop suspected XL bully during attack\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore UK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRead the latest free supplements\t\t\n\n\t\t\tRead the Town Crier, Le Rocher and a whole host of other subjects like mortgage advice, business, cycling, travel and property.\t\t\nRead More\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a9 2024 Jersey Evening Post.
