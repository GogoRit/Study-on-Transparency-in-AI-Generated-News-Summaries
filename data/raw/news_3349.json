Days earlier, Rubio urged Garland to investigate threats against pro-life organizations. Rubio previously urged Garland to prosecute those intimidating U.S. Supreme Court justices.\u00a0\u201cDespite the damage that has already been done and even though these groups have kept their promise to raise the violent stakes, the DOJ has not been faithful to its promise of ensuring the public\u2019s safety against these violent, radical activists,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cTo date, there has not been a single charge brought against any individual or group despite the countless pro-life centers in America that have been firebombed and vandalized in recent months.\u201d\u00a0The full text of the letter is below.\u00a0\u00a0Dear Attorney General Garland:\u00a0\u00a0I write again to express my concern for the safety of pro-life organizations. As you know, Jane\u2019s Revenge is a left-wing extremist group that has claimed responsibility for several violent attacks on pro-life organizations across the United States. Alarmingly, in the group\u2019s most recent public statement, Jane\u2019s Revenge has now doubled-down on its commitment to violence, threats and intimidation, writing that the \u201cleash is off\u201d and it is now \u201copen season\u201d on any pro-life group that refuses to close their doors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my previous letter dated June 10, 2022, I directed your attention to radical pro-abortion groups, like Jane\u2019s Revenge, that have relentlessly targeted pro-life centers, groups, and churches with acts of arson, vandalism, and violence due to their pro-life views. In the United States, we cannot tolerate groups that openly choose and advocate violent means in order to achieve a desired political end. The most recent statement by Jane\u2019s Revenge makes unmistakably clear that violence will soon follow if the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) does not act accordingly. \u201c[W]e are not merely pushing words,\u201d the group wrote. They further state, \u201c[w]e promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures . . . and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the damage that has already been done and even though these groups have kept their promise to raise the violent stakes, the DOJ has not been faithful to its promise of ensuring the public\u2019s safety against these violent, radical activists. To date, there has not been a single charge brought against any individual or group despite the countless pro-life centers in America that have been firebombed and vandalized in recent months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since my last letter asking that DOJ prosecute and publicly condemn the criminals picketing outside of Justices\u2019 homes, a man traveled from California with the intent to murder of Justice Kavanaugh. In now writing this letter, I fear that if the threats posed by groups like Jane\u2019s Revenge are not taken seriously, I once again will be proven right \u2013 only this time the outcome may not be the same. With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to issue its final decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health at any time, the DOJ and the Biden Administration can no longer remain silent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The DOJ must condemn these groups and prosecute the criminal actors who are conspiring and coordinating a violent campaign against pro-life organizations that refuse to be intimidated into submission. I therefore request answers to the following questions:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIs the DOJ investigating groups, including Jane\u2019s Revenge, and the criminal acts they commit?\u00a0\nHas the DOJ charged any individual or group in connection with the recent attacks on pro-life organizations? If not, why?\u00a0\nAs confirmed at the time by then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, is it still President Biden\u2019s position to \u201cencourage\u201d protests \u201coutside of judges\u2019 homes\u201d?\u00a0\nWill DOJ create a partnership among federal, state, and local law enforcement to address the violence against pro-life organizations as it did when addressing the alleged threats of violence against school-board administrators?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.\u00a0\u00a0Sincerely,\u00a0\nRUBIO PIDE A MERRICK GARLAND QUE ENJUICE A JANE\u2019S REVENGE\n\u00a0Washington, D.C. \u2014 El senador estadounidense Marco Rubio (R-FL) envi\u00f3 una carta al fiscal general de EE.UU. con respecto al grupo violento de izquierda Jane\u2019s Revenge y el llamado del grupo en contra de los centros de embarazo pro-vida. Hace unos d\u00edas, Rubio inst\u00f3 a Garland a que investigue amenazas contra organizaciones pro-vida. Previamente, Rubio tambi\u00e9n inst\u00f3 a Garland a enjuiciar a quienes intimidan a los jueces de la Corte Suprema de Justicia de EE.UU.\u00a0El texto de la carta en ingl\u00e9s est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nPriorities\nServices\nContact\nAbout\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
