The tribunal ruled that terminations should be illegal even in cases where a foetus is diagnosed with a serious and irreversible birth defect. This kind of abortion accounts for almost all of the small number of abortions performed legally in the country.Poland's abortion ban is a cynical attempt to exploit religion by a failing leader | Karolina WiguraRead moreThe decision has still not been published, despite a Monday deadline, and as such has not entered into force. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a political decision,\u201d said Anna W\u00f3jcik, a researcher at the law studies institute at the Polish Academy of Sciences. \u201cJudgments are meant to be published with no delay. It\u2019s a legal trick to withhold publishing.\u201dThe tribunal\u2019s decision, which was in response to a challenge from a group of rightwing MPs, has focused anger on the Law and Justice (PiS) party. PiS has ruled Poland since 2015 and has been accused of eroding democratic norms during its time in power, including by packing the constitutional tribunal with its supporters.The abortion ruling has caused anger beyond the usual groups of PiS opponents, and the scale of the protests appears to have taken the government by surprise. The more extreme wing of the party supports the constitutional ruling, but surveys show that much of the party\u2019s voter base does not support tighter abortion restrictions, so the PiS hierarchy finds itself in a difficult spot.The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has called for talks with protesters and opposition MPs, while the PiS-aligned president, Andrzej Duda, suggested a new proposal that would allow abortion in cases of life-threatening birth defects but not for conditions such as Down\u2019s syndrome.Duda\u2019s proposal is likely to be criticised from both sides \u2013 as too weak by the extreme right of the ruling coalition, and as not going far enough by those leading the street protests.The protesters have ignored a ban on gatherings of more than five people, intended to slow the spread of coronavirus, and have come out in force. More than 100,000 people gathered in the streets of Warsaw on Friday evening for the largest gathering so far. They shouted pro-choice and anti-PiS slogans.There has also been violence in which far-right groups have attacked protesters, and government figures appeared to stoke the tensions. The PiS leader and deputy prime minister, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, told people they should \u201cdefend churches\u201d from the protesters after some were defaced. Senior figures in the country\u2019s powerful Catholic church have spoken out in favour of the constitutional ruling.Explore more on these topicsPolandAbortionWomenEuropeProtestnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Third night of protests in Poland after abortion ban takes effect29 Jan 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Poland to implement near-total ban on abortion imminently27 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
