(AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court on Wednesday once again reinstated a Tennessee ban on abortions because of a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, or because of the race or gender of the fetus.The ban is part of a sweeping anti-abortion measure that has faced multiple legal challenges since it was enacted in 2020 by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Notably, the law banned abortion as early as six weeks \u2014 a time frame when most women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 but that portion has remained blocked from going into effect.In Wednesday\u2019s decision, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the request by the Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office to reverse course and temporarily allow the so-called reason ban to be enforced. The 6th Circuit had\u00a0blocked that provision\u00a0in September after previously allowing it to go into effect in 2020.The back-and-forth over the reason ban comes after the same federal appeals court\u00a0signaled in December\u00a0that it might be willing to allow Tennessee\u2019s fetal heartbeat measure to be implemented. The court vacated a previous decision made by the appeals court\u2019s three-judge panel and scheduled a rehearing before the full court.Abortion ban: Tennessee's strict new abortion law to go before full 6th Circuit Court of AppealsIn a four-page dissent, Circuit Judge Karen Nelson Moore wrote that the appeals court was refusing to schedule the hearing until the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision on whether to uphold Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The decision could\u00a0dramatically limit abortion rights\u00a0in the United States. According to Moore, the appeals court is waiting to see if the high court\u2019s decision will affect Tennessee\u2019s case.\u201c(These) stay-and-delay tactics subvert the normal judicial process, harming both the substance of our ultimate decision and our court\u2019s legitimacy,\u201d she added.Attorneys representing the plaintiffs, which include reproductive rights advocates and health clinics that provide abortions, criticized Wednesday\u2019s ruling.\u201cPregnant people are the ones best suited to make decisions about their own pregnancies, and politicians should not get to interrogate a person\u2019s reasons for seeking an abortion,\u201d Rabia Muqaddam, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThese bans are blatantly unconstitutional.\u201dA spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment.The plaintiffs also have argued the ban was improperly vague, claiming the law failed to provide clear guidelines for abortion providers to avoid criminal prosecution.Currently, more than a dozen states have similar reason bans in place. However, even Tennessee\u2019s state attorneys have acknowledged that it would be incredibly difficult for a prosecutor to prove that a physician knew in advance that a woman was seeking an abortion because of a Down syndrome diagnosis. The law calls for criminal penalties against doctors who violate it.Down syndrome is a genetic abnormality that causes developmental delays and medical conditions such as heart defects and respiratory and hearing problems.According to the National Down Syndrome Society, about one in every 700 babies in the United States \u2014 or about 6,000 a year \u2014 is born with the condition, which results from a chromosomal irregularity. There are no official figures on how many prenatal diagnoses of Down syndrome prompt a decision to abort; a 2012 study by medical experts estimated the abortion rate was 67%.\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
