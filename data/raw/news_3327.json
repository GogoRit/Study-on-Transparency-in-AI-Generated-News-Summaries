Wade, the abortion question returns to the legislatures of the fifty states. Laws governing abortion  will vary by state. While some states have  already passed laws\u00a0increasing protections for mothers and their unborn children, other states are sadly  attempting to head in the opposite direction.\nBecause of this, we can map out what abortion laws will look like around the country. But first, let\u2019s break down what kinds of laws we\u2019re talking about. Generally speaking, they fall into four categories:\n1. Pre-Roe laws: These are laws that existed prior to 1973 but remain unenforced or enjoined due to Roe. Now that Roe has been reversed, these laws, most of which are strongly pro-life, could be enforced once again.\n2. Trigger laws: These are laws that can go into effect (be \u201ctriggered\u201d) now that Roe has been overturned. Numerous states have pro-life trigger laws.\n3. Enjoined laws: Many states enacted pro-life laws after Roe\u00a0that have been ruled unconstitutional by a court (including, for example, heartbeat laws, gestational limits, and discriminatory-abortion protections) that may be brought back into effect with Roe\u2019s reversal.\n4. Pro-abortion laws and court decisions: Several states have pro-abortion laws that codify a \u201cright to abortion\u201d in state law. In other states, courts have ruled that a \u201cright to abortion\u201d is protected by the state\u2019s constitution. These laws and court decisions remain in effect after Roe was reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAlabama\n\nstate constitution affirmatively declares that it does not protect or recognize a \u201cright to
