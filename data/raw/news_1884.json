(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough nearly every person who spoke acknowledged it was inadequate, Idaho\u2019s House Republicans voted nearly unanimously to pass a bill meant to help ease physicians\u2019 fears about being prosecuted under Idaho\u2019s abortion laws while providing care.\nJust one of the House\u2019s 11 Democrats voted no on the bill as the others walked out of the chamber prior to the vote.\nThe House\u2019s State Affairs Committee printed House Bill 374 on Tuesday and held a hearing Wednesday afternoon. In a quick turnaround, since the Legislature aims to recess at the end of this week, the House suspended rules to take up the bill on the floor after the committee adjourned. It now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nThe bill is a version of House Bill 342, which the committee tabled March 20 after criticism from Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon. That bill included many changes to Idaho\u2019s existing abortion ban, and it was crafted in consultation with the Idaho Medical Association.\nHouse Affairs Chairman Brent Crane, R-Nampa, said it wasn\u2019t the bill he wanted to come out of the session either, but something had to be done.\n\u201cThis is the bill we\u2019re going to have to advance. We\u2019re going to make this first step,\u201d Crane said during the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end. It is the start of where the state of Idaho is going to wrestle with this question.\u201d\n New version eliminates language about considering potential health complications\n\nThe new version includes nearly all of the same content but eliminated a key provision that Democrats protested \u2014 one that allowed physicians to consider potential health complications that would occur without an abortion.\nThe sentence in question would have added the treatment of a physical condition that, if left untreated, would be life threatening to the pregnant person.\nDemocratic legislators in committee and on the House floor said the new bill will do nothing to prevent physicians from leaving the state and clinics from shuttering obstetrics services because the laws make it even more difficult to recruit and retain physicians. Derek Farr, communications director for the Idaho House and Senate Democrats, said the group walked out because they were angry and frustrated.\n\u201cIf this is supposedly the fix, then the women of Idaho are in real trouble,\u201d said Rep. Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, during the debate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of a charade that fixes nothing.\u201d\nThe bill includes language stating that birth control methods, including the pill and IUDs, are not considered violations of the state\u2019s abortion law. It also states that the removal of a dead fetus or the removal of ectopic or molar pregnancies, which occur when a fertilized egg implants in an area outside of the uterus, are not considered abortions.\nIt also changes a physician\u2019s actions to prevent a pregnant person\u2019s death from an affirmative defense, which would be used in court after charges are filed against a medical professional, to an exception.\nDr. Lauren Miller, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Boise, said the language in the original bill would have allowed physicians to determine whether a condition could lead to death within a certain amount of time rather than compelling doctors to use the safest interpretation.\n\u201cWe have to interpret that very conservatively, because it\u2019s a felony,\u201d Miller said. \u201cImminent death is the only exception that we see out of this current version that was passed.\u201d\nMiller said situations like kidney or heart disease can be exacerbated by pregnancy, and lead to early death within a few years, or cause someone to need a heart transplant sooner than they otherwise would have because of the strain of a pregnancy. Even a patient with severe preeclampsia during the second trimester of pregnancy could be a gray area, Miller said.\n\u201cRight now, with a felony charge against you and no further clarity, we can\u2019t act until we truly believe you\u2019re dying,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll have to transport you out of state.\u201d\nTransporting a patient to a hospital out of state is expensive for the patient and the health care system, Miller said, and the patient can deteriorate further during the trip.\n Legislator: If we can\u2019t get this done this year, it won\u2019t happen in 2024\n\nLegislators acknowledged more work will need to be done in the 2024 legislative session, but Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, said she didn\u2019t think that was realistic given that 2024 is a presidential election year.\n\u201cThis is the year to fix it,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fix it in a non-election year, I guarantee you we\u2019re not going to be able to fix it next year.\u201d\nMiller said she appreciates that legislators acknowledged more needs to be done and this isn\u2019t the end of the discussion, but she said physicians such as herself have been reaching out to legislators since July 2022 with little response.\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that none of those legislators have taken the opportunity to talk directly to us as physicians,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re trying to make it look like something happened, when in fact, this makes no meaningful change for my day-to-day life as a physician.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIdaho legislators pass contentious bill that adds clarification language to abortion ban\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun March 29, 2023\nIdaho legislators pass contentious bill that adds clarification language to abortion ban\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun March 29, 2023\n Although nearly every person who spoke acknowledged it was inadequate, Idaho\u2019s House Republicans voted nearly unanimously to pass a bill meant to help ease physicians\u2019 fears about being prosecuted under Idaho\u2019s abortion laws while providing care.\nJust one of the House\u2019s 11 Democrats voted no on the bill as the others walked out of the chamber prior to the vote.\nThe House\u2019s State Affairs Committee printed House Bill 374 on Tuesday and held a hearing Wednesday afternoon.
