The incorporation documents, obtained from the Texas secretary of state, provide further evidence that the plaintiffs cherry-picked a court they believed would be amenable to their arguments, an act of forum shopping that was orchestrated to land the case before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump-appointed darling of the far right.\nThe Alliance incorporated in Amarillo in August 2022, bringing together five out-of-state anti-abortion groups: the Catholic Medical Association, the Coptic Medical Association of North America, the American College of Pediatricians, the Christian Medical\u00a0& Dental Associations, and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The groups also argue that sending abortion medications through the mail violates federal criminal law. To advance their argument, the plaintiffs have assembled a raft of dubious evidence to allege that the FDA is anti-science and mifepristone is a wildly dangerous drug, despite decades of scientific research and hundreds of medical studies that demonstrate otherwise. They have dished it all up for a federal judge who, in just a short time on the bench, has developed a reputation for factitious legal opinions. A ruling in their favor could see medication abortion all but banned across the U.S., sparking a new round of chaos after the fall of Roe v. Wade and laying the groundwork for the dispute to land before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\nMifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs used in a medication abortion, are seen at the Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic in Santa Teresa, N.M., on June 17, 2022.\nPhoto: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\nSuspect Assertions\nMedication abortion is a two-drug protocol designed for use in early pregnancy termination. The first drug, mifepristone, blocks progesterone (a hormone needed to maintain pregnancy) and softens the uterine lining; the second drug, misoprostol, is taken 24 to 48 hours later and causes the uterus to contract, expelling the pregnancy.\nThe regimen was developed in France in the late 1980s, but it wasn\u2019t until 2000 that the FDA finally approved it for use in the United States. Medication abortion accounted for just 5 percent of abortions in 2001 but has steadily grown in popularity; today, medication abortion accounts for more than half of all pregnancy terminations in the country. The protocol is also commonly used for miscarriage management.\nThe FDA has enforced a slew of restrictions tied to mifepristone that advocates and providers have long argued are medically unnecessary \u2014 including a rule that it must be dispensed in person, even though misoprostol is not taken until later at a place of the patient\u2019s choosing. During the pandemic, the in-person dispensing rule was blocked, and in December 2021, the FDA announced that it was permanently lifting the requirement. The agency has since taken additional steps to expand access to medication abortion by allowing mail-order and brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense it to patients with prescriptions in states where abortion is legal.\n\n\n\n \n\n        Related      \n\u201cWe\u2019re Going to Where the Fight Is\u201d: Abortion Rights Movement Sets Its Sights on Key States\n\n\n\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, its partner organizations, and several individual doctors \u2014 represented by lawyers with the Christian-right Alliance Defending Freedom \u2014 filed suit in Texas, arguing that the FDA never should have approved mifepristone in the first place, let alone expand its use or loosen dispensing requirements.\nThe filing is a jumbled mess of suspect assertions, cloaked in inflammatory and medically inaccurate language. The filing refers to medication abortion as \u201cchemical\u201d abortion and claims that mifepristone \u201cstarves the baby to death.\u201d It alleges that medication abortion is far riskier than procedural abortion or carrying a pregnancy to term, which the plaintiffs argue \u201crarely\u201d leads to threatening complications. They call mifepristone an \u201cendocrine disrupter\u201d that could threaten the normal development of adolescents who take it. And they assert that individuals suffering complications from medication abortion could \u201coverwhelm\u201d the health care system, leading to a flood of blood transfusions that \u201cexacerbates the current critical national blood shortage.\u201d\nThese allegations are baseless. An endocrine disrupter is a chemical that mimics or interferes with the body\u2019s hormones, such as PFAS, a class of toxic \u201cforever\u201d chemicals found in dozens of common products that has been linked to cancer and other illnesses. The notion that mifepristone \u2014 taken in a single dose \u2014 falls into this camp because it \u201cbriefly blocks progesterone receptors in the uterus is completely unfounded,\u201d according to an amicus brief filed in the case by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and eight other leading U.S. medical groups. \u201cThere is no reason to think, nor is there evidence to show, that preventing the absorption of progesterone for a brief window would have any effects on adolescent development,\u201d the brief states.\n\u201cMifepristone\u2019s safety profile is on par with common painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which more than 30 million Americans take in any given day.\u201d\nThe assertion that medication abortion is a risky and understudied endeavor recklessly approved by the FDA is equally spurious. To date, mifepristone has been used in more than 630 published clinical trials, including more than 420 randomized, controlled studies, which the amicus brief notes\u00a0are the \u201cgold standard of research design.\u201d At less than 1 percent, the risk of serious complications is exceedingly low. The likelihood of any complication at all is about 5 percent; the most common is an incomplete expulsion, which may require a procedural abortion to complete. Meanwhile, the risk of death associated with carrying a pregnancy to term is 14 times higher than the risk associated with abortion.\n\u201cMifepristone\u2019s safety profile is on par with common painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which more than 30 million Americans take in any given day,\u201d according to the amicus brief. Procedures like wisdom teeth removal, colonoscopy, and plastic surgery have higher complication and death rates, as does the use of Viagra. \u201cPut simply,\u201d the brief states, \u201cmedication abortion is among the safest medical interventions in any category \u2014 related to pregnancy or not.\u201d\nBehind the Scenes\nThe fight over abortion has long featured a shadow medical community that exists to promote counterfactual narratives about risks associated with the procedure. To Mary Ziegler, a law professor and legal historian at the University of California, Davis, the fact that the Alliance\u00a0for Hippocratic Medicine was established to go after medication abortion isn\u2019t surprising.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tradition of groups like this forming,\u201d Ziegler said. Back in the 1990s, for example, a group called the Physicians Ad Hoc Committee for Truth sprang up for the purposes of advocating for a ban on dilation and extraction abortion, which anti-abortion forces dubbed \u201cpartial-birth abortion.\u201d Once Congress passed the ban, the committee disappeared.\nWhile the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine itself is a new entity, presumably incorporated to bolster the pending lawsuit, the groups organized under it have been around for a long time. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, known as AAPLOG, formed in the wake of the 1973 Roe decision, initially as an affinity group of anti-abortion physicians who belonged to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, the country\u2019s leading professional membership organization for OB-GYNs.\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver time, AAPLOG began to push back against the medical and scientific establishment, developing a narrative that abortion was not only immoral, but also dangerous. The group focused more on disputing the \u201cfactual premises of things ACOG was saying, rather than just disputing the morality or ethics of those decisions,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cMedical arguments against abortion bans were effective enough that they needed to be met with medical arguments for abortion bans,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s an appetite for these organizations to have their own narratives.\u201d\nAAPLOG has since split from ACOG and now has roughly 7,000 members compared to ACOG\u2019s more than 60,000 (anyone can join the former, while the latter\u2019s membership is limited to medical professionals). Despite its size, AAPLOG has successfully pressed its counternarrative in legislative and legal crusades to restrict or ban abortion, even when the scientific underpinning for its position is shaky.\nTake the work of George Delgado, one of the named plaintiffs in the Alliance\u00a0for Hippocratic Medicine lawsuit. A doctor in Southern California, Delgado developed so-called abortion pill reversal: the notion that a person who changes their mind about going through with a medication abortion after taking mifepristone (but before taking misoprostol) can interrupt the process by taking a large dose of prescription progesterone to reestablish the pregnancy. There is no evidence that the protocol is safe or effective; the only controlled study designed to interrogate it was halted based on \u201csafety concerns\u201d after three of 12 participants hemorrhaged and were taken to the hospital. Still, AAPLOG has deemed medication abortion reversal a \u201cmedically sound choice\u201d and supported state efforts to mandate counseling on reversal for anyone seeking abortion.\n\u201cWhen you have arguments about science that are not based that much in evidence, not only is it confusing and obviously can lead to really bad outcomes, but it\u2019s also disenfranchising.\u201d\nWhile the alternate narratives pushed by groups like AAPLOG may be politically powerful, they are also dangerous, offering the imprimatur of science without sound foundational support. \u201cWhen you have arguments about science that are not based that much in evidence, not only is it confusing and obviously can lead to really bad outcomes, but it\u2019s also disenfranchising,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cBecause normal people don\u2019t know anything about these topics, right? They don\u2019t know about the relative rate of complications of mifepristone. And so if what\u2019s really going on here is a struggle over constitutional values and ethics and so on, we should be telling the truth about that.\u201d\nThe shadow medical community\u2019s efforts to legitimize various abortion restrictions have been effective \u2014 like a requirement that abortion doctors maintain hospital admitting privileges, which groups including AAPLOG claimed was a best practice designed to ensure patient safety. Broadly speaking, such efforts worked in front of state lawmakers but typically failed at the Supreme Court.\nNow, with Roe in the rearview mirror and no immediately obvious need to keep pressing such pseudoscience, Ziegler suspects that groups like AAPLOG are still leaning into these arguments because their real aims \u2014 like establishing fetal personhood rights \u2014 \u201care still not popular,\u201d she said. Anti-abortion ballot measures have repeatedly failed with voters, and a significant majority of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re having to take their claims to courts and to judges like Judge Kacsmaryk \u2026 and they\u2019re having to rely on weird interpretations of FDA regulations.\u201d This is \u201cnot a window into what they think is the most important,\u201d she said, but \u201cwhat they think will work.\u201d\n\n\nThe J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse where U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk will rule in a lawsuit challenging medication abortion, on Feb. 11, 2023, in Amarillo, Texas.\nPhoto: Justin Rex/AP Photo\nA Slippery Slope\nBefore being tapped to serve as the federal district court judge in Amarillo, Kacsmaryk worked at the religious-right First Liberty Institute, which, among other things, opposes the separation of church and state. Kacsmaryk has been vocal about his disdain for gay marriage, reproductive rights, and transgender people. In 2016, he signed onto a letter that called being transgender an \u201cirrational \u2026 delusion\u201d (the Catholic Medical Association, which is a party in the mifepristone lawsuit, was also a signatory). And he\u2019s written that the sexual revolution was destructive, seeking \u201cpublic affirmation of the lie that the human person is an autonomous blob of Silly Putty unconstrained by nature or biology, and that marriage, sexuality, gender identity, and even the unborn child must yield to the erotic desires of liberated adults.\u201d\n\n\nTrump-appointed Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk at his Senate confirmation hearing in 2017.\nScreenshot: The Intercept/Youtube/Senate Judiciary CommitteeWhile on the bench, Kacsmaryk has made a string of controversial rulings: He declared Biden administration protections for transgender workers unlawful; twice ordered the administration to enforce the Trump-era \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy; and attacked Title X, the only federal program designed to provide birth control to low-income and uninsured people.\nIn the Title X case, Deanda v. Becerra, Kacsmaryk sided with Texas father Alexander Deanda, who was challenging the program based on its guarantee of patient confidentiality. Deanda claimed that the program violated his rights as a parent raising his daughters according to \u201cChristian teaching on matters of sexuality.\u201d With Title X in place, he argued, he had no assurance that his daughters would be \u201cunable to access \u2026 contraception\u201d and other services that \u201cfacilitate sexual promiscuity.\u201d\nAmong the criticisms leveled at Kacsmaryk in the wake of his ruling in favor of Deanda was that he lacked power to consider the case in the first place. To bring a federal lawsuit, a plaintiff must show they\u2019ve been injured by the law they\u2019re challenging, but Deanda \u2014 who never alleged that his children attempted to avail themselves of Title X services \u2014 hadn\u2019t been harmed. Deanda had no standing to bring the suit, in other words, and Kacsmaryk had no cause to hear it. Nonetheless, Kacsmaryk ruled that the Title X program as administered violated the \u201cconstitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.\u201d\nIn response to the pending mifepristone lawsuit, the federal government has argued that the FDA\u2019s approval of the drug in 2000 was based on years of solid research, that the statute of limitations to challenge that approval has since run out, and that, like Deanda, the plaintiffs have no standing.\nThe FDA argues that neither the medical associations nor the individual doctors bringing the suit have suffered any injury related to the drug\u2019s approval. And indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of injury are tenuous. While the doctors who are party to the lawsuit don\u2019t provide medication abortion, they argue that they may one day find themselves in a situation where a person allegedly harmed by mifepristone comes to them for treatment, thus drawing their attention away from existing patients. And they say that these impaired patients may present with an incomplete abortion, which would conscript the doctors into providing services that violate their conscience. Meanwhile, the organizations argue that the approval of mifepristone has forced them to divert time and energy away from other priorities, like advocating for fetal personhood, forcing them to focus instead on \u201ceducating\u201d their members about the dangers of medication abortion.\nTo the FDA, this theory of legal injury is nonsense \u2014 and a slippery slope: Allowing the case to go forward would greenlight other baseless legal complaints, it argues in response to the Alliance lawsuit. \u201cIf FDA approved a new heart medicine, emergency physicians would have standing to challenge the approval on the theory that some patients would experience adverse events under the new treatment; in contrast, cardiologists would have standing to challenge the approval on the theory that some patients would no longer require their services.\u201d\nA Zombie Law\nIn a response filed in early February, the Alliance Defending Freedom lawyers brushed off the government\u2019s arguments about standing \u2014 the doctors and organizations bringing the suit had \u201cstanding six ways from Sunday,\u201d they asserted. They doubled down on their fearmongering, arguing that medication abortion had never been studied under \u201creal-world conditions,\u201d and that the doctors bringing the suit actually \u201ctreat and care for countless victims of this dangerous drug regimen.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs also leaned into allegations that allowing medication abortion to be mailed to patients violates the 19th-century law known as the Comstock Act, which outlawed sending anything considered \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile\u201d through the mail, including contraceptives and \u201cevery article or thing\u201d that could be used for abortion. Over the years, judicial and congressional actions have largely neutered the act, and in late December, the Department of Justice penned an opinion noting that the law does not apply where abortion is legal or when the sender doesn\u2019t intend that the recipient would use the drugs illegally. But the Comstock Act is still on the books, a zombie law that the Alliance plaintiffs are trying to raise from the dead.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n            Read Our Complete Coverage          \nThe End of Roe\n\n\n\n\nIf Kacsmaryk agrees that the Comstock Act applies to medication abortion, the impact could be far-reaching. The act forbids the mailing of any device that may be used for abortion, which would include countless medications and routine gynecological instruments. It could also impact the availability of misoprostol, which absent mifepristone, can be used alone to accomplish an abortion. It is not as effective as the two-drug regimen but has for decades been used safely for that purpose; the Alliance lawsuit does not attack FDA approval of misoprostol.\nA hearing in the case has yet to be scheduled. Meanwhile, a coalition of 12 states, led by Washington and Oregon, filed their own lawsuit last week asking another federal judge to rule that mifepristone is safe and effective and that its FDA approval is \u201clawful and valid.\u201d The states are asking the judge to eliminate all remaining FDA-imposed restrictions on mifepristone, which they argue impermissibly impede access to the drug.\nOn February 24, Vice President Kamala Harris met with reproductive rights advocates and medical experts, including from ACOG and the American Academy of Family Physicians. The Alliance lawsuit is not just an attack on \u201cwomen\u2019s fundamental freedoms,\u201d she warned. \u201cIt is an attack on the very foundation of our public health system.\u201d\n\u201cThose who would attack \u2026 the ability of the FDA to make a decision\u201d about approving a drug like mifepristone \u201cought to look in their own medicine cabinets to figure out whether they\u2019re prepared to say those medications \u2026 should no longer be available to them,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that is what we are talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jordan Smith          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      jordan.smith@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @chronic_jordan                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Where the Fight Is\u201d: Abortion Rights Movement Sets Its Sights on Key States      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The Right\u2019s Creeping Pro-Natalist Rhetoric on Abortion and Trans Health Care      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The End of Roe: Saving Abortion Rights Means Taking Them Into Our Own Hands      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The Fight for Reproductive Justice in a Post-Ginsburg World      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
