Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday marks the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court case guaranteeing the right to an abortion that was\u00a0overturned\u00a0last year.\nSince the landmark ruling fell last summer, Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban has been on and off and now back on as a legal challenge moves its way through the courts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really devastating. There has been a lot of rage, a lot of sadness, a lot of grief specifically,\u201d Kristen Baker with the Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center, an Atlanta clinic that has offered abortion services since the 1970s, said during a virtual discussion Saturday organized by the Amplify Georgia Collaborative.\n  Anti-abortion protesters march past the Georgia Capitol on Friday. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.\nWhile abortion rights advocates mourn the loss of federal protections and chart a way forward in a post-Roe world, some abortion opponents marked the anniversary by pressing for more restrictions at a gathering near the state Capitol.\nGeorgia now forbids most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, earlier than many women even think to buy a pregnancy test. When the measure passed in 2019, Georgia Republicans boasted it was the strictest law in the country. Other states have since passed stricter laws than Georgia\u2019s.\nFor people like Daphne Harris Nicely, executive director of the Atlanta Morning Center, an anti-abortion pregnancy center, that means embryonic people are being murdered every day.\n\u201cThose who fought solely for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, you got what you asked for,\u201d she told a crowd of several hundred Friday at the Georgia March for Life Memorial Service Rally. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done. We need the personhood, the humanity, the dignity of the life of that child to be recognized, the intrinsic value of that life.\u201d\nWoodstock Republican Rep. Charlice Byrd said that\u2019s what she hopes to accomplish with a new bill in the 2023 legislative session.\n\u201cI will propose an amendment to the Constitution of the state of Georgia that this state shall recognize the paramount right to life of all human beings as persons at any stage of development,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cA resolution will go out for you to vote on that, that all life matters.\u201d\n  Rep. Charlice Byrd. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\nIn addition to the six-week cutoff, Georgia doctors can provide abortions if the woman\u2019s health is at risk, if the pregnancy is not viable or in cases of rape or incest in which a police report has been filed. Byrd said her bill would eliminate those three exceptions.\n\u201cWe have those exceptions right now, the three, but I want to eliminate those three. It is total pro-life,\u201d she said.\nPassing such a bill would not be an easy task. A constitutional amendment requires two-thirds majorities from both chambers. The state\u2019s 2019 abortion law passed the House with one vote to spare on a simple majority, and Democrats have gained ground in the chamber since then, though Republicans still control the Legislature.\nA change in the state constitution would also need to be approved by a majority of voters, and a\u00a0poll\u00a0released in October found nearly two-thirds of Georgians opposed to the current abortion law.\n\u2018Wait and see\u2019\nHouse Speaker Jon Burns indicated Thursday he\u2019s not\u00a0gung ho about changing Georgia\u2019s law right now, preferring instead to see what the state Supreme Court rules on a Fulton County judge\u2019s decision to overturn the law.\n\u201cI think the posture that the House should be in \u2013 and certainly the posture Jon Burns is in \u2013 is we\u2019re going to wait and see exactly what becomes of the legislation we passed,\u201d Burns said.\n  House Speaker Jon Burns talks to reporters as the legislative session gets underway. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to hear from the state Supreme Court, and then we\u2019ll move forward on something if we need to. If not, we certainly have something in place.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s high court is\u00a0set\u00a0to hear arguments in late March, while the deadline for bills to smoothly cross from one chamber to the other this year is March 6.\nSpeaking to reporters at the rally, Byrd said she was not fazed by Burns\u2019 wait-and-see posture.\n\u201cIt is still my right to be able to carry legislation at any time that I want,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, he can easily tell me no, but there\u2019s a whole lot of people out here that want this to happen. They want a pro-life amendment. So we can have that conversation and dialogue with Speaker Burns, not today, but certainly in the coming days while we\u2019re in session.\u201d\nLeading the protesters in prayer before a silent march around downtown Atlanta, Nathaniel Darnell, who is the Georgia director for the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, grimly suggested God has ways of dealing with lawmakers who do not advance his preferred total abortion ban legislation.\n\u201cMay you protect those that would protect life. Lord, may you please confront those legislators who might seek to be an obstacle to these efforts. We thank you for how you have relieved us from one legislator, a speaker who made himself an obstacle, and we pray that, Father, you would help other legislators to serve you in fear, to take warning.\u201d\nFormer House Speaker David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican who was a revered state leader, died\u00a0in November after an extended illness. He was 68.\n\u2018Not going away\u2019 \nWhile the state\u2019s staunchest anti-abortion advocates rallied at the state Capitol for stricter limits, abortion rights advocates recognized the anniversary by rallying people to channel their frustration into action.\n\u201cWe know that there\u2019s always a lot of work to do to push back against the things that are unraveling here to make sure that they unravel less here in Georgia,\u201d Roula AbiSamra, state campaign director with Amplify Georgia, said during Saturday\u2019s virtual discussion. \u201cAnd at the same time, we\u2019ve got to continue weaving, building for much better than the status quo.\u201d\n  Abortion rights demonstrators march through Atlanta in 2022. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.\nRep. Shea Roberts, an Atlanta Democrat, said a bill will be filed this week that would protect abortion access in Georgia, though she acknowledged it\u2019s unlikely to receive a hearing in the GOP-controlled General Assembly.\n\u201cWhat we plan to do in the future is obviously to continue to get in their face every opportunity we have to let them know that Georgians who support absolute access to all health care, including abortion care, are not going away \u2013 that we expect our freedom, we deserve our freedom and that we are going to stay in front of them,\u201d Roberts said.\nRoberts said she remains hopeful the state Supreme Court will toss out Georgia\u2019s abortion law since it passed before Roe v. Wade was overturned, which a Fulton County judge ruled makes the law \u201cplainly unconstitutional.\u201d\nThat would throw the issue back to lawmakers to decide whether to try again when the 2019 measure barely cleared the House, which now has a slightly smaller GOP majority and dozens of new lawmakers.\nState Rep. Karen Lupton, a freshly sworn-in Democrat from Chamblee, said reproductive freedom was a major concern for voters in her district, including men, during her campaign.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting an uphill battle, but we are ready to do it \u2013 mitigate the bad stuff and stand in the way of even worse,\u201d Lupton said.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXGeorgia\u2019s six-week ban not enough for anti-abortion activists pressing for more restrictions at Roe\u2019s 50th anniversary\nby Ross Williams, Georgia Recorder January 21, 2023\nGeorgia\u2019s six-week ban not enough for anti-abortion activists pressing for more restrictions at Roe\u2019s 50th anniversary\nby Ross Williams, Georgia Recorder January 21, 2023\n Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of the Roe v.
