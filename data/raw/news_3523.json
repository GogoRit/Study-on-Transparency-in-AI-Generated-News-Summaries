Wade being overturned, 2,512 unborn babies have been protected by our law,\u201d he told reporters.That\u2019s likely an overcount. Since the U.S. Supreme Court ended abortion rights on June 24, triggering Louisiana\u2019s law banning nearly all abortions, the number of Louisiana women ordering abortion pills online illegally has tripled. Others have traveled to states where abortion remains legal. Still, hundreds of women have likely been forced to stay pregnant here in recent months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana Right to Life \u2014 the state\u2019s most powerful anti-abortion group \u2014 has been celebrating a victory it\u2019s spent over 50 years fighting to achieve, but it wants to go further. It wants to end an exception to the ban that allows for abortions for so-called \u201cmedically futile\u201d pregnancies in the next legislative session.\u201cWe would support efforts to remove that exception,\u201d Clapper said.The exception for medically futile pregnancies was added to the law this spring \u2014 against Louisiana Right to Life\u2019s lobbying \u2014 to allow for abortion when a fetus has a condition so severe it won\u2019t survive birth.In the months since the ban took effect, Louisiana Right to Life has been arguing on social media and in church meetings that the exception is morally wrong because, it says, abortions in these cases kill a fetus before it can reach its natural death.At the press conference, Clapper said nobody should be allowed abortions for terminally ill fetuses.\u201cEvery human person, even if they are disabled, born or unborn deserves their full lifespan, whether their lifespan is short or long,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cWe should never kill another person because they are sick or disabled.\u201dBanning abortions for terminally-ill fetusesThe medically futile provision of the law instructs the Louisiana Department of Health to create a list of conditions it deems incompatible with life and that allows for legal abortions. Louisiana Right to Life suggested the list stop at just four conditions. The health department\u2019s list currently has 25.The conditions are so severe that they typically result in fetuses that die within hours or days of being born. These pregnancies also carry risks beyond the fetus\u2019 survival.The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the professional organization that represents physicians who treat high-risk pregnancies, said physicians are \u201cethically bound\u201d to give their patients the option of abortion when a fetal diagnosis indicates there\u2019s no chance of long-term survival because of the risks to the patient\u2019s health of continuing the pregnancy.Louisiana\u2019s law made national headlines this summer when Nancy Davis was denied an abortion at Woman\u2019s Hospital in Baton Rouge after learning her fetus had no brain or skull. The specific diagnosis \u2014 acrania \u2014 wasn\u2019t explicitly on the health department list, though Woman\u2019s Hospital officials and some doctors have said the diagnosis is included under anencephaly, which is on the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoman\u2019s Hospital officials said Davis was denied an abortion because of other anti-abortion laws on the books in Louisiana. As a result, Davis ended up traveling to New York for an abortion, an experience she called \u201cdevastating.\u201d In the wake of Davis\u2019 story, the health department is considering adding acrania to that list, to make it explicit that patients who carry a fetus with acrania can get an abortion.Louisiana Right to Life \u201cabhors\u201d the creation of the health department\u2019s \u201clist of babies that can be killed,\u201d according to a post on its Instagram account.And as a kind of counterpoint to Davis\u2019 story, the group has been promoting stories of families who chose to carry these kinds of pregnancies to term. Louisiana Right to Life has been sharing images of a 1.5-year-old baby named Mary Teresa who was born with Trisomy 18, another condition that allows for abortion and one that kills most children before their first birthday.In another story at the press conference, Clapper talked about a friend whose baby, Tess, was diagnosed with trisomy 13, a terminal illness that currently allows for a legal abortion.\u201cBut my friend did not choose abortion,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cTess was born, and she only lived for nine hours. While her life was short, my friend shares that Tess was a blessing to her family.\u201dDefending their gainsBeyond further restricting abortion access, Louisiana Right to Life has been focused on defending the state\u2019s ban \u2014 one of the most restrictive in the nation.That was the focus of an anti-abortion rally in October, when a few dozen anti-abortion activists gathered for a rally at Veterans Memorial Boulevard in Metairie.Karen Villarreal, a 64-year-old from New Orleans, held up her sign as cars sped past that read \u201cWomen deserve better than abortion.\u201d\u201cThe pro-choice people have been making so much noise. I want everyone to know that pro-life people are wanting to help,\u201d she said.Beyond the criticisms from those who support abortion rights, Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban has been criticized for sowing fear and confusion inside Louisiana hospitals, where doctors now must make medical decisions about complicated pregnancy care under the threat of jail time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana health department declines to answer doctors\u2019 questions on abortion law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Seghers, the director of education for Louisiana Right to Life, said it was time to show resolve.\u201cThe climate is tense right now. And people have so many questions that people who were pro-life are sometimes even questioning it themselves,\u201d Seghers said.Seghers said there\u2019s also some concern that legislators could try to add rape and incest exceptions to the law \u2014 something Gov. John Bel Edwards has supported.\u201cI think we're at a very vulnerable position, and people are feeling angry and wanting to put exceptions in our law,\u201d Seghers said. \u201cSo legislatively, we need to be stronger than ever.\u201dThe next legislative sessionLouisiana Right to Life hasn\u2019t laid out detailed plans for the next legislative session, beyond its support for further limiting abortion. It doesn\u2019t take a position on the death penalty. Clapper said it also doesn\u2019t get involved in policy discussions over state spending for those living in poverty in Louisiana, or children in foster care.But the last legislative session might hint at areas it could pivot to, now that it\u2019s won its most coveted victory. During that session, Louisiana Right to Life supported a law that would require the labeling of vaccines created with cells from aborted fetuses. The bill failed.It also opposed a law that would have required health insurers to cover certain fertility treatments, a bill that also failed. Louisiana Right to Life, like many in the anti-abortion movement, is critical of the creation of embryos in fertility treatments.For months, Clapper and other leaders at Louisiana Right to Life have been traveling across Louisiana to shore up support for the ban, giving talks in churches and to school groups and urging anti-abortion advocates not to pack up and go home, now that most abortions are banned.Their message has been clear: For anti-abortion activists, there\u2019s more work to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nPublic Health\nLouisiana NewsAbortion Restrictions\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRosemary Westwood\n\n\n                \n                    Rosemary Westwood is the public and reproductive health reporter for WWNO/WRKF.
