Wade will likely be overturned has rattled many reproductive rights advocates. For some former pro-life activists who now support abortion rights, it has unearthed complicated feelings, including shame and regret. Slate spoke with Theresa Esmeralda Romero, a 34-year-old recruiter for Google Cloud who lives in Dallas and who used to volunteer as a counselor for anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n[Read: Why Are Crisis Pregnancy Centers Not Illegal?]\nSlate: How did you become involved in pro-life advocacy? Did you grow up religious?\nTheresa Esmeralda Romero: I grew up Pentecostal in a very close-knit, loving, working-class conservative Latino community here in Dallas. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on faith, church, God, all of that. And conservative ideas of women\u2019s roles in general. I learned early on that as a girl, my body was not my own. I grew up in a church where a woman didn\u2019t have an opinion, couldn\u2019t speak on Scripture, couldn\u2019t work\u2014and if they did, it had to be something that was more conservative. So there was a limit to what you could do. And very early on, I knew that I did not agree with that.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s very difficult in a lot of Latino communities. It\u2019s very difficult to go against your father, the church, or how the community views things. I stayed in the church throughout my youth, and then I left the church for some time. When I came back, I went to a less conservative denomination. Then, when I was a young adult, I joined the Assemblies of God. They\u2019re like Hillsong, if you\u2019re not familiar. They were more progressive. Really, what led me to go back to the church was the fact that a lot of the Black and brown community sought refuge in the church a lot of the time. So I thought if I\u2019m going to have any impact in empowering my community and questioning the validity of what we believe, I\u2019ll have to do it from within. And so I would start doing church events, outreaches. And then also got involved in the pro-life movement with crisis pregnancy centers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nI started volunteering and working with crisis pregnancy centers, or CPCs, in my early 20s. I worked at two different CPCs. One was one of the biggest here in Texas, where I worked alongside one of the biggest megachurches in the Dallas area.\nWhat were your thoughts about abortion at that time?\nI was never really against abortion. I had never been in a situation where I needed to consider that choice, but I knew close friends and family members who had, so I didn\u2019t feel it was bad or immoral or something God wouldn\u2019t approve of. To me, it was just a reality. In my own community, people had abortions all the time. Dangerous ones, and some even fatal. I knew it was happening. I knew this affected Black and brown women and poor people the most. So, no, I wasn\u2019t against it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nHere in Texas, it\u2019s portrayed very much as we are fighting for the lives of unborn children so that our community can thrive, and it\u2019s the government that wants to keep our kids from living. That God would never impregnate someone and not have a plan for them. Everything was always planned. And as someone like myself, who had survived sexual abuse inside and outside of the church since I was 8 years old, I didn\u2019t really think there was a plan. So I didn\u2019t see the logic in that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I knew that I had to be vocal [echoing] what the church viewed abortion as. When you\u2019re in certain circles you feel you have to be pro-life. You know what you have to do and say, because people aren\u2019t open to hearing otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you start working there if you didn\u2019t share the beliefs of most of the people you worked alongside?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause it gave me access. I wanted to speak to the young women who went to the CPCs. The CPCs were always run by white women, they were always filled with white women who were going to be pastors or were pastors or the wives of pastors. And when you are a nonwhite person and you go to these places, they judge you from the second they see you. You feel shame, you feel belittled. And then you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re unsure what to do next. And I know how that feels. So I wanted to be in those spaces. So I can tell those people, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. You have to do what you have to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAt one of the centers, we would give free chlamydia and gonorrhea testing. You had to pass all these checklist things. So a lot of that for me was just to get them to pass the checklist so they could have that. Or a lot of them are also just there to get a sonogram. I did what I could so I could get people what they needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWere the people you were working with aware that you weren\u2019t always counseling against abortion?\nNo. A lot of times in those CPCs, they believe that anyone who works with them is sold on this theology. You\u2019re not being watched. And I knew what to say. I knew the Bible, and I would listen to what people were saying in church, and I would regurgitate that. The CPC liked that, because it was someone that wasn\u2019t blond-haired, blue-eyed. Some would use it to their benefit, because I was Latina. They saw it as a story: I had my first child when I was 18. So they viewed it as, look, someone who comes from that type of situation, and look how she turned out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t outright tell people [abortion] was fine. I was careful, but I would tell girls or women who go in there, ultimately, it was their decision, whatever they wanted to do.\nAre there any particular cases from your time in anti-abortion activism that stand out in your memory?\nThere is one. There was a large pro-life women\u2019s group composed of many Black and Latino women, which was good for their optics. We worked with this home where you could go in while you were pregnant, and then they would adopt your baby from there. On Fridays and weekends, we would go to the Southwest Clinic in Dallas, one of the abortion providers. We let people know choosing adoption is the loving option.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a young Black couple there who had an appointment. They already had three kids, they just couldn\u2019t make it financially. So [one activist] goes and speaks to the girl, and she\u2019s [pushing] to get them in the home to place for adoption. And I said, \u201cWhy would you do that? Why would you separate this mom from those three kids and her boyfriend?\u201d She said, \u201cYou think those three kids are more worthy of life than her next child?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like being poor.\u201d And she said, \u201cTheresa, you don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re saving lives here. And if you\u2019re so shortsighted, you shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d That girl and her boyfriend left. They didn\u2019t complete their appointment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you explain how you got pulled into a movement you disagree with?\u00a0\nI wanted to be accepted in the church. I wanted to be made good. I was a high school dropout who got pregnant at 17. I had been sexually abused by multiple men for many years. I was a working-class girl who grew up in a poor community, who needed to be made for more. And the only way we knew how, then, was if the church accepted us and elevated us.\nHow long did you work at the CPCs?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\nI worked with a CPC for five years. At the very end, I was one of the youth leaders in our church. When one of the parents spoke with me about their child, I very bluntly told them that they needed to consider birth control. That parent, of course, was not happy with that response. That was brought to my pastor at that time. My pastor told me, \u201cLook, Theresa, we know you push boundaries, but you need to understand that this is not going to change anyone\u2019s opinion. Either you ride with that, or you leave leadership.\u201d I decided to leave. This was seven years ago. And soon thereafter, I left church altogether. I had done all that I could.\nHow do you feel when you look back on your time in the pro-life movement?\nI hate that I made signs. I hate that I went to pro-life marches and rallies, I hate that I stood in front of that clinic and told people that they should only have one option. But I hope that at least my time in the CPC movement and in the churches, if I can tell those stories, can contribute to a larger conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Religion\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
