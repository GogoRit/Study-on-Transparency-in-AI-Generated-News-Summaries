Not everything good, or everything granted by a government, can be a universal right,\u201d he wrote in a\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed explaining the formation of this Commission on Unalienable Rights. \u201cLoose talk of \u2018rights\u2019 unmoors us from the principles of liberal democracy.\u201d\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t take long for human rights experts to read between the lines. Pompeo, whose leadership of the State Department has become in many ways an experiment in how quickly he can orient American foreign policy toward his evangelical Christian faith, stocked the commission with academics and diplomats best known for defending religious freedom while opposing reproductive rights and LGBTQ equality.\u00a0\nPompeo, whose leadership has become in many ways an experiment in how quickly he can orient American foreign policy toward his evangelical Christian faith, stocked the commission with academics and diplomats best known for defending religious freedom.\u00a0\nOn Thursday,\u00a0the commission finally unveiled a draft of its long-anticipated report, finding\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014just what Pompeo suggested in his initial op-ed: not all rights are created equal. Describing a human rights landscape \u201cin crisis,\u201d the report focuses\u00a0mainly on the Declaration of Independence and Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u00a0and mostly ignores the binding treaties establishing a framework for international human rights law. The problem, as the commissioners\u00a0see it, is that a proliferation of new rights include many in competition with one another,\u00a0which has eroded the international consensus around human rights. The solution, then, is to boost protections of certain rights, particularly religious freedom, while diminishing others.\u00a0\n\u201cAs anticipated, the report elevates religious freedom as an unalienable right, while dismissing abortion and same-sex marriages as not rights but instead \u2018divisive social and political controversies,'\u201d Jayne Huckerby, director of the International Human Rights Clinic at Duke Law School, tells me. She notes that the report \u201crecognizes that legally there should be no hierarchy between different types of rights,\u201d but \u201cstill calls for US foreign policy to de-emphasize economic and social rights compared with civil and political ones.\u201d\nIn practice, that has already started to happen. With Pompeo leading from Foggy Bottom, the United States has renounced its role as a leader in promoting LGBTQ equality and reproductive rights abroad, most prominently in Trump\u2019s expansion of the so-called global gag rule, which restricts which nongovernmental organizations can receive US aid based on whether they perform any abortion-related activities. US diplomats have teamed up with countries with abominable records on these issues\u2014Saudi Arabia and Brazil among them\u2014to oppose international agreements aimed at preserving those rights. When Trump appeared at the United Nations General Assembly last year, he chose to host an event focused on religious freedom. And, while\u00a0his administration regularly attempts to cut back on international aid, the president\u00a0still\u00a0recently\u00a0signed an executive order giving $50 million to support international religious freedom.\u00a0\n\u201cThis administration practices consistent and continued erasure of LGBTQ people and refuses to acknowledge that access to reproductive health care is essential for survival,\u201d says Molly Bangs, director of reproductive rights advocacy group Equity Forward. \u201cLGBTQ people face threats to their health, safety, and civil rights here at home and around the globe and this report makes zero mention of protecting their rights.\u201d\nSince the commission\u2019s formation, Pompeo has been a public cheerleader of its work, taking care to note that the group is not crafting policy, but simply elaborating \u201cthe principles through which we can ground America\u2019s commitment to championing human rights in our enduring dedication to unalienable rights and our tradition of constitutional self-government,\u201d as he wrote in the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0this week. For the past several days, he\u2019s been tweeting in anticipation of the release of its draft report, pairing quotes from Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr. with the hashtag \u201cUnalienableRights.\u201d Still, his support for the panel has often been nakedly political and, of course, does not exactly honor the legacy of the very individuals\u00a0he\u2019s held up as symbols of these unalienable rights. Pompeo\u00a0traveled to Philadelphia on Thursday, ignoring concerns about\u00a0the\u00a0safety of himself, his team, and others during the coronavirus pandemic, to give a speech at the National Constitutional Center. In his remarks, he took time to criticize \u201crioters\u201d for \u201cdesecrating monuments to those who fought for unalienable rights\u201d and suggested that the New York Times\u2018\u00a01619 Project, which examines the legacy of slavery in the United States, was \u201ca disturbed reading of history\u201d and \u201ca slander on our great people.\u201d\u00a0\nPompeo took time to criticize \u201crioters\u201d for \u201cdesecrating monuments to those who fought for unalienable rights\u201d and suggested that the New York Times\u2018 1619 Project, which examines the legacy of slavery in the United States, was \u201ca slander on our great people.\u201d\nRob Berschinski, a former State Department official who is now senior vice president for policy at Human Rights First, said Pompeo\u2019s remarks \u201cloosely clothed a foray into the culture wars under the seal of the US State Department. It should rightfully be seen as a political speech unbecoming of a Secretary of State.\u201d\u00a0\nThe speech, though, is just the culmination of a year\u2019s worth of work that, while abstract in its consideration of the historical and philosophical roots of human rights, is intensely political. Across its five public meetings, which Huckerby and her colleagues at Duke Law analyzed in an article for Just Security, \u201creligious freedom was clearly intended to be a core focus of the commission\u201d and was \u201cfrequently discussed\u201d by the commissioners, including in the context of when it clashes with the right to have an abortion.\nThere\u2019s also the simple matter of who Pompeo chose to serve as\u00a0commissioners, including chair Mary Ann Glendon, a former US ambassador to the Vatican who once said awarding the Pulitzer Prize to the Boston Globe for its coverage of sexual abuse by Catholic priests \u201cwould be like giving the Nobel Peace Prize to Osama bin Laden.\u201d (Pompeo, in his remarks on Thursday, noted that he once worked as Glendon\u2019s research assistant, calling the experience \u201cone of my life\u2019s greatest gifts.\u201d) The commissioners\u2019 selection is also one reason several human rights advocacy organizations, including Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, sued Pompeo in March, alleging that the Commission on Unalienable Rights violates federal law requiring advisory bodies be independent and \u201cfairly balanced among competing points of view.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThere is reason to believe the Secretary carefully selected the Commission members to yield a pre-determined result: constraining the understanding of \u2018unalienable\u2019 human rights to the narrow set of rights allegedly grounded in theories of natural law,\u201d the lawsuit states.\u00a0\nThis, though, was of course the point. Just look at the reaction among Pompeo\u2019s core group of supporters, the evangelical right, to see what was expected of this panel when it was announced last year. Back then, Tony Perkins, president of the right-wing Family Research Council, praised the newly-formed panel for \u201censuring that the protection of these fundamental rights\u2014the most foundational of which is freedom of religion or belief\u2014is a core element of strategic policy discussions.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for news you can trust?\n\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n\nAN IMPORTANT UPDATEWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming up short on donations month after month.
