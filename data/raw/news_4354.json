Not surprisingly, it is the only snippet from \u201cFrancesco\u201d, a wide-ranging documentary on his life, that has garnered extensive media attention and strong reactions, from unqualified praise to vocal rejection. But for people around the globe experiencing radical exclusion cloaked in terms of culture, religion and traditional morality, the pope\u2019s remarks resonate deeply.\nIn Argentina, as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Francis supported same-sex unions in a private meeting at a time when the extension of marriage seemed inevitable. Some say he saw civil unions as the lesser of two evils, a secular compromise to protect the Catholic Church\u2019s view of marriage \u2013 a task he then described as \u201cGod\u2019s war\u201d. Whatever the reason, his willingness to endorse same-sex civil unions marked a significant break with Catholic orthodoxy. Since Argentina embraced same-sex marriage a decade ago, the recognition of marriage equality has gained momentum, with 29 countries now on board. Significantly, several Catholic-majority countries, including Colombia, Ireland and Malta, have taken this step.\nBut for Francis to restate support for civil unions as pope marks a milestone. When it comes to advancing sexual and reproductive rights, the Holy See consistently has sought to block rights recognised by international human rights law. It opposes abortion under all circumstances, opposes most forms of contraception, and uses its UN observer status to oppose any references to \u201cgender\u201d in UN resolutions and initiatives. Decades ago, it initiated a crusade against so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d that has morphed into a movement against women\u2019s rights and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender\u00a0(LGBT) people.\nFor the Catholic Church, consistent with a \u201clove the sinner, hate the sin\u201d adage central to its doctrine, \u201chomosexual acts are intrinsically disordered\u201d. From this perspective, homosexuality is a condition to be borne with grace, not an identity around which to claim equal rights. Yet the Vatican has taken a public stance against violence, criminal penalties, and unjust discrimination against homosexuals. And while these messages do not always resonate with the priesthood or laity, they have helped moderate zealous denunciation of homosexuality on religious grounds.\nWhile Pope Francis has not changed Catholic doctrine, he has consistently downplayed a moral emphasis on sexuality as the key issue of our time, suggesting instead that poverty and inequality, as well as climate catastrophes, are more pressing concerns. In that sense, he has opted out of one aspect of the culture wars in which homosexuality has been front and centre. One of the ways he has done this is to focus on individuals, not abstractions. His now-famous \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d remark to a journalist about gay priests, as well as support and encouragement to other LGBT\u00a0individuals in his purview, allows for individual empathy while rejecting gay rights.\nThe Catholic Church also faces practical challenges, given the growing diversity of families. The family ideal promoted by the church is increasingly divorced from lived reality. Increasingly, same-sex couples are raising children, which begs the question of how to include these families into the Catholic Church. The pope\u2019s acknowledgement that gay and lesbian people are \u201cchildren of God and have a right to a family\u201d echoes this long-standing dialogue. This message will be a balm for the disproportionate number of LGBT\u00a0youth who find themselves banished from their families and homeless.\nAt various points in time different social groups are banished from the body politic, creating a dichotomy between those who belong and those who do not, between insiders and outsiders, own and other. A characteristic of this tendency is to project negative, undesirable and threatening aspects of the social order onto an aberrant other. Given that nations are invariably imagined in symbols of sex and gender \u2013 represented by ideals of masculinity and femininity, with the conventional family as the building block of the nation, it is no wonder sexual minorities are one of those outsider groups blamed for a nation\u2019s ills.\nIn an era of globalisation, LGBT\u00a0rights have become a lightning rod for contestations over tradition and culture. Poland represents an extreme version, with local officials declaring many towns \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d. In Russia, the \u201cgay propaganda law\u201d is deployed as political shorthand to bolster conservative politics at home and position Russia as the defender of \u201ctraditional values\u201d abroad.\nThe propaganda-style laws initiated by Russia have been emulated elsewhere and represent a way of legislating away certain expressions of identity, seen as undesirable, and foreign to the cultural values of the nation. In Nigeria, a law that outlaws the expression of LGBT\u00a0identities is held up as a symbol of national sovereignty, as was Uganda\u2019s anti-homosexuality law.\nIn a world in which LGBT\u00a0rights have become a marker of modernity, the defence of \u201ctraditional values\u201d is almost invariably couched in terms of defending the family from the encroachment of modernity, and its perceived permissiveness. In Indonesia, LGBT\u00a0rights are seen as a foreign threat to hegemonic masculinity and to the nation. Egypt denounces \u201cWestern decadence\u201d as a rationale for prosecuting Egyptians on debauchery charges.\nThis rhetorical exclusion fails to recognise that local activists have developed a movement based on their own lives rather than echoing their Western counterparts. It also means LGBT\u00a0people are likely to be treated poorly, or even violently. In Russia, Chechen authorities justified the roundup, torture, and enforced disappearance of men assumed to be gay as a way of cleansing the nation, the latest in a long line of people whom the Chechen authorities see as socially undesirable.\nFrancis\u2019s moderating tone has shifted the conceptual landscape in which homosexuality is imagined and judged. His endorsement of civil unions takes this a step further. The pope is saying society will not fall, and will indeed be strengthened if the civil, secular law provides orderly recognition of same-sex relationships. That is a quantum leap. No wonder activists from countries such as Bolivia, the Philippines, Poland, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have welcomed his remarks. It is a \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d scenario, as Catholic doctrine remains unchanged, but what Pope Francis said on civil unions matters a great deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia Holy See \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 21, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nPope Francis Supports Same-Sex Civil Unions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2015\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nDispatches: Unholy Alliance for Slovakia\u2019s Referendum Risks Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 7, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cEvery Day I Live in Fear\u201d\n\n\nViolence and Discrimination Against LGBT People in  El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and  Obstacles to Asylum in the United States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThey Treated Us in Monstrous Ways\u201d\n\n\nSexual Violence Against Men, Boys, and Transgender Women in the Syrian Conflict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 21, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nPope Francis Supports Same-Sex Civil Unions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2015\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nDispatches: Unholy Alliance for Slovakia\u2019s Referendum Risks Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
