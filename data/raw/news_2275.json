(Photo by Sarah Webb)\nBy Lou Baldwin \u2022 Posted February 28, 2020 When one attends pro-life events in the Philadelphia area or even the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., it is easy to come away with the impression that the pro-life movement is just a Catholic thing, and no one else cares.\nThat is not as widespread as one might suspect.\nTake Scott Klusendorf, an Evangelical Christian who was the main speaker at the 32nd annual Celebrate Life Banquet held by Pennsylvanians for Human Life at the Springfield Country Club on Feb. 23.\n[hotblock]\nA graduate of UCLA who holds a master\u2019s degree in Christian apologetics from Biola University in Southern California, he has been a fighter for human life for three decades.\nNow 59 and living near Atlanta, Georgia, he and his wife Stephanie are parents of four children, Jeffrey, Tyler, Michael and Emily \u2014 \u201call pro-life,\u201d said their dad.\nHe has been a pro-life speaker for 30 years, and credits his own Christian commitment to his Chaucer professor at UCLA, who exposed him to the Christian theology underlying the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.\nMore specifically his own awakening to the pro-life issue came while he was an associate pastor at a church in Los Angeles and he heard a talk given by Gregg Cunningham, the founder of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform.\nScott Klusendorf, an Evangelical Christian pastor, speaks at the annual banquet of the Pennsylvanians for Human Life Feb. 23. (Sarah Webb)\n\u201cIt changed my life and I felt I had to do something about it,\u201d Klusendorf said. \u201cI felt I can\u2019t just pass on the other side of the road like the priest and the Levite did. I went home and told my wife my career was about to take a dramatic change. Six months later I started a ministry helping pro-life people making a difference in the public square.\u201d\nSince then he has spoken at more than 80 colleges and universities, countless Protestant and Catholic high schools and written extensively on the issue. As a matter of fact, the day after his talk at the Pennsylvanians for Human Life dinner, he gave talks at three archdiocesan Catholic high schools \u2013 Archbishop Carroll, Msgr. Bonner-Archbishop Prendergast and Cardinal O\u2019Hara.\nAmong the high schools he speaks at, probably 80 percent are Catholic, he estimated. But even among Catholic schools, not all welcome a pro-life speaker. \u201cThey give lip-service to pro-life but won\u2019t allow speakers,\u201d he said.\nInterestingly, in this post-Vatican II era when the different denominations including Catholic have been more open to ecumenism and dialogue, Evangelicals have been more wary of this than most.\n[hotblock2]\nHas this mutual opposition to abortion helped Evangelical-Catholic relations?\n\u201cAs a Protestant I am grateful for my Catholic friends who were in the forefront on this issue before Protestants were,\u201d Klusendorf said. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, without the Catholic influence the pro-life movement would have died. We can disagree on theological issues without demonizing each other. We can discuss them over beer and cigars then roll up our sleeves to help defend life.\u201d\nWhile Klusendorf has been teaching pro-life especially to mostly young people for three decades now, he admits he sometimes gets discouraged.\n\u201cBut I am persuaded I am required by God to speak truth whether the people are listening not, he said. \u201cGod told the prophet Jeremiah to go preach against child sacrifice (Jer. 19-5), and told him \u2018nobody is going to listen to you.\u2019\n\u201cMy job is more encouraging than the one he was given,\u201d Klusendorf said. \u201cMy job is to put a pebble in their shoe, something to think about after I am gone, maybe when they are facing a crisis, or a friend is considering an abortion. My job is to speak the truth and let God do the work.\u201d\nIt is the same as the work of Pennsylvanians for Human Life, which has been celebrating life for decades.\nAt this, their 32nd annual banquet, Dr. Monique Ruberu was honored with the Margaret Way Hoffner Award and Bradley V. O\u2019Brien received the organization\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award.\nLocal ob/gyn physician Dr. Monique Ruberu (center) receives the Margaret Way Hoffner Award Feb. 23 from the Pennsylvanians for Human Life, represented by Deacon Alvin Clay (left) and Tom Stevens, president and CEO of the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia.
