MICHAEL MICKLE | CATHOLIC VIRGINIAN\n  VAM4L-2022-64\n\u00ab\n\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSigns declaring \u201cThe future is anti-abortion\u201d and \u201cEquality begins in the womb\u201d were exclamation marks from the hundreds of people who gathered in downtown Richmond April 27 for the fourth annual Virginia March for Life.\u00a0\nThe crowd\u2019s enthusiasm was palpable as pro-lifers of all ages waited for the first of several speakers to take the podium.\nRichmond Bishop Barry C. Knestout provided opening remarks, telling those gathered that their advocacy on behalf of the unborn \u201cwas more necessary than ever.\u201d\nQuoting from a statement of the U.S. bishops, he said, \u201cAs our nation awaits the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, we join together in prayer and expectant hope that states will again be able to protect women and children from the injustice of abortion.\u201d\nFollowing his remarks, the bishop prayed, \u201cMay those, who you have granted the authority to govern, recognize the fundamental human right to life, that they use their positions to advance laws and policies that protect each person\u2019s right to life, from conception to natural death.\n\u201cLet your gentle hand, with all those who are instruments of your healing, aid women in pregnancy, especially those in the midst of crisis and doubt, to bring their children safe and sound to the light of day.\u201d\n\u2018Excitement, hope\u2019\nJeanne Mancini, March for Life president, said her biggest goal for the day was that \u201csomeone\u2019s heart is changed more in the direction of life.\u201d\nJust as important, she said, was for the state to \u201cmove in the direction of life, especially as it regards babies who receive a poor prenatal diagnosis.\u201d\nShe explained that Virginia allows more exceptions to abortion than many other states. Since April 27 was also Veto Day in Virginia, which relates to the state budget, marchers would be texting their legislators and \u201casking them to stop\u201d those exceptions.\nShe said that the beautiful weather was reminiscent of the first Virginia March for Life in 2018, but she noted that Virginia\u2019s current pro-life administration had made this year\u2019s event \u201cextra exciting.\u201d\nAmy McInerny, director of the diocesan Office of Respect Life, was encouraged by the march, yet noted that much work remains.\n\u201cThe Veto Day Virginia March for Life was a joyful, positive and uplifting witness to the sanctity of human life as Virginians from across the Commonwealth descended on Richmond to remind our legislators that we expect them to protect the vulnerable from the womb to the tomb,\u201d McInerny said. \u201cWe still have work to do to protect every Virginian so let\u2019s stay engaged.\u201d\nDue to construction on the capitol grounds, the March for Life rally, which preceded the march, was held at the bell tower on the lawn of Capitol Square.\nFor the first time, the state\u2019s governor was present at the Virginia March for Life. Gov. Glenn Youngkin joined the march as the crowd left Capitol Square.\nJoan Andres, a parishioner of St. Andrew the Apostle Church in Clifton, believes \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of work to do, especially in the state,\u201d but felt that the governor\u2019s presence was a \u201csource of a lot of excitement and hope.\u201d\n\u201cWe have more hope now than we\u2019ve had in a long time, so I think that the Holy Spirit is at work,\u201d she said.\nConnor Mancuso attended the Virginia March for Life for the first time; he has attended the national march twice.\n\u201cI believe that our actions here will imprint upon others who see us that we are trying to make a difference\u2026 and show that all life is sacred, all life is unique, all life is valuable,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Protecting the innocent\u2019\nAttending his first March for Life, Joe Deffner, a parishioner of St. Thomas More Church in Lynchburg, said he admires Abby Johnson\u2019s pro-life conversion after the \u201cwake-up call that only the Lord can give you \u2014 and prayers.\u201d\n\u201cI admire her stance and the grief that she took when she made that change of faith,\u201d he said of the former Planned Parenthood employee.\nHe was joined by his brother, Bill Deffner, who was visiting from Portersville, Pa.\n\u201cI traveled to Richmond because I get the opportunity to spend some time with my brother and drag him to the March for Life,\u201d he said as Joe laughed.\nBill added, \u201cIt\u2019s energizing to see the excitement in the youth because they\u2019re all survivors.\u201d\n\u201cIt really is all about pro-life and really protecting the most innocent and the most vulnerable, which are the unborn. It\u2019s life at all levels from conception to the grave,\u201d said Robert McBride, pro-life director of St. Michael Church\u2019s Knights of Columbus council in Glen Allen.\nMcBride called the nearly 1 million babies lost to abortion in the U.S. each year \u201ca tragedy,\u201d and said he believes one solution could be \u201ca matter of education\u201d for people to fully understand what happens when a baby is conceived.\n\u201cIt really is a matter of human dignity at all levels,\u201d he said. \u201cThe loss of life, in particular among minorities and young women \u2014\u00a0 those are the groups targeted, literally targeted, by Planned Parenthood especially\u2026 it\u2019s an abomination.\u201d\nLiving the faith\nAndres brought her 10- and 8-year-old daughters to the rally and march to make \u201cthe treasure of human life normal to them so there\u2019s never a doubt in their mind what truth is.\u201d\nMagdalena Brier, parishioner of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in Lake Ridge, also brought her two daughters, ages 9 and 7, to the march and rally \u2014 the first March for Life she has attended.\n\u00a0\u201cSo, this year in particular, after home-schooling for the last two years, it just makes everything come together. And it\u2019s not just something that\u2019s happening far away; it\u2019s something that we talk about all the time with our faith, so it\u2019s great to be able to come out and live that faith.\u201d\nWilliam Clough, a student at Virginia Commonwealth University who attends the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, said that he was \u201cmarching to help end abortion and save the lives of many infants in our country and especially the state.\u201d\nClough, whose home parish is St. Agnes in Arlington, said it saddens him to know that \u201cmany children won\u2019t be able to live life\u201d due to abortion, but he hopes that rallies like the one held in Richmond will continue to have a positive impact upon society.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that if we pray hard enough and we have a big rally, that hopefully we can overturn Roe v. Wade soon,\u201d he said.\nReynolds writes for the Catholic Virginian, the official publication of the Diocese of Richmond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTopics: Pro-Life \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorto Charities donates $200,000 to diocesan schools \n\n\n\n3/18/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     1\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual diocesan Women\u2019s Conference reminds women of their unique identity \n\n\n\n3/14/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     5\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Patrick Irish Hooley benefits Christ House \n\n\n\n3/13/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     1\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to eNewsletter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArlington Catholic Herald200 N.
