Subscribe to our daily newsletter.\nAmericans have become more supportive of abortion rights over time, and it\u2019s not necessarily tied to the Supreme Court case last summer that overturned federal abortion rights, according to a new study.\nThe nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) released a report Thursday that shows support for abortion legality in all or most cases has risen since 2010, with a notable increase beginning in 2020. Fifteen percent of Americans believed in 2010 that abortion should be illegal in all cases \u2014 an opinion that only 7 percent of Americans held at the end of 2022.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report summarizes recent results from the American Values Atlas, an annual survey by PRRI. This year\u2019s survey was conducted online from March to December 2022, and the report also includes findings from a one-off survey in June. The main survey has a nationally representative sample size of 22,984 adults in all states and the District of Columbia. The margin of error is 0.8 percentage points.\nPRRI\u2019s more extensive survey shows abortion attitudes haven\u2019t changed much since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling in June that effectively repealed Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that gave people the right to an abortion. Sixty-four percent of Americans surveyed in March 2022 said they felt abortion should be legal. In June, that figure was 65 percent. Surveys fielded in August, September and December showed a variance of only a few percentage points.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More abortion coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    In Florida, 1 in 10 minors are denied abortions by judges\n                \n\n\n\n                    Americans don\u2019t know if abortion is legal in their state, new poll shows\n                \n\n\n\n                    Abortion rights leaders set focus on access, medication \u2014 and the long fight ahead\n                \n\n\n\n\nAs previous polling has shown, Americans across many demographic groups support abortion legality in all or most cases. The majority of all racial and ethnic groups support abortion rights, and those views didn\u2019t change over 2022.\nThe report also shows that a vast majority of LGBTQ+ Americans support abortion rights in all or most cases (83 percent), compared with 63 percent of cisgender heterosexual Americans. The majority of women and men also support abortion in all or most cases (65 percent and 62 percent respectively). There is no nonbinary data in the survey report.\nThe data reveals the increase in support for abortion legality has been driven in part by Democrats: In 2010, Democrats\u2019 support for abortion in most or all cases was at 71 percent. Throughout 2022, the vast majority of Democrats (86 percent) said abortion should be legal in most or all cases.\u00a0\nThe survey, like much abortion polling, asks respondents whether they think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases. The categories are vague, Melissa Deckman, CEO of PRRI, says, and the option of \u201cillegal in most cases\u201d tends to mean bans with exceptions, not necessarily limited at a gestational age.\u00a0\n\u201cI do think there is a longer trend of especially Democratic Americans \u2014 big D partisanship \u2014 in terms of that we see more support for abortion rights in general,\u201d said Deckman.\nBut Republicans have also become less supportive of complete abortion bans over time. Today, only 14 percent want abortion completely outlawed, compared with 22 percent in 2010. There is a slight gender difference throughout 2022: Throughout the course of the year, Republican women became less likely to support total bans (20 percent down to 15 percent) while Republican men mostly stayed the same (15 percent down to 13 percent).\nThe most striking difference on abortion opinion between age groups is the share of Americans who support abortion in all cases. Thirty-eight percent of people ages 18-29 support abortion legality in all cases, and that support declines in older age groups. Among the next age group, 30-49-year-olds, 29 percent support abortion in all cases.\n\n\n\nAround one in 10 young people think abortion should be outlawed in all cases. It\u2019s a small amount that doesn\u2019t seem to be growing, Deckman said.\nDeckman added that it\u2019s \u201cinstructive\u201d that more Americans are less supportive of total abortion bans given that several states have such a policy in place following the Dobbs decision.\n\u201cThey're not even reflecting public opinion in their own states,\u201d she said. No state had more than 14 percent of people indicating support for total abortion bans, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.\nIn fact, the majority of Americans (53 percent) are in favor of Congress passing a law to preserve the right to abortion. Only one-third of Americans (31 percent) said that abortion law should be left to the states, and 12 percent said Congress should pass a national ban. PRRI asked this question in a separate survey of 2,030 Americans, right after the Dobbs verdict was announced in June. The margin of error was 2.3 percentage points.\nThe opinions are polarized along party lines, with 78 percent of Democrats saying Congress should pass a law protecting abortion. Half of Republicans said that abortion laws should be dictated by the states, while 22 percent expressed support for a national ban. Independents were more in favor of a national law protecting abortion, with over half agreeing, while 34 percent said it should be determined by the states.\nHow a candidate views abortion may also play a role in how Americans vote in the future, at least for Democrats, according to the survey. In 2022, 26 percent of all Americans who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases said they will only vote for a candidate who shares their view on abortion \u2014 an increase from 15 percent in 2020. For Democrats, that figure doubled from 17 percent in 2020 to 34 percent in 2022; for Republicans who said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, the trend is going in the opposite direction: down 12 percentage points from 42 percent in 2020 to 30 percent in 2022.\n\u201cFor Democrats who are very supportive of abortion rights or lean in that direction, this has suddenly become a much more important issue,\u201d Deckman said. \u201cAnd I think we saw some of that anecdotally \u2026 in the midterms, where abortion became a flashpoint.\u201d\nThere was also a difference in the importance of a candidate\u2019s abortion stance between men and women. Women were more likely than men to say they will only vote for candidates who share their views on abortion (29 percent vs. 22 percent). While the gender differences held true across ages, young women were more likely to say so. \u201cWhat we're seeing here is that for younger women, especially women of childbearing age, [abortion] is more important to them as an election issue, especially for those who are more supportive of abortion rights,\u201d Deckman said. \u201cWhereas with men, it's not factoring in nearly as much.\u201d\nThe survey also examined how religious beliefs impact abortion attitudes. Thirty-one percent of Americans say that their religious faith dictates their views on abortion. But over half of Republicans (52 percent) say their opinions on abortion are tied to their faith, compared with 26 percent of Democrats and 20 percent of Independents.\nAbortion rights have support across the majority of different faiths. With a few exceptions \u2014 White evangelical Protestants, Latinx Protestants, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Mormons \u2014 the majority of each faith group analyzed by PRRI supported abortion legality in all or most cases.\u00a0\n\u201cI think this study shows that most people of faith, those people that identify with a religion, tend to actually be more likely to favor abortion rights as opposed to favor restrictions,\u201d said Deckman.\u00a0\n\u201cI know from doing other analyses, social science research, peer-reviewed journal articles, \u2026 religiosity still matters when it comes to explaining abortion, even considering partisanship and other other kinds of factors,\u201d she said.\nStill, Deckman had some context for the intersection of party affiliation and religion. Some Republicans are more likely to be religious. And while some Democrats are also religious, particularly people of color, there is an increasing number of people who are unaffiliated with a religion.\n\u201cThose overlapping identities over time have meant that the partisanship and the religiosity combined together to help inform views of abortion, and why it is that on the right at least, the Republican Party has become so adamantly opposed to abortion \u2026 even to the extent of adopting unpopular policies broadly,\u201d she said. \u201cMost Americans don't think we should ban abortion, but yet, we're in a situation where state legislatures have done that very thing.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion isn\u2019t the top voting issue for most Americans.
