OHSU\u2019s reproductive health curriculum includes abortion care. Because of abortion bans in certain states, OB/GYN residents aren\u2019t able to train in this basic piece of their education in their home states. (OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks)\n\nOregon Health & Science University\u2019s Center for Women\u2019s Health this fall welcomed its first visiting medical resident from out of state to receive specialized training in abortion care.\nThe physician-in-training, who remains anonymous for safety reasons, was not able to receive the training within her own obstetrics and gynecology residency program, due to a statewide abortion ban \u2014 which puts her and her institution at risk of being charged with a felony.\nHer training at OHSU was sponsored by the Abortion Care and Training Fund, or ACT Fund, which helps ensure the next generation of clinicians knows how to perform essential reproductive health services.\nAs many states crack down on reproductive health care with restrictive laws, medical residents across the country who are pursuing careers in obstetrics and gynecology are no longer able to complete the necessary education and training in their own states. This dangerous new reality led OHSU to spearhead a unique program, supported by the ACT Fund, that allows out-of-state residents to receive education and training for abortion care in Oregon from OHSU\u2019s family planning team.\nDuring their time at OHSU, visiting residents gain hands-on experience with various procedures and surgeries, and learn how to effectively counsel various patient populations so they\u2019re able to make educated, informed decisions about their patients\u2019 sexual and reproductive health.\n\nAlyssa Colwill, M.D. (OHSU)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really frightening reality we\u2019re living in,\u201d said Alyssa Colwill, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the OHSU School of Medicine, who leads the OB/GYN Ryan Residency Program at OHSU, which teaches medical fellows, residents and students complex contraception and abortion care. \u201cIf medical students and residents aren\u2019t able to learn these skills \u2014 which should be considered very basic, standard practices \u2014 they won\u2019t be able to properly care for patients. This goes far beyond just the states with abortion bans; it is truly a threat to women\u2019s health care everywhere.\u201d\nOHSU is committed to providing the full continuum of sexual and reproductive health care \u2014 including abortion \u2014 to all who seek it. Colwill emphasizes how essential it is to educate the next generation of clinicians. She also acknowledges the increased responsibility OHSU has, along with other reproductive health care providers in Oregon, to ensure people from outside the state are also able to access the critical care they need.\nNew reality for residents in obstetrics and gynecology\nAbortion bans have been a significant setback for residents who have worked for years to pursue careers in medicine, and specifically in women\u2019s health.\n\u201cWhen I found out that Roe v. Wade fell, I was horrified,\u201d the visiting resident said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a doctor. As a woman, I felt my bodily rights were being taken away, as well as my career. My path changed overnight.\u201d\nWhile she\u2019s grateful that OHSU created the program and opportunity, she notes that getting to that point was difficult, both logistically and emotionally.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the biggest feeling I\u2019ve had around this opportunity is fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI fear that I could jeopardize my own standing in residency, jeopardize funding for my institution, or jeopardize my colleagues and their opportunity to do something like this in the future.\u201d\nDespite the challenges to get to OHSU and the inherent risk in participating in the program, the resident says the training exceeded her expectations and provided a welcome reprieve from the harsh new reality of sexual and reproductive health care in the Unites States.\n\u201cI feel like OHSU is such an oasis for patients who want and need this care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a refreshing perspective to be in a place with no judgment and such strong support around this type of health care.\u201d\nThe ACT Fund is made possible by community support and philanthropy. The funding supports and provides continued training opportunities for OHSU\u2019s dedicated clinicians and advocates \u2014 especially those practicing in states where training has or will be banned or restricted. The opportunity to learn at OHSU also gives hope to many aspiring health care professionals who simply want to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\u201cDespite the uphill battle we are fighting, I am fired up and want to make a difference in the situation,\u201d the resident said. \u201cEven though it will be immensely more difficult now, I\u2019m more motivated than ever to pursue a path in women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Story  Oregon governor declares RSV in children a public health emergency\n\n\n\nNext Story OHSU-developed brain surgery simulator proves valuable in nationwide test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact\n\n\n\nNicole Rideout\nSenior Media Relations Specialist\nOHSU\n503-494-8231\n Email Nicole\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Alyssa Colwill, M.D.\n                  \n\nAlyssa Colwill, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the OHSU School of Medicine, who leads the OB/GYN Ryan\u00a0 Residency Program at OHSU, which teaches medical fellows, residents and students complex contraception and abortion care.
