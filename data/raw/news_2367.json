After a much-loved career, I felt called to make a change so as to reach a wider audience with the pro-life message. This decision brought me to Save the Storks, a pro-life organization that\u2019s changing how we view and approach the abortion issue.\nAt Save the Storks, you won\u2019t find us using condemnation, judgement, shame or guilt to engage in conversation over this sensitive issue. We believe hearts and minds will only change through civil conversations, education, love, and compassion.\nOur organization\u2019s founders set out to create a pro-life ministry that would revolutionize the pro-life movement. When they did, Save the Storks was born.\nSave the Storks partners with local PRC\u2019s across the country to help them go \u201cmobile.\u201d We assist in the fundraising process to enable pregnancy centers to build their own unique mobile medical units (MMU\u2019s), which we fondly call, \u201cStork Buses.\u201d\nwww.savethestorks.org\nThe local PRC operates the bus in their community and decide where to place it. The majority of buses are parked near college campuses and abortion facilities. Most buses provide free pregnancy tests and ultrasounds. The services are free, confidential, and operated by the local PRC staff, who offer help and hope \u2013 never scare tactics, shame, or condemnation.\nSince Save the Storks\u2019 inception, over 8,000 babies have been saved and thousands of parents-to-be won\u2019t have to live with the negative effects of abortion. The numbers speak for themselves \u2013 four out of five women who board a Stork Bus choose life for their babies. It\u2019s hard to deny a heartbeat.\n\nwww.savethestorks.org\nBut even better, when these mothers choose life, they now have an ally in their local PRC to help with the resources they need, including; pregnancy clothing, counseling, parenting classes, financial planning, cribs, car seats, diapers, formula, and baby clothing.\nNow more than ever, we\u2019re seeing hearts and minds of all ages changed by the power of respectful conversation and education. I\u2019m convinced that the next generation will be the one to usher in a pro-life society. Save the Storks truly believes as the pro-life community continues to work together, we will see abortion become unthinkable in our lifetime.\n\n Post Views: 1,485\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
