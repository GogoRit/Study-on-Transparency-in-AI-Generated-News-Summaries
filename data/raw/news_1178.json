The measure would have imposed even heavier penalties for doctors and others who assist women in ending pregnancies.\n\nAbortions are legal in Guatemala only when the life of a woman is at risk.The legislation also explicitly prohibited same-sex marriage \u2014 which was already effectively illegal \u2014 and banned schools from teaching anything that could \u201cdeviate (a child\u2019s) identity according to their birth gender.\u201dSome of Latin America\u2019s largest countries \u2014 Mexico, Argentina, Colombia \u2014 have expanded abortion access in the past two years, but conservative religious trends continue to hold sway in parts of the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
