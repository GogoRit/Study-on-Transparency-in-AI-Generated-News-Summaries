Wade world, people seeking to end the death penalty have no prospect of winning in the Supreme Court. And much like those activists, the movement to abolish the death penalty has had to adapt its strategy.\nAs Sarah Kliff observed at Vox, the pro-life movement experimented with different ways of accomplishing this goal, \u201cwhether targeting abortion providers, their clinics, or the procedures a woman has to go through before terminating a pregnancy.\u201d\nAnd in state after state, the anti-abortion movement succeeded.\nToday, death penalty abolitionists are trying to do something similar. Just as the pro-life movement has, unfortunately for women across the country, been successful in slowing or stopping them from exercising their legal rights and obtaining abortions, the gradualist, incremental strategy of death penalty abolitionists shows great promise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Slatest Newsletter\nA\u00a0daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\n\n\n        Thanks for signing up!

Another is to mount vigorous, extended court battles to save or delay the execution of particular capital defendants.\nAnother key, and novel, part of the effort is convincing prosecutors\u2014seemingly unlikely allies\u2014not to bring capital cases.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the movement succeeded in doing just that. On Feb. 17, 56 prosecutors from across the country issued a joint statement saying that \u201cour country\u2019s system of capital punishment is broken. It is time to work together toward systemic changes that will bring about the elimination of the death penalty nationwide.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement marks a watershed moment in the struggle to end the death penalty in the United States.\nProsecutors play a key, but sometimes underappreciated, role throughout America\u2019s criminal justice system. They have virtually unlimited discretion to decide whether to initiate or proceed with any criminal case. Then\u2013Attorney General Robert Jackson got it right when in 1940 he said that the \u201cprosecutor has more power over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America,\u201d and that \u201chis discretion is tremendous.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is true in other parts of the justice system is also true in capital cases. Prosecutors make the critical choice of whether or not to charge an offender with an offense that carries the possibility of a death sentence. And \u201cdespite the grave implications of this decision,\u201d as Jonathan DeMay wrote in Fordham Urban Law Journal years ago, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has never required that any procedures or guidelines be promulgated to control the process employed by prosecutors to reach this decision.\u201d\nAccording to the educational group Capital Punishment in Context, \u201cthe financial resources available in a jurisdiction, the views of constituents and the local political climate, and the prosecutor\u2019s own views can affect the likelihood a defendant will face the death sentence.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nSo great is this prosecutorial power that some opponents of capital punishment argue that \u201cwhether someone is sentenced to death has become more a function of the prosecutor on their case than the severity of their crime.\u201d\u00a0Even when they use this power in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner or engage in egregious misconduct, they are rarely disciplined by either the bar or the courts.\nA 2016 report by Harvard Law School\u2019s Fair Punishment Project found that just five prosecutors\u2014Joe Freeman Britt of Robeson County,\u00a0North Carolina; Robert Macy of Oklahoma County,\u00a0Oklahoma; Donald Myers of the 11th Judicial District of\u00a0South Carolina; Lynne Abraham of Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania; and Johnny Holmes of Harris County,\u00a0Texas\u2014were \u201cresponsible for more than 440 death sentences, the equivalent of 15 percent of the entire U.S. death row population today.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter each of those prosecutors left office, the number of death sentences in the jurisdictions they served declined significantly.\nLast week\u2019s joint statement was signed by prosecutors from metropolitan and rural counties in 26 states, 11 of which currently have the death penalty. The statement acknowledged that those who signed it \u201chold varied opinions surrounding the death penalty and hail from jurisdictions with different starting points on the propriety of this sentence.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nYet they joined forces in endorsing a wide range of abolitionist arguments. \u201cWe have a capital punishment system,\u201d their statement noted, \u201cthat costs taxpayers over $1 million per death sentence, runs counter to our constitutional ban against cruel and unusual punishment and guarantees of due process and equal protection, fails as an effective deterrent, and does not reduce crime.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prosecutors also acknowledged the disparities inherent in capital punishment cases, noting:\n\nThe death penalty still targets not the worst of the worst, but rather the unluckiest of the unluckiest: people who endured sexual abuse and other unspeakable trauma as children; people with long histories of severe mental illness or traumatic brain injuries \u2026 people who committed crimes during a psychotic break they can\u2019t even remember; people who, because of incomplete cognitive development or other intellectual disability, have never been able to fully function as adults; people with trial lawyers so derelict in their duties and obligations that they never bothered to uncover long histories of illness and trauma. This, tragically, is the profile of death row in America.\n\nThe 56 prosecutors pledged not to seek the death penalty \u201cagainst individuals with cognitive impairments or otherwise diminished culpability.\u201d They also said they would \u201cwork toward the elimination of our nation\u2019s failed death penalty system, once and for all.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\nOther prosecutors have gone further, and announced that they will no longer bring capital prosecutions under any circumstances. In September, Utah prosecutor David Leavitt made headlines when he said his office would no longer seek the death penalty in any case. He explained that \u201cinnocent people have been executed and that the penalty of death has been carried out inconsistently and discriminatorily.\u00a0What we have also learned is that the death penalty does not promote community safety. It is not an effective deterrent. It simply demonstrates our societal preference for retribution over public safety.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty years ago this year, the United States Supreme Court brought a temporary halt to the death penalty when it ruled that it could not be squared with the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and guarantee of equal treatment under the law. That decision represented the culmination of a campaign to put litigation at the center of abolitionist strategy and the hope for a sweeping, top-down end to capital punishment. But the decision did not hold.\nToday the strategy to end capital punishment is much less focused on the Supreme Court. Rather, and much like what the movement to stop abortion did until just recently, it aims one step, one jurisdiction, at a time to bring the machinery of death to a halt.\nEnlisting prosecutors to join in this work is one mark of its success.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Constitution\n            \n\n\n              Criminal Justice\n            \n\n\n              Death Penalty\n            \n\n\n              Supreme Court\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
