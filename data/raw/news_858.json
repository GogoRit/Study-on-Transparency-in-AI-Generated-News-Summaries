Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.By Caroline KitchenerDec. 1 at 6:00 a.m.Share this storyIt\u2019s a moment of panic that has played out again and again for people in more than a dozen states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.Once they find out they\u2019re pregnant, there isn\u2019t much time to act. The closest open abortion clinics that once offered next-day appointments are now often fully booked three, four, even five weeks in advance. Pills purchased online can take up to a month to arrive.Every day, the fetus gets a little bigger \u2014 and the anxiety builds.In polarized, post-Roe America, the experiences that draw widespread attention are often the most harrowing: a 10-year-old rape victim forced to leave her state to end her pregnancy, or a woman denied an abortion for a fetus without a skull.Often lost in the discussion are the more routine stories. The mother of two who can\u2019t afford a third child. The teenager who can\u2019t tell her parents she\u2019s pregnant. The 25-year-old who isn\u2019t ready to be a mom.Over the next decade, if recent trends hold, more than a million people with unwanted pregnancies are likely to run up against an abortion ban. Some will find a way, traveling hundreds of miles or securing illegal pills through the mail. Others will resign themselves to parenthood.The Washington Post made contact with three pregnant women who were seeking abortions while living in states with strict abortion bans. These women, reached early in their pregnancies, communicated regularly with The Post, sharing their experiences through calls, text messages and other documentation that supported their accounts. They participated on the condition that only their first names be used to protect their privacy.Here are their stories, from the minute the two pink lines appeared.Lillith17, OklahomaLillith rolled into the emergency room in a wheelchair, her cramps so bad she could no longer stand up.The pain had been building for a few weeks, mild at first, then suddenly sharp enough to wake her up every day at 5 a.m. Weighing just 95 pounds, Lillith assumed it was some kind of nutrition issue: Maybe she wasn\u2019t eating the right foods, or enough of them.Then a nurse pressed an ultrasound probe into her stomach and informed her that she was almost 20 weeks pregnant.\u201cYou can put this in your baby book,\u201d the doctor said as he handed her the results of the pregnancy test.Lillithburstintotears.She knew all about the recent Supreme Court decision that had banned abortion across much of the South. As a teenage girl in Oklahoma \u2014 where abortion is now almost entirely illegal \u2014 you had to keep track of these things, she said.Lillith looked at her dad in the chair next to her, his eyes wide. As comfortable as they were with each other, with just the two of them living at home, she could tell this news had thrown him. Still, he reached out to hold her hand.\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d her dad recalled saying once they got in the car. While he would need some time to process \u2014 he wanted to take a close look at the ultrasound of the fetus and learn the gender \u2014 he promised he would support whatever decision his daughter made.Before the positive test, Lillith hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility that she could be pregnant. She\u2019d been on birth control until a few months earlier, when her prescription lapsed and she hadn\u2019t prioritized going back to the doctor. She only had sex once every few months \u2014 casual hook ups with a friend \u2014 so birth control hadn\u2019t seemed that important, she recalled thinking.Lillith waited until her dad went to sleep that night to start researching abortion clinics. She would have to drive three hours to Kansas or eight hours to New Mexico, the closest states where abortion was legal. At 20 weeks along, a surgical procedure would cost over $1,000, on top of the price of gas and a hotel.Her job at a sandwich shop paid $9.25 an hour.Just after midnight, Lillith texted her best friend. Their messages were usually silly and low-stakes, easy banter about their next TikTok video or which shade of orange would look best in Lillith\u2019s hair. Nothing like the news she was about to share.Lillith started to panic even more the next morning, once she started making calls. Kansas wasn\u2019t an option: Lillith couldn\u2019t find an appointment there for another two or three weeks, which would put her beyond the state\u2019s 22-week limit.The wait in New Mexico would be long, too. When one clinic told her they would have to induce labor and deliver a stillborn \u2014 their standard practice for someone 23 weeks along \u2014 Lillith said she started hyperventilating. She could not imagine pushing a fully formed baby out of her tiny body. Childbirth scared her so much, she said, she\u2019d always planned to adopt.Lillith couldn\u2019t stop fixating on the fetus inside her. Roughly the size of a mango, it kept growing as she spent her nights at home, knowing her friends were out drinking until 4 a.m., thoroughly enjoying the summer after their senior year.She finally got good news a few days after her first round of calls, when a New Mexico clinic reached out with an open appointment the following week.Once she started looking, she couldn\u2019t believe how easy it was to find the money. A quick internet search led her to the National Abortion Federation and its Hotline Fund, a nonprofit backed largely by billionaire Warren Buffett, which agreed to cover the full cost of her $2,400 procedure, she said. She just had to get herself to New Mexico.Lillith and her dad started the eight-hour drive at 5 a.m., a cooler in the back seat stocked with Pringles and pudding cups. In her comfiest sweatpants and Crocs, Lillith recalled, she closed her eyes right around the one-hour mark, drifting off to Bon Jovi and AC/DC, a soothing mix of what she liked to call \u201cdad rock.\u201dThe procedure itself took two days. Because Lillith was further along in her pregnancy, the doctor had to insert dilation sticks to soften and open the cervix, before starting the abortion about 24 hours later.When Lillith woke up after the procedure, she said later, her dad was there waiting for her. One day, she thought she might ask him whether the little thing inside her had been a boy or a girl.But for now, she decided, she didn\u2019t need to know.Kae24, OhioKae drove to her ultrasound appointment with one question on her mind: Did her fetus have a heartbeat?She\u2019d scheduled her scan at a facility that offered \u201cabortion consultations\u201d as soon as she found out she was pregnant, well aware that she was up against a deadline. An Ohio law, which took effect when Roe fell and would later be blocked at least temporarily in the courts, banned abortion as soon as an ultrasound could detect cardiac activity, around six weeks of pregnancy.If she\u2019d been tracking her period correctly, she only had a few days to get an abortion.When Kae pulled into the parking lot for her appointment, she was surprised to find it free of protesters. While the place she\u2019d selected didn\u2019t actually provide abortions, its website advertised free ultrasounds and other services for women seeking the procedure. With the Supreme Court decision so fresh and emotions raw, Kae figured any kind of abortion-friendly place would be a target.Right away, Kae said, a few things seemed a little off. One counselor gave her a bottle of prenatal vitamins. Another offered to pray for her. Then the sonographer said the vaginal ultrasound wasn\u2019t clear enough to date the pregnancy: Kae would have to come back in a week.\u201cYou can\u2019t give me an estimate?\u201d Kae asked, fairly sure she was at least five weeks along. \u201cNothing?\u201dAt Kae\u2019s next appointment \u2014 seven days after her first \u2014 the sonographer played a sound she identified as a heartbeat.\u201cYou\u2019re measuring at approximately six weeks and three days,\u201d Kae recalled the sonographer saying as Kae lay flat on the exam table.Kaecouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099tbelievewhatshewashearing.\u201cDo you want a picture to take home?\u201d Kae recalled the sonographer asking.No, Kae thought to herself: All she wanted was to put her pants back on and leave. She stared up at the ceiling, trying to tune out the sound and keep her breath steady. How could this be happening, she wondered? How had the fetus developed so quickly?A one week delay was the difference between a legal and an illegal abortion.By that point, Kae said, she\u2019d started to suspect that the clinic was not an abortion-friendly place at all. She\u2019d heard people talk about crisis pregnancy centers, often religiously-affiliated organizations that try to talk women out of abortions.A sonographer can see a gestational sac with a vaginal ultrasound around four to five weeks of pregnancy, according to a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which means they can roughly identify the pregnancy one to two weeks before cardiac activity is detected.When Kae told her boyfriend the news, he was immediately suspicious, pointing to the pregnancy center\u2019s clear antiabortion stance. \u201cTo go from seeing nothing to being too far in a week, it just didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he told The Post.There had been a moment, right after the pregnancy test, when Kae briefly considered keeping the baby. She\u2019d been with her boyfriend for almost a year. He owned a home. She had no doubt he was the guy she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. But Kae had just gone back for her college degree, still a few years away from launching her dream career.When she sat down to write her list of pros and cons, she could only think of one \u201cpro\u201d: the chance to start a family with her boyfriend. Meanwhile, the \u201ccons\u201d quickly filled a whole page in her notebook.Kae felt even more sure of her decision after hearing what the counselors called the \u201cheartbeat.\u201d She didn\u2019t feel at all attached to the sound, she said. Angry that the pregnancy center may have tried to thwart her plans, she informed the counselors that she still planned to have an abortion. She would take pills from Aid Access, she told them, a Europe-based online service that supplies abortion pills illegally to women in states where abortion is banned.\u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s in them,\u201d Kae recalls one of the counselors saying before she fled the building. (Aid Access is widely regarded in the medical community as a safe resource for medication abortion.)Kae heard the counselor\u2019s voice in her head when the abortion pills arrived in the mail a week later. Some of the pills were small and hexagonal, she said, while others were more circular.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re different,\u201d she told her boyfriend. \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201dKae holds the abortion pill box that arrived in the mail. (Courtesy of Kae)He said he reminded her that she\u2019d done her homework: She\u2019d read a bunch of articles about Aid Access before she paid $105 to place her order. The organization had been around for years. If these were the pills that arrived, he told Kae, they should trust them.The next few hours played out exactly as the internet had led Kae to expect. The cramps came, sharp and fast, as she curled up on the couch with her golden retriever, trying to concentrate on an episode of \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d She threw up a few times, then turned on the shower, the hot water dulling the ache in her back.When Kae imagined all she might lose by having a baby, she thought about roller coasters and the kind of reckless freedom they represented. She loved the feeling of the wind in her hair and her hands in the sky, screaming as she plummeted 300 feet at 100 miles an hour.She\u2019d already planned a post-abortion amusement park trip with her friends, where they would ride one of the tallest, fastest coasters in the state.\u201cSuck it up,\u201d she said out loud to herself, fixating on the dips and drops she could experience once she was no longer pregnant. \u201cJust a few more hours to go.\u201dTaylor27, GeorgiaTaylor checked the time as soon as she woke up on the morning of her abortion appointment. It was 6 a.m. The clinic expected her at 8:10 a.m.She had just over two hours to decide whether she wanted to become a mom.When Taylor first found out she was pregnant, she had not even considered keeping the baby. Her boyfriend of two months had just moved 600 miles away. She had no savings. After working as a greeter in a fancy downtown office building, she\u2019d finally scored an entry-level job in finance making $50,000 a year. But she had to pass an exam to stay on the payroll, and the studying had not been going well.Based on her last period, Taylor estimated that she was at least seven weeks into her pregnancy, too far along to get an abortion in Georgia, which had enacted a \u201cheartbeat ban.\u201dShe would have to go to Florida.Taylor knew she was in for a long wait. She couldn\u2019t take any time off at her new job, so she could only travel to Florida on weekends. Flooded with patients from states that had banned abortion, the clinic\u2019s earliest available Saturday appointment was two weeks away. Because Florida law requires patients to have an in-state ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion \u2014 and the clinic wasn\u2019t open on Sundays \u2014 Taylor would have to make two trips.She secured a pair of Saturday time slots at a Florida Planned Parenthood: one for the ultrasound and another, three weeks later, for the abortion. Her boyfriend, who Taylor said advocated for the abortion, agreed to cover half the cost of the $250 round trip flights.It wasn\u2019t until the ultrasound that Taylor started to wonder whether she was making the right decision. As the nurse walked her through a script of state-mandated information, describing every step of the surgical procedure, Taylor seized on a few of the details.A tube inserted inside her uterus. A pump. Suction.Taylor said she had only ever thought about abortion in a vague, abstract kind of way, as a medical procedure central to reproductive health care. Now she couldn\u2019t stop picturing a vacuum cleaner inside her vagina.The ultrasound photo made her even more anxious. At nine weeks, she said, the fetus \u201clooked like a little person.\u201dTaylor holds the photo from her ultrasound appointment. (Courtesy of Taylor)After returning home from her first trip to Florida, Taylor spent hours scouring the internet for information: How much do you bleed in a surgical abortion? Do fetuses feel pain?Eager for a sympathetic ear, Taylor posted in an antiabortion forum she found online.\u201cI am pro-choice and I\u2019m weirdly having second thoughts about my appointment next week,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAdvice???\u201dHer post quickly generated over 100 responses.Money wouldn\u2019t be a problem, promised dozens of people Taylor had never met: There were resources for mothers like her. They told her to call her local crisis pregnancy center. Several users offered to donate to Taylor\u2019s baby registry. One asked for her address so she could send some baby clothes.\u201cThe feelings you have right now is your conscience telling you something isn\u2019t right,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cIt is very likely that you will feel worse if you have the abortion.\u201dTaylor wasn\u2019t sure whether she could rely on these strangers, or the resources they touted. But she was desperate for some kind of support, and she wanted to believe them.As the appointment neared, Taylor still couldn\u2019t settle on what she should do. She texted her boyfriend at 2:30 a.m. on the morning of her flight to Florida.Taylor told herself she would make up her mind once she packed her bags. Once she got to the airport. Once she landed.Then it was 7:30 a.m. on the day of her appointment, and she finally accepted that she wasn\u2019t going to get out of bed.Inafewmonths,shewouldbecomeamom.As soon as she got back to Georgia, Taylor started to shop. She would swing by Target after work and linger in the baby aisle, picking up wipes or a few packs of diapers, eyeing the other women with rounded bellies as they filled their carts with everything you needed to care for a child.Taylor felt like she was playing a part. She said she had just started renting her first apartment. She didn\u2019t know how to drive. In a few weeks, she might fail her company\u2019s required exam and lose her job. Still, she thought, maybe if she did the things mothers were supposed to do \u2014 bought the things mothers were supposed to buy \u2014 she could somehow handle this.\u201cI don\u2019t really have control of anything right now,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s nice to know, okay, I have the stuff.\u201dAbout two and a half months later, by then 22 weeks into her pregnancy, Taylor sometimes found herself doubting whether she\u2019d made the right decision. In part, she blamed the Georgia law that forced her to leave the state for an abortion. The delay complicated a choice that once might have been simple, she said, leaving her to stew in ultrasound photos and antiabortion talking points.\u201cSometimes I just feel like I should have gone to my appointment,\u201d she said.After every trip to Target, Taylor deposited her new baby purchases in a pile in the middle of her living room. She wanted to make herself look at it: a growing reminder of everything that was coming.\u201cThis is the first adult thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d she said, taking stock of the pacifiers and baby cream.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to be a mom \u2026 But it\u2019s my responsibility now.\u201dThe stack of baby supplies grows as Taylor prepares for motherhood.
