It introduced one of the harshest abortion laws in Europe and was a payback to the church for brokering in 1989 the peaceful transition from socialism to capitalism but it also signified a symbolic reassertion of Polish catholic roots. \nFast forward to 2020, and this so-called \u2018compromise\u2019 appears to be anything but. Surveys show that most Poles support the liberalization of the abortion law, progressing secularization amongst younger generations is historically high and the authority of the clergy has declined as the church child sexual abuse scandals have come to light. Despite that, Law and Justice used the illegally appointed Constitutional Tribunal to bypass public debate over abortion and imposed an ideologically motivated interpretation of the law that will cause more harm and suffering. \nThe ruling of the\nConstitutional Tribunal infuriated hundreds of thousands of Poles who see it\nnot only as an inhumane act of the de-facto leader of the country, head of the\nruling party-Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski \u2013 but also as a deeply cynical move on his part\nto use the pandemic to pass a very unpopular law in order to appeal to his\npolitical rivals on the right. He clearly miscalculated, assuming that people would\nnot risk demonstrating in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. He seemed to have\nforgotten that only four years earlier thousands of Poles came out on the\nstreets in the Black Protests to oppose a legislation for a total ban on\nabortion.\nAnger\nin the streets \nThe scale of the current demonstrations can only be compared to the Solidarity protests from the 1980s. In five hundred demonstrations organized in major cities and small towns across the country, more than 800,000 people including former Law and Justice supporters have marched against not only the new reading of the law, but also against the current government. The clever (\u201cwe apologize for the delays, we have to overthrow the government\u201d), educational (\u201cmen of quality do not fear equality\u201d) and often vulgar (\u201cfuck Law and Justice\u201d) slogans of the protesters reflect the level of anger of unmatched proportions. Crowds have been shouting \u201cthis is war\u201d and \u201cyou have blood on your hands\u201d. \nProtesters have entered\nuncharted territory when they moved their dissent to the most politicized spaces\nin Poland, the churches. In Cracow, a few days ago, protesters gathered in\nfront of the bishop\u2019s palace holding letters that read \u2018the house of Satan\u201d to\noppose the role of the clergy in pushing for years for the curtailment of\nwomen\u2019s rights. Many rallying cries have singled out people responsible for\nthis this decision such as the head of Law and Justice and the Prime Minister.\nSome protesters even went as far as to locate the house of the president of the\nConstitutional Tribunal who ironically lives in one of the most progressive\nEuropean cities \u2013 Berlin and in a \u201cgesture of care for her neighbors\u201d: they\ndistributed leaflets detailing who she was- an illegally appointed judge who\nwatched over the stripping of nearly all of the remaining reproductive rights\nof Polish women. \nWomen\u2019s\nrevolt \nWhat can we make of these events? Protests in Poland seem to go far beyond the fight for reproductive rights of women. In a country that did not undergo the sexual revolution of 1968, in which the politicians gradually gave in to the church\u2019s pressure to entrench religious values into the legal system and consequently attempted to impose, albeit unsuccessfully, a traditional lifestyle onto a modernizing population, this moment was long overdue. The clergy and the politicians certainly designated the wrong group to be their sacrificial lamb and under-appreciated the wrath of Polish women. They seemed to have forgotten that half of the voters in Poland are women. And Polish women will not forget. \n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIga Mergler\n\n\r\n                                                                        Iga Mergler- is a PhD candidate at McMaster University in the Sociology Department, in her work she focuses on conspiracy theories, anti-genderism and the new media in Poland.                                                                    \n\n\nView all posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you like this article?
