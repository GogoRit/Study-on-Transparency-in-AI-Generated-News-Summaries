You can help change that.by Marie SolisJanuary 22, 2020, 11:00amShareTweetSnapFor decades, conservative politicians and activists have dictated the rhetoric around abortion, and for that reason many of the words we use to talk about the procedure are medically inaccurate, emotionally charged, and suffused with stigma. And that includes even the most basic terms we use to describe the debate over abortion rights: The anti-abortion camp has long described itself as \u201cpro-life\u201d instead, monopolizing a powerful word that advocates say clouds their real intention\u2014to ban abortion. The word \u201cchoice,\u201d some say, is an imprecise one as well, creating the impression that one\u2019s ability to get an abortion is simply a matter of choosing to do so, when in fact there are many systematic obstacles in the way that keep people from accessing the procedure.AdvertisementOther terms are not just imprecise, but flat out incorrect. \u201cLate-term abortion\u201d isn\u2019t a medical term, for example; and embryos don\u2019t have \u201cheartbeats\u201d at six weeks, despite the dozens of bills named for this supposed phenomenon.IdentityThe Way We Talk About Abortion Shapes How We Understand ItMarie Solis04.02.19This language has not only influenced how we talk about abortion on an everyday basis, but has shaped legislation and policy that affects people\u2019s access to the procedure, and, in some cases, prevented people from seeking the type of abortion care they would prefer to have. In a recent study on self-managed abortion, researchers found that some people chose to end their pregnancies on their own\u2014in private\u2014rather than get an abortion in a clinic \u201cto avoid the stigma or shame of having an abortion.\u201dMost people don\u2019t intend to harm people seeking abortions when they use medically incorrect terms; often it\u2019s the case that they simply lack crucial knowledge about the procedure that would help them talk about it in a more sensitive way. (A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that nearly 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t know how far along in pregnancy most abortions occur.)Reproductive health experts say that changing the way we talk about abortion can begin to change the realities of the people who need abortions.\u201cThe language that we use in this conversation defines the terms of the debate and defines whether people can access care in a supportive and affirming environment,\u201d said Elisabeth Smith, the chief counsel of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cWhen we use language that\u2019s stigmatizing, we are simply dividing people and creating additional hurdles or barriers for [patients].\u201dAdvertisementHere\u2019s how to begin undoing some of the stigma, according to providers, advocates, and people who have received abortion care themselves:Women aren\u2019t the only people who get abortions. \u201cPregnant people\u201d or \u201cpeople seeking abortions\u201d are less stigmatizing terms.Transgender and nonbinary people experience increased barriers to getting healthcare, and are more likely to face discrimination from providers when they can access it. And when it comes to abortion care, people can unwittingly exacerbate those barriers by implying that it\u2019s only cisgender women who need the procedure.\u201cIt\u2019s not only women who can get pregnant, which means it\u2019s not only women who seek access to care,\u201d Smith said. \u201cLeaving trans men or nonbinary people out of the conversation means that when they try to access care it\u2019s that much more stigmatizing and that much more difficult to access.\u201dInstead of \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d use \u201csix-week ban\u201d or simply \u201cabortion ban.\u201dWhat might otherwise be called a \u201csix-week\u201d abortion ban has instead become widely known as \u201cheartbeat\u201d legislation, thanks to conservative lawmakers who have used the false claim that six-week embryos have \u201cheartbeats\u201d in order to ban abortion before many people even know they\u2019re pregnant. (Even after a functioning heart does form, a fetus isn\u2019t considered viable until around 24 weeks.)\u201cThere\u2019s no heart [at that stage], there\u2019s only a collection of cardiac cells that pulse,\u201d Smith explained. That pulse\u2014which anti-abortion activists insist is the sound of a \u201cheartbeat\u201d\u2014isn\u2019t actually audible, Smith continued: \u201cThe sonogram machine is what makes the pulse,\u201d she said.AdvertisementInstead of \u201clate-term abortion,\u201d use \u201cabortion later in pregnancy\u201d or \"later abortion.\"Over the last year, President Donald Trump and other anti-choice politicians have leaned heavily on the term \u201clate-term abortion,\u201d using it to bolster the false claim that providers perform abortions just before patients' due dates. \u201cDemocrats are \u2026 pushing extreme late-term abortion,\u201d Trump said at a 2019 rally, after telling his supporters that fetuses can be \u201cripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth.\u201dNot only is this a misleading portrayal of the procedure, and a misrepresentation of the stage at which the overwhelming majority of abortions occur\u201488 percent are in the first trimester\u2014but the term itself is non-medical and inaccurate, according to experts.\"The term 'late-term abortion' was largely created by anti-choice individuals and groups as a way to create more emotion around the process of abortion and make people feel empathy for the fetus,\" Anuj Khattar, an abortion provider based in Washington and a fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health, told VICE last year. \"It's not a medical term used by the medical community.\u201dThis inflammatory language can mean that people who need later abortions (usually because of undetected fetal abnormalities or risks to their life) may find themselves experiencing stigma in already difficult circumstances.\"I kept telling my husband, 'Please don't think I'm a horrible person,\u2019\u201d said Dana Weinstein, a woman in Washington, D.C., who needed an abortion after she learned at 29 weeks that her fetus was missing large parts of its brain. \"Of course he didn't\u2014but it was so frustrating that I had this stigma in my face when I was in this devastating situation.\"AdvertisementAvoid claiming that a state has \u201cbanned abortion\u201d\u2014and don\u2019t share news stories that say so.In the first six months of 2019, seven states passed some version of an abortion ban: Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio passed legislation banning abortion at six weeks, while Missouri banned the procedure at eight weeks, and Alabama passed a near-total ban on abortion. All of these laws were\u2014and are\u2014unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade which says states can't restrict abortion before a fetus is viable outside the womb. None went into effect right away. Yet at the time, some news outlets ran headlines like \u201cAbortions after six weeks will be illegal under Georgia law,\u201d or failed to mention the inevitable legal challenges the laws would face until readers got several paragraphs in.Abortion providers have said that circulating this misinformation harms their patients by confusing them about the care they can legally access.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can make an appointment,\u2019\u201d Calla Hales, the director of a clinic network that oversees two locations in Georgia, told VICE last year amid the spate of bans. \u201cWe\u2019re explaining to them, \u2018No, abortion isn\u2019t illegal. This ban doesn\u2019t go into effect until 2020, and honestly, it may never get there.\u2019\u201dAdvocates say there\u2019s a way to emphasize the severity of abortion bans, without circulating information that can harm patients: Instead, people who want to share news about new anti-abortion legislation\u2014and those who are writing the news itself\u2014can use words like \u201ccould\u201d and \u201cwould\u201d instead of \u201cwill,\u201d to emphasize that the law is not yet in effect, and stress the law's unconstitutionality.AdvertisementInstead of \u201cchemical abortion,\u201d use \u201cmedication abortion\u201d or \u201cabortion with pills.\u201dMedication abortion is an early-abortion procedure that involves taking the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, which have been proven to be overwhelmingly safe and effective for ending a first-trimester pregnancy. When patients can access medication abortion in a clinic, they receive the medication from a licensed provider, and take the first drug in person and the second drug at home to pass the pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration continues to require patients to receive the medication in the provider's office as part of its longstanding restrictions on mifepristone, which much of the medical community has deemed unnecessary.But in an effort to portray the procedure as risky or illicit, abortion foes sometimes refer to medication abortion as \u201cchemical abortion\" instead.\u201cIt\u2019s a very deliberate choice on their part: People think of chemicals as causing harm, or something caustic,\u201d said Elisa Wells, the cofounder of Plan C, a site that rates online abortion-pill sellers for those who can\u2019t access medication abortion in a clinic.\u201cMedication is something approved and deemed to be safe,\u201d she said.Use \u201cself-managed\u201d to describe abortions people do themselves\u2014never \u201cback-alley\u201d abortion.Self-managed abortion in 2020 doesn\u2019t involve a coat hanger or receiving care from an unlicensed provider. It's the same method as medication abortion, except instead of getting the medications in a clinic, patients usually buy the pills online. And research has shown that the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol remain safe and effective even when administered without medical supervision.Some people choose self-managed abortion because they don\u2019t have access to in-clinic care, while others prefer it because of the privacy, comfort, and convenience it can offer. Either way, advocates say it shouldn\u2019t be characterized as dangerous or rudimentary so as to avoid stigmatizing the people who choose to self-manage.Advertisement\u201cWhen people use that term \u2018back-alley\u2019 it evokes a time when doing your own abortion could be very dangerous,\u201d Wells said.\u201cThat\u2019s not at all the case now with self-managed abortion,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe want to get away from the image of the coat hanger and help people associate self-managed abortion with pills and safety.\u201dAvoid the term \u201csurgical\u201d when referring to abortion\u2014say \"in-clinic\" or \"procedural\" abortion.Last week, New York City-based abortion provider Zoey Thill was explaining an early abortion procedure to a patient when she was faced with a revealing question: \u201cWhat do you cut with?\u201d Thill had shown the patient the tools she would use, but the patient was confused why there were no sharp instruments Thill could use to make an incision.As Thill went on to explain, performing an abortion doesn\u2019t involve any incisions or \u201ccutting\u201d of any kind. But she understands why some patients might think so: What Thill refers to as a \u201cprocedural abortion\u201d is what most people likely consider a \u201csurgical\u201d abortion. And the term \u201csurgical\u201d can give both patients and lawmakers a misleading idea about what an abortion entails, Thill said: In reality, most abortion procedures involve dilating the cervix, inserting a thin tube into the uterus, and then connecting it to a plastic, syringe-like device known as a vacuum aspirator to extract the pregnancy.\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple in-office procedure that sometimes can last just two or three minutes,\u201d she told VICE. But the term \u201csurgical\u201d can \u201celevate the perception of the severity of the procedure, which could make patients feel more anxious about it.\u201dReferring to abortion as surgery can also lend credence to regulations on providers and clinics, like the medically unnecessary and unconstitutional Louisiana law the Supreme Court will take up in March, requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges. \u201cRhetoric that associates abortion with danger can serve as their justification,\u201d Thill said.Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.Follow Marie Solis on Twitter.Tagged:roe v. wadeanti-abortion rhetoricheartbeat billself-managed abortionmedication abortionabortion later in pregnancyabortionlater abortionORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.0AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement\u00a9 2024 VICE MEDIA GROUP"
