The media reported that airport officials said they took action after \u201cmedical professionals expressed concern\u201d about the health of the mother and \u201crequested she be located.\u201d But such actions would demonstrate the opposite of respect for women\u2019s health and dignity.\nThe media reports say these women were given no information and did not have an opportunity to provide informed consent. Forced gynecological examinations can amount to sexual assault. Media also reported that authorities removed and examined additional women from the airport and other flights.\u00a0\nThe Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs said she is expecting a report from Qatari authorities sometime this week.\nThe reported invasion of these women\u2019s privacy is rightfully making headlines. But the circumstances that might have led a woman to leave the baby in the airport bathroom should be too.\nIn Qatar and across the Gulf region, sexual relations outside of wedlock are criminalized, meaning a pregnant woman who is not married, even if the pregnancy is the result of rape, may end up facing arrest and prosecution. Hospitals are required to report women pregnant outside of wedlock to the authorities. Abortion is also criminalized with limited exceptions including that women must have their husband\u2019s consent. Low-paid migrant women, like the more than 100,000 migrant domestic workers, in Qatar are disproportionately impacted by such policies.\nThe alleged actions of the Qatari authorities\u00a0 on October 2 would have failed many women \u2013 the unknown woman apparently forced to give birth in an airport toilet, unable to ask for assistance with her labor or on what to do with the baby, and the multiple women reportedly pulled off the plane for examinations.\nQatar should prohibit forced gynecological exams and investigate and bring to account any individuals who authorized any demeaning treatment. It should also decriminalize sex outside of wedlock. Authorities should ensure that pregnant people, regardless of their marital status, have access to quality sexual and reproductive health care and choices, including access to contraception, abortion, prenatal care, obstetric care, and adoption services without fearing arrest or prison.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAustralia Middle East/North Africa Qatar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSaudi Arabia to Host Women\u2019s Summit While Women Activists Sit Behind Bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nDomestic Violence Law Signals Hope for Kuwait\u2019s Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cMy Marriage was Mistake after Mistake\u201d\n\n\nThe Impact of Unregistered Marriages on Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Rights in Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nTrapped\n\n\nHow Male Guardianship Policies Restrict Women\u2019s Travel and Mobility in the Middle East and North Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSaudi Arabia to Host Women\u2019s Summit While Women Activists Sit Behind Bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nDomestic Violence Law Signals Hope for Kuwait\u2019s Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
