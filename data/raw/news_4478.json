This law would force providers to share this misinformation with patients at least 48 hours in advance of providing a medication abortion and again after the patient has started the abortion by taking the medication. Providers would also be required to post signs with large, bold print throughout their clinics informing patients about abortion \u201creversal.\u201d Providers who don\u2019t comply will face criminal prosecution for a felony, punishable by up to six years in prison, as well as a $10,000 fine per day. \nBy forcing doctors to lie to patients and share misinformation that isn\u2019t backed up by credible science, politicians are eroding the trust between patients and their providers. Plaintiffs filed suit in September 2020 and quickly secured a temporary restraining order blocking the law before it could go into effect in October 2020. In February 2021, plaintiffs secured a preliminary injunction blocking the law until the court issues its final ruling in the case. The case is ongoing, with a trial date set for May 2023.\nThe lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division. \n\n\n\n\nLegal Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n\nFeb 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee\u2019s Medically Unsound \u2018Abortion Reversal\u2019 Law Remains Blocked By Federal Courts\n\n\nTennessee\u2019s Medically Unsound \u2018Abortion Reversal\u2019 Law Remains Blocked By Federal Courts\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 30, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Court Temporarily Blocks Tennessee\u2019s Medically Unsound Medication Abortion \u201cReversal\u201d Law\n\n\nFederal Court Temporarily Blocks Tennessee\u2019s Medically Unsound Medication Abortion \u201cReversal\u201d Law\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 31, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee\u2019s Medically Unsound \u201cAbortion Reversal\u201d Law Challenged in Court\n\n\nTennessee\u2019s Medically Unsound \u201cAbortion Reversal\u201d Law Challenged in Court\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNews & Commentary\n\n\n\nA Tennessee Law Requires Doctors to Lie to Their Patients.
