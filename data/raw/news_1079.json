Wednesday, June 22, 2022, in hopes of convincing Republican lawmakers to repeal the state\u2019s 173-year-old ban on abortions. The ban has been dormant since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 but the court is expected to overturn that ruling any day. That would reactivate Wisconsin\u2019s ban. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called a special legislative session Wednesday afternoon to repeal the ban but Republicans control the Legislature and were expected to gavel in and gavel out without taking any action.

(AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 bid to repeal the battleground state\u2019s dormant abortion ban failed Wednesday after Republican lawmakers convened and immediately adjourned a special session without taking any action.Wisconsin adopted a ban on abortion except to save the mother\u2019s life in 1849, a year after the territory became a state. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide nullified the ban.The court is expected to rule this month in a case that could end Roe v. Wade, which would allow Wisconsin\u2019s ban to take effect. Lawmakers had to meet after Evers called the Legislature into special session this month, but they were not required to vote on the issue.Republicans blasted Evers\u2019 move as a political stunt designed to please the Democratic base as he faces reelection.\n\nSenate President Chris Kapenga gaveled in and out in 14 seconds just after noon. Democratic Sen. Tim Carpenter shouted \u201cObjection!\u201d to no avail. Kapenga walked off the floor without a word. Kapenga later issued a statement calling the special session \u201ca calculated campaign move\u201d and noting the Supreme Court hasn\u2019t yet issued it\u2019s decision.\nAbout 90 minutes after Kapenga\u2019s action, Assembly Republicans called their session to order and adjourned within 25 seconds. Evers has tried several times during his first term to force the Legislature into special sessions to take up popular Democratic bills, including gun control measures, Medicaid expansion and upgrading the state\u2019s unemployment benefits system. Every time Republicans gaveled in and out without any debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governor criticized Republicans for refusing to repeal the abortion ban. \u201c(Republicans) are helping to ensure our kids and grandkids grow up in a world where they have fewer rights than we did growing up \u2014 and that\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Evers said. \n\nAssembly Democratic Minority Leader Greta Neubauer and Senate Democratic Minority Leader Janet Bewley pledged to fight for new legislation.The two-year legislative session ended in March. The next regular session doesn\u2019t begin until January. Dozens of people gathered in the Capitol rotunda before Republican leaders took the floor to protest the looming Supreme Court decision and the GOP\u2019s plans. Many in the crowd were women.They wore pink T-shirts that read \u201cI Stand With Planned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cBans Off Our Bodies.\u201d They held signs that read \u201cThe GOP Wants To Party Like It\u2019s 1849\u201d and \u201cAbortion Is Health Care,\u201d and they shouted chants of \u201cNot the church, not the state, only we decide our fate!\u201dOfficials with the state Department of Administration, which oversees the Capitol police, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking an estimate on the number of protesters. A statewide Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday showed that 58% of respondents believe abortions should be legal in most or all cases, while 35% said it should be illegal. Those numbers have remained consistent for years and did not shift after the leak of the U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion that would undo Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe state ban will likely be challenged in court should Roe v. Wade be overturned.One major question is how the ban would interact with a related state law passed in 1985 that prohibits abortions after the fetus has reached viability but has an exemption for women whose health could be endangered by continuing the pregnancy. Abortion-rights groups have argued for a broad interpretation of that exemption to include emotional and mental health.Wisconsin Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has said he thinks the 1849 law is too old to enforce. He also has said he won\u2019t investigate or prosecute doctors who perform abortions if it takes effect.Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which operates three clinics that provide abortions in the state, has stopped scheduling procedures beyond June 25. Clinics in some other places also have halted scheduling.The special session came six weeks after the Madison office of the anti-abortion group Wisconsin Family Action was vandalized. Police have yet to arrest anyone.\n\nTim Michels, a Republican candidate for governor, this week called on Evers to put the Wisconsin National Guard on notice for similar acts and prepare for \u201cimpending acts of mass civil disobedience\u201d if Roe v. Wade is overturned.___Associated Press writers Scott Bauer and Harm Venhuizen contributed to this report.
