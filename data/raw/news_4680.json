Mike Dunleavy shakes the hands of state legislators as he prepares to deliver the 2023 State of the State address to the Alaska Legislature on Monday, Jan. 23, 2023, in Juneau, Alaska. At the close of the address, he said he wanted Alaska to be the most \"pro-life\" state in the country, without using the word \"abortion.\" (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy spent the last five minutes of his recent State of State address talking about becoming \u201cthe most pro-life state in the country,\u201d conspicuously never using the word \u201cabortion.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n \nListen to\u00a0Private Right, Episode 5: A \u2018pro-life state\u2019\n\n\t\u201cThrough the actions we\u2019ll take together, when people ask which of the 50 states values children and families the most, from the moment of conception on, I hope they say Alaska,\u201d he said.\nHe and many other Alaska politicians have been trying to chip away at Alaska\u2019s constitutionally protected right to access an abortion. Some efforts have lasted decades. Despite this, abortion in Alaska remains legal and there are efforts currently underway that could mean even greater access to reproductive health care.\u00a0\n\u201cWe stand on a precipice of the potential to greatly expand not only abortion access but health care access in this state,\u201d said Rose O\u2019Hara Jolley, Alaska state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.\nA constitutional amendment from Dunleavy?\nDunleavy was elected in 2018 after saying he opposed abortion, including in cases of rape or incest. More recently, he\u2019s emphasized that being a \u201cpro-life state\u201d means changing policy and taking action to increase Alaska\u2019s population.\u00a0\n\u201cWe need more people in Alaska, not less. We need more people in our jobs. We need more people in our schools. We need more people who create wealth,\u201d Dunleavy said during his Jan. 23 State of the State address. \u201cWe need more families achieving the American dream.\u201d\nHe mentioned his Healthy Families Initiative, which includes a bill to extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers from 60 days to one year.\u00a0\n\u201cI know this may sound strange to some, but we have to make it OK. We have to make it OK again to have families, to put a family together and to have children,\u201d he said. \u201cKids are a blessing and they shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a burden.\u201d\nAbout a week later, Dunleavy was a guest on Alaska Public Media\u2019s Talk of Alaska, hosted by Lori Townsend. Clarification about what he meant by \u201cpro-life state\u201d came up.\u00a0\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t mention abortion in my State of the State speech. It was about being the most pro-life state; interconnected issues at some levels, but also not at others,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nTownsend replied: \u201cWell, when you say pro-life, people automatically assume that you\u2019re talking about access to abortion.\u201d\n\u201cRight, and what I laid out was a place that\u2019s inviting for family, supportive of families,\u201d Dunleavy said.\nHe again brought up expanding Medicaid for postpartum mothers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pro-life if you make Alaska a more inviting place for people to come and want to have families, whether that\u2019s better schools, whether that\u2019s cheaper housing, cheaper fuel,\u201d Dunleavy said.\u00a0\nTownsend sought clarification: \u201cSo you\u2019re not talking about \u2026 trying to repeal or amend the right to privacy here?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in the state of Alaska that doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pro-life, that if (the right to an abortion) in Alaska was repealed, I think that would be a good thing. The question is, how does that happen? It only happens through a constitutional amendment. And if this Legislature is not interested in passing a constitutional amendment, it makes it difficult,\u201d Dunleavy replied.\u00a0\nDunleavy hasn\u2019t yet proposed any legislation this year that could lead to restrictions on abortion rights. But, last June, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the federal constitutional right to abortion, he said he\u2019d take action.\u00a0\nIn a press release, Dunleavy said the court presented \u201can opportunity for the people of Alaska, not a handful of elected officials or appointed judges, to decide the future of abortion in Alaska.\u201d\nHe said he would propose a constitutional amendment on whether abortion should be a protected right. Back then though, it wasn\u2019t known if Dunleavy would remain governor. It was the middle of the summer and the election was still months away.\u00a0\nDunleavy ended up winning. So did more than enough legislators who block a constitutional amendment on abortion. What didn\u2019t win? A constitutional convention.\nVoters handily rejected holding a constitutional convention, which was championed by conservatives. A convention could have challenged Alaska\u2019s abortion rights.\u00a0\nA few weeks after the election, before his holiday open house, Dunleavy spoke again about the resolution in response to a question.\n\u201cBasically what it would do is allow the people themselves to decide if abortion would be legal in all cases, if abortion would be limited in certain cases,\u201d he said.\nBut Dunleavy wasn\u2019t sure at that point if he would introduce it during this legislative session:\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re discussing that. Given the nature of the Legislature, we don\u2019t know where that will go,\u201d he said.\nBy February, his office still didn\u2019t give a definitive answer.\nThe ups and downs of the parental consent bill\nFor the past few decades, Alaska lawmakers have focused on restricting abortion through state law, not the state constitution. They\u2019ve introduced several bills almost every session to weaken Alaska\u2019s right to access an abortion. A couple have resulted in Alaska Supreme Court cases. The details of the cases show why it\u2019s been so hard to restrict this right.\nIn 1997, the Legislature debated a bill requiring minors to get permission, or consent, from a parent, guardian or court before they could receive an abortion. The journey of the parental consent bill would last close to two decades, and was a rollercoaster.\u00a0\nSpeaking on the Senate floor, bill sponsor then-Sen. Loren Leman, R-Anchorage, said the bill was \u201ca small step toward making abortion less plentiful.\u201d\n\u201cIf we can encourage children to communicate with parents, I believe that will help reduce the number of abortions and certainly will help children make more intelligent decisions,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHe said there was \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the issue of parental involvement.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not an abstraction. There are very real cases where parents have not been notified that their daughters are having an abortion. In fact, in some cases, the daughters were encouraged by school counselors, perhaps friends and others to get an abortion and not notify their parents,\u201d Leman said.\nThese situations, he said, present health risks.\u00a0\nThen-Sen. Johnny Ellis, D-Anchorage, said delaying care, which the bill would do, could threaten the health and life of the person seeking an abortion. Ultimately, he said, the bill infringes on a person\u2019s constitutional right to have an abortion. A yes vote on the bill is \u201canti-choice,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cWith all due respect to those who have pushed this bill diligently over the years, I believe their ultimate goal is to chip away at the right to choose and to force others to adhere to their sense of morality. The ultimate objective is to make abortion illegal in our state and that should concern anyone who values their constitutional rights and their freedom,\u201d Ellis said.\nThe bill passed in the Senate and House. But Tony Knowles, the governor at the time, vetoed it. He called the bill a \u201cnew restriction on the constitutional protections afforded all Alaskans,\u201d and said it was \u201cconstitutionally vague and unnecessary.\u201d\nHe also got personal in this veto letter: \u201cIt would break my heart if my teenage daughter found herself in similar circumstances and felt she could not come to me or her mother for our counsel. But I would far rather she go to a family friend or relation than be forced to go to a court and deal with strangers. This bill does not allow that to happen.\u201d\nThe Legislature overrode the governor\u2019s veto. So the bill ended up in the courts, and, a decade later, the state Supreme Court struck down the parental consent bill, saying it violated minors\u2019 fundamental right to privacy under the Alaska Constitution.\nThe fight for parental consent doesn\u2019t end there though. For two legislative sessions in a row,, Coghill introduced similar legislation, which failed to pass.\u00a0\nBut in 2010, citizens initiated a ballot measure that would require doctors to notify parents when a minor was seeking an abortion, and penalize doctors who did not receive parents\u2019 consent. It passed and became law, with 56% voting yes\nThen in July 2016, the Alaska Supreme Court overturned the state\u2019s parental notification law.\u00a0\nAgain, Alaska Supreme Court judges said a law violated the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy \u2013 as well as its equal protection clause.\nFailed attempts to stop state funding of abortions\nThere was another major legislative fight over abortion. This one has been over state funding.\nIn the late 1990s, the state government stopped funding abortions for low-income residents.\u00a0\nIn 2001, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that Alaska was violating the equal protection clause, and the state must fund these abortions. It found that if the state chooses to fund other medically necessary care related to pregnancy under Medicare, it must also cover medically necessary abortions.\u00a0\nMore than a decade later, in 2013, lawmakers \u2013 including then-Sen. Mike Dunleavy \u2013 sought to define \u201cmedically necessary\u201d in an effort to limit state funding for what they considered elective abortions.\u00a0\nThe bill narrowed the definition to cover only cases of rape or incest, or if the abortion prevented \u201cserious risk to the life or physical health\u201d of a pregnant person. It listed physical conditions, like seizures, kidney infection and congestive heart failure, but did not include any mental health conditions.\nThe debate over the bill was intense. Arguments made on the Senate and House floors for limiting Medicaid funding for abortions covered a range of issues.\nCoghill, who had become a senator, was the bill sponsor., He said the bill \u201cpivots only on one question: Who pays for medically necessary (abortions) and who pays for elective?\u201d\nHe later added:\n\u201cOne member on the body here reports that that should be between the doctor and woman. I agree. But when you\u2019re asking other people to pay for it, you\u2019re asking them to be included in that decision too, and so if it\u2019s purely elective, that should be between the doctor and a woman, between the person and their checkbook. If it\u2019s truly medically necessary, we as a people, we want to step up and say we\u2019re here to help,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nPete Kelly, also a Republican in the Senate from the Fairbanks area, wanted the Legislature to stand up for itself: \u201cWe seem to have just handed so much over to the court. They are not our masters. We make the laws and we should defend our branch of government.\u201d\nGabrielle LeDoux, a Republican representative from Anchorage, said the bill didn\u2019t limit a person\u2019s right to choose.\n\u201cEqual protection does not mean that the government pays. We\u2019ve got the right to travel, but that doesn\u2019t mean the government buys us a ticket to Paris. We\u2019ve got a right to bear arms but the government doesn\u2019t buy us a Sturm, Ruger,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA variety of arguments were also made against the bill in 2014.\nHarriet Drummond, a Democrat representing parts of Anchorage in the House, said she\u2019d often heard lawmakers talk about government overreach. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a poor woman, or a health care provider, this is the worst kind of interference one can imagine. I\u2019ve listened to this body complain about regulation and interference with everything from gold miners to traffic signals. But when it comes to women\u2019s bodies and their health, I suppose regulation and interference by this Legislature is just fine,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nSen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a constitutional issue here. \u2026 You can\u2019t pass laws to change the constitution, and that is what we\u2019re trying to do here.\u201d\nHollis French, also an Anchorage Democratic senator, said the court had already decided the issue in 2001.\n\u201cIf a Medicaid-eligible woman is pregnant, and the state elects to provide some aid to her like (an) ultrasound, or well mom visits or the coverage of delivery costs, it cannot then turn around and restrict her reproductive freedom rights for other aspects of her pregnancy that may be medically necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court\u2019s opinion in 2001 was unanimous. It is not a close legal call. The selective denial of medical benefits violates Alaska\u2019s constitutional guarantee of equal protection. This bill will be struck down.\u201d\nThen-Rep. Geran Tarr, D-Anchorage, said she was uncomfortable with the statement that the Legislature would make if this bill passes, \u201cthat it\u2019s OK to treat poor women differently than other women.\n\u201cAll women in Alaska deserve equal protection under the law. All women in Alaska should have access to this right. That is the right to reproductive freedom to make choices in the privacy of that doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Tarr said.\u00a0\nThe bill defining a \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortion passed in 2014.\u00a0\nFive years later, the Alaska Supreme Court struck it down, saying it violated the state constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection. A lower court, years earlier, had already barred the measure from being enforced.\u00a0\nWithin those five years that it took the state Supreme Court to make that decision, Dunleavy went from being a state senator to being the governor.\u00a0\nAnd in 2019, he tried to take action on his own. To show his dislike for the courts\u2019 decisions surrounding medicaid funding for abortion, he vetoed about $335,000 from the courts\u2019 budget. He said that was the amount the state spent on elective abortions the year prior.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Legislative and Executive Branch are opposed to State funded elective abortions,\u201d a budget document said, \u201cthe only branch of government that insists on State funded elected abortions is the Supreme Court.\u201d\nThis veto was partially what led a group to form to recall Gov. Dunleavy. An Alaska court eventually ruled his veto as being unconstitutional.\u00a0\nDespite the Alaska Supreme Court upholding the right to abortion over and over again, the Alaska House has repeatedly voted to amend the budget to eliminate state funding for abortion.\nThen-Rep. Chris Kurka, R-Wasilla, proposed the amendment in 2022.\n\u201cIt also cuts $350,000 from the Medicaid budget, which is a very, very small estimate of how much the state of Alaska pays every year to kill kids in the womb,\u201d he said on the House floor.\nThe House amendment that passed on the floor didn\u2019t make it into the final budget. The language from the Senate was more symbolic, didn\u2019t make any actual change to state practice and avoided the possibility of yet another court case.\u00a0\nFor decades, Alaska has elected several governors and legislative majorities \u2013 and even passed a ballot measure \u2013 that have tried to restrict abortion rights. And the Alaska courts\u2019 interpretation of the state constitution have stood in their way.\nPlanned Parenthood v. State of Alaska (again)\nThe state is in a legal battle over abortion right now, and the case has already resulted in greater access to abortion for Alaskans.\u00a0\nAt the end of 2019, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging an Alaska law that says abortions can only be performed by a physician. It was also challenging a regulation indicating that medication abortion cannot be administered by nurse practitioners or physician assistants.\nBefore the lawsuit, that meant, for abortions that occur through the use of medication, \u201ca clinician or physician needed to meet with the patient in person and prescribe and hand that medication to the patient,\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\nO\u2019Hara-Jolley said the requirement to have a physician not only prescribe but hand out themedication was an unnecessary burden, especially for people who have to travel to one of only three Planned Parenthood health clinics, in Anchorage, Fairbanks or Juneau.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood is the main health care provider in Alaska that offers abortions, and physicians may only be available one day a week at each clinic, whereas advanced nurse practitioners are more readily available. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants are licensed health care providers with advanced education and training, and Planned Parenthood argued, are qualified to hand out the medication required for a medication abortion.\u00a0\nIn Nov. 2021, a Superior Court judge agreed and granted Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. That means, while the rest of the court case plays out, who can hand out the medicine for medication abortion has expanded beyond just physicians.\u00a0\n\u201cNow we can do telehealth appointments from our health care centers, where you can telehealth with a clinician, they can prescribe it to you and an advanced nurse practitioner can hand it to you,\u201d O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\u00a0\nIn granting the preliminary injunction, the court said Planned Parenthood was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim. Planned Parenthood argued that prohibiting advanced practice clinicians, like nurse practitioners, from providing medication abortions violates patients\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy and equal protection.\u00a0\nThe court said medication abortion has a low risk of complications. And the state was unable to justify to the court why advanced practice clinicians couldn\u2019t administer medication abortions when they use the same type of medication to treat patients experiencing miscarriages.\u00a0\nAt the moment, people still have to physically go to Planned Parenthood, but the wait time to have a physician hand you the medication is now gone.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowing for more appointments and more availability, especially with something like medication abortion where time is of the essence and does matter. It\u2019s allowing for the expansion of access to that care across the state,\u201d O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\u00a0\nMedication abortions can be done up until about 10 or 11 weeks of pregnancy.\nCurrently, the case is scheduled to be heard in March.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood officials have said that ideally, in the future, the organization could expand the service by partnering with other advanced nurse practitioners to eliminate the need for people to have to travel to a Planned Parenthood clinic.\n\u201cI am optimistic in the future about us being able to continue to expand access to this care, but this is a first expansion and so moving in the right direction,\u201d O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\u00a0\nThe current Legislature\nIn the new Legislature, so far there\u2019s been only one resolution introduced to challenge Alaska\u2019s right to an abortion. Shelly Hughes\u2019 Senate Joint Resolution proposes amending the state constitution to add this:\n\u201cTo protect human life, nothing in this constitution may be construed to secure or protect a right to an abortion or require the State to fund an abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nThis resolution is the same legislation Hughes has sponsored before, most recently in 2021. That year, it was one of several measures regarding abortion.\u00a0\nIn Alaska, despite Roe v. Wade being overturned, any effort to restrict abortion rights faces obstacles. The state Senate majority has said they likely won\u2019t take up abortion bills. The Alaska courts have a consistent record of upholding abortion as a right. And even Dunleavy, a newly reelected governor who describes himself as pro-life, hasn\u2019t proposed abortion restrictions this year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWhile governor aims for a \u2018pro-life state,\u2019 abortion rights appear entrenched in Alaska\nby Lisa Phu, Alaska Beacon February 15, 2023\nWhile governor aims for a \u2018pro-life state,\u2019 abortion rights appear entrenched in Alaska\nby Lisa Phu, Alaska Beacon February 15, 2023\n Alaska Gov.

Given the nature of the Legislature, we don\u2019t know where that will go,\u201d he said.\nBy February, his office still didn\u2019t give a definitive answer.\n    The ups and downs of the parental consent bill\n\n\t\nFor the past few decades, Alaska lawmakers have focused on restricting abortion through state law, not the state constitution. They\u2019ve introduced several bills almost every session to weaken Alaska\u2019s right to access an abortion. A couple have resulted in Alaska Supreme Court cases. The details of the cases show why it\u2019s been so hard to restrict this right.\nIn 1997, the Legislature debated a bill requiring minors to get permission, or consent, from a parent, guardian or court before they could receive an abortion. The journey of the parental consent bill would last close to two decades, and was a rollercoaster.\u00a0\nSpeaking on the Senate floor, bill sponsor then-Sen. Loren Leman, R-Anchorage, said the bill was \u201ca small step toward making abortion less plentiful.\u201d\n\u201cIf we can encourage children to communicate with parents, I believe that will help reduce the number of abortions and certainly will help children make more intelligent decisions,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHe said there was \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the issue of parental involvement.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not an abstraction. There are very real cases where parents have not been notified that their daughters are having an abortion. In fact, in some cases, the daughters were encouraged by school counselors, perhaps friends and others to get an abortion and not notify their parents,\u201d Leman said.\nThese situations, he said, present health risks.\u00a0\nThen-Sen. Johnny Ellis, D-Anchorage, said delaying care, which the bill would do, could threaten the health and life of the person seeking an abortion. Ultimately, he said, the bill infringes on a person\u2019s constitutional right to have an abortion. A yes vote on the bill is \u201canti-choice,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cWith all due respect to those who have pushed this bill diligently over the years, I believe their ultimate goal is to chip away at the right to choose and to force others to adhere to their sense of morality. The ultimate objective is to make abortion illegal in our state and that should concern anyone who values their constitutional rights and their freedom,\u201d Ellis said.\nThe bill passed in the Senate and House. But Tony Knowles, the governor at the time, vetoed it. He called the bill a \u201cnew restriction on the constitutional protections afforded all Alaskans,\u201d and said it was \u201cconstitutionally vague and unnecessary.\u201d\nHe also got personal in this veto letter: \u201cIt would break my heart if my teenage daughter found herself in similar circumstances and felt she could not come to me or her mother for our counsel. But I would far rather she go to a family friend or relation than be forced to go to a court and deal with strangers. This bill does not allow that to happen.\u201d\nThe Legislature overrode the governor\u2019s veto. So the bill ended up in the courts, and, a decade later, the state Supreme Court struck down the parental consent bill, saying it violated minors\u2019 fundamental right to privacy under the Alaska Constitution.\nThe fight for parental consent doesn\u2019t end there though. For two legislative sessions in a row,, Coghill introduced similar legislation, which failed to pass.\u00a0\nBut in 2010, citizens initiated a ballot measure that would require doctors to notify parents when a minor was seeking an abortion, and penalize doctors who did not receive parents\u2019 consent. It passed and became law, with 56% voting yes\nThen in July 2016, the Alaska Supreme Court overturned the state\u2019s parental notification law.\u00a0\nAgain, Alaska Supreme Court judges said a law violated the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy \u2013 as well as its equal protection clause.\n    Failed attempts to stop state funding of abortions\n\n\t\nThere was another major legislative fight over abortion. This one has been over state funding.\nIn the late 1990s, the state government stopped funding abortions for low-income residents.\u00a0\nIn 2001, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that Alaska was violating the equal protection clause, and the state must fund these abortions. It found that if the state chooses to fund other medically necessary care related to pregnancy under Medicare, it must also cover medically necessary abortions.\u00a0\nMore than a decade later, in 2013, lawmakers \u2013 including then-Sen. Mike Dunleavy \u2013 sought to define \u201cmedically necessary\u201d in an effort to limit state funding for what they considered elective abortions.\u00a0\nThe bill narrowed the definition to cover only cases of rape or incest, or if the abortion prevented \u201cserious risk to the life or physical health\u201d of a pregnant person. It listed physical conditions, like seizures, kidney infection and congestive heart failure, but did not include any mental health conditions.\nThe debate over the bill was intense. Arguments made on the Senate and House floors for limiting Medicaid funding for abortions covered a range of issues.\nCoghill, who had become a senator, was the bill sponsor., He said the bill \u201cpivots only on one question: Who pays for medically necessary (abortions) and who pays for elective?\u201d\nHe later added:\n\u201cOne member on the body here reports that that should be between the doctor and woman. I agree. But when you\u2019re asking other people to pay for it, you\u2019re asking them to be included in that decision too, and so if it\u2019s purely elective, that should be between the doctor and a woman, between the person and their checkbook. If it\u2019s truly medically necessary, we as a people, we want to step up and say we\u2019re here to help,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nPete Kelly, also a Republican in the Senate from the Fairbanks area, wanted the Legislature to stand up for itself: \u201cWe seem to have just handed so much over to the court. They are not our masters. We make the laws and we should defend our branch of government.\u201d\nGabrielle LeDoux, a Republican representative from Anchorage, said the bill didn\u2019t limit a person\u2019s right to choose.\n\u201cEqual protection does not mean that the government pays. We\u2019ve got the right to travel, but that doesn\u2019t mean the government buys us a ticket to Paris. We\u2019ve got a right to bear arms but the government doesn\u2019t buy us a Sturm, Ruger,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA variety of arguments were also made against the bill in 2014.\nHarriet Drummond, a Democrat representing parts of Anchorage in the House, said she\u2019d often heard lawmakers talk about government overreach. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a poor woman, or a health care provider, this is the worst kind of interference one can imagine. I\u2019ve listened to this body complain about regulation and interference with everything from gold miners to traffic signals. But when it comes to women\u2019s bodies and their health, I suppose regulation and interference by this Legislature is just fine,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nSen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a constitutional issue here. \u2026 You can\u2019t pass laws to change the constitution, and that is what we\u2019re trying to do here.\u201d\nHollis French, also an Anchorage Democratic senator, said the court had already decided the issue in 2001.\n\u201cIf a Medicaid-eligible woman is pregnant, and the state elects to provide some aid to her like (an) ultrasound, or well mom visits or the coverage of delivery costs, it cannot then turn around and restrict her reproductive freedom rights for other aspects of her pregnancy that may be medically necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court\u2019s opinion in 2001 was unanimous. It is not a close legal call. The selective denial of medical benefits violates Alaska\u2019s constitutional guarantee of equal protection. This bill will be struck down.\u201d\nThen-Rep. Geran Tarr, D-Anchorage, said she was uncomfortable with the statement that the Legislature would make if this bill passes, \u201cthat it\u2019s OK to treat poor women differently than other women.\n\u201cAll women in Alaska deserve equal protection under the law. All women in Alaska should have access to this right. That is the right to reproductive freedom to make choices in the privacy of that doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Tarr said.\u00a0\nThe bill defining a \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortion passed in 2014.\u00a0\nFive years later, the Alaska Supreme Court struck it down, saying it violated the state constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection. A lower court, years earlier, had already barred the measure from being enforced.\u00a0\nWithin those five years that it took the state Supreme Court to make that decision, Dunleavy went from being a state senator to being the governor.\u00a0\nAnd in 2019, he tried to take action on his own. To show his dislike for the courts\u2019 decisions surrounding medicaid funding for abortion, he vetoed about $335,000 from the courts\u2019 budget. He said that was the amount the state spent on elective abortions the year prior.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Legislative and Executive Branch are opposed to State funded elective abortions,\u201d a budget document said, \u201cthe only branch of government that insists on State funded elected abortions is the Supreme Court.\u201d\nThis veto was partially what led a group to form to recall Gov. Dunleavy. An Alaska court eventually ruled his veto as being unconstitutional.\u00a0\nDespite the Alaska Supreme Court upholding the right to abortion over and over again, the Alaska House has repeatedly voted to amend the budget to eliminate state funding for abortion.\nThen-Rep. Chris Kurka, R-Wasilla, proposed the amendment in 2022.\n\u201cIt also cuts $350,000 from the Medicaid budget, which is a very, very small estimate of how much the state of Alaska pays every year to kill kids in the womb,\u201d he said on the House floor.\nThe House amendment that passed on the floor didn\u2019t make it into the final budget. The language from the Senate was more symbolic, didn\u2019t make any actual change to state practice and avoided the possibility of yet another court case.\u00a0\nFor decades, Alaska has elected several governors and legislative majorities \u2013 and even passed a ballot measure \u2013 that have tried to restrict abortion rights. And the Alaska courts\u2019 interpretation of the state constitution have stood in their way.\n    Planned Parenthood v. State of Alaska (again)\n\n\t\nThe state is in a legal battle over abortion right now, and the case has already resulted in greater access to abortion for Alaskans.\u00a0\nAt the end of 2019, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging an Alaska law that says abortions can only be performed by a physician. It was also challenging a regulation indicating that medication abortion cannot be administered by nurse practitioners or physician assistants.\nBefore the lawsuit, that meant, for abortions that occur through the use of medication, \u201ca clinician or physician needed to meet with the patient in person and prescribe and hand that medication to the patient,\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\nO\u2019Hara-Jolley said the requirement to have a physician not only prescribe but hand out themedication was an unnecessary burden, especially for people who have to travel to one of only three Planned Parenthood health clinics, in Anchorage, Fairbanks or Juneau.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood is the main health care provider in Alaska that offers abortions, and physicians may only be available one day a week at each clinic, whereas advanced nurse practitioners are more readily available. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants are licensed health care providers with advanced education and training, and Planned Parenthood argued, are qualified to hand out the medication required for a medication abortion.\u00a0\nIn Nov. 2021, a Superior Court judge agreed and granted Planned Parenthood\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. That means, while the rest of the court case plays out, who can hand out the medicine for medication abortion has expanded beyond just physicians.\u00a0\n\u201cNow we can do telehealth appointments from our health care centers, where you can telehealth with a clinician, they can prescribe it to you and an advanced nurse practitioner can hand it to you,\u201d O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\u00a0\nIn granting the preliminary injunction, the court said Planned Parenthood was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim. Planned Parenthood argued that prohibiting advanced practice clinicians, like nurse practitioners, from providing medication abortions violates patients\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy and equal protection.\u00a0\nThe court said medication abortion has a low risk of complications. And the state was unable to justify to the court why advanced practice clinicians couldn\u2019t administer medication abortions when they use the same type of medication to treat patients experiencing miscarriages.\u00a0\nAt the moment, people still have to physically go to Planned Parenthood, but the wait time to have a physician hand you the medication is now gone.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowing for more appointments and more availability, especially with something like medication abortion where time is of the essence and does matter. It\u2019s allowing for the expansion of access to that care across the state,\u201d O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\u00a0\nMedication abortions can be done up until about 10 or 11 weeks of pregnancy.\nCurrently, the case is scheduled to be heard in March.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood officials have said that ideally, in the future, the organization could expand the service by partnering with other advanced nurse practitioners to eliminate the need for people to have to travel to a Planned Parenthood clinic.\n\u201cI am optimistic in the future about us being able to continue to expand access to this care, but this is a first expansion and so moving in the right direction,\u201d O\u2019Hara-Jolley said.\u00a0\n    The current Legislature\n\n\t\nIn the new Legislature, so far there\u2019s been only one resolution introduced to challenge Alaska\u2019s right to an abortion. Shelly Hughes\u2019 Senate Joint Resolution proposes amending the state constitution to add this:\n\u201cTo protect human life, nothing in this constitution may be construed to secure or protect a right to an abortion or require the State to fund an abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nThis resolution is the same legislation Hughes has sponsored before, most recently in 2021. That year, it was one of several measures regarding abortion.\u00a0\nIn Alaska, despite Roe v. Wade being overturned, any effort to restrict abortion rights faces obstacles. The state Senate majority has said they likely won\u2019t take up abortion bills. The Alaska courts have a consistent record of upholding abortion as a right. And even Dunleavy, a newly reelected governor who describes himself as pro-life, hasn\u2019t proposed abortion restrictions this year.\u00a0\n    \n    \n        \n\t\t\t\n            GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n        \n        \n            SUBSCRIBE\n        \n    \n    \n\t\n\n\n Alaska Beacon is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
