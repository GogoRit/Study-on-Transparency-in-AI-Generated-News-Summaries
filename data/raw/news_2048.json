(AP) \u2014 The complexities of abortion-related politics in the post-Roe v. Wade era continue to put the squeeze on Republican Daniel Cameron, who appeared to redefine his position on Kentucky\u2019s strict anti-abortion law for the second time in two weeks while campaigning for governor.After revealing last week that he would sign legislation adding rape and incest exceptions to the state\u2019s abortion ban, Cameron seemed to take a more hardline stance Wednesday. He did so while trying to reassure someone who claimed to be concerned that he was weakening his anti-abortion position. Cameron indicated that he would support such exceptions \u201cif the courts made us change that law.\u201d\u201cMy point was that ... we are in a fight with the courts right now,\u201d Cameron said in an audio recording of the conversation during a campaign stop in London, Kentucky. \u201cAnd so if the courts were to strike down and say that we needed to add (exceptions), of course I would sign that because I still want to protect life. But that would just be based on if our courts made that change; it wouldn\u2019t be me, proactively.\u201d\n\nDemocrats pounced on the comments, saying it reinforced Cameron\u2019s longtime support for the sweeping abortion ban. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s campaign has run TV ads linking Cameron to the ban and pointing to its consequences for young victims of rape or incest forced to carry their pregnancies to term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reason he twists himself into knots on answers like this is because he knows the vast majority of Kentuckians find his view cruel and dangerous,\u201d Beshear campaign spokesman Alex Floyd said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the audio recording surfaced Wednesday, Cameron\u2019s campaign reiterated that he supports the existing abortion law while adding that if the legislature sent him a bill with exceptions, he would sign it. The campaign didn\u2019t push back on the authenticity of the recording.\n\nBeshear has gone on offense on an issue that anti-abortion Republicans long claimed as theirs in this largely conservative state. The Beshear-Cameron showdown is one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched elections in 2023, a year before the nation decides control of the White House and Congress. Cameron is the state\u2019s attorney general while Beshear is seeking a second term as governor in the GOP-leaning state.Cameron\u2019s comments Wednesday came after the unidentified person expressed concern that he had \u201cwavered a little bit on protections for life.\u201d Cameron replied that he supports the current law, which bans all abortions except when carried out to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life or to prevent a disabling injury. During a GOP primary debate in March, Cameron expressed support for the abortion law as written. And as attorney general, his office has defended the near-total abortion ban in court. Cameron\u2019s comments at the campaign event Wednesday seemed to satisfy the person who raised the issue, based on the recording. How it plays out statewide is another question.As the campaign heads into its final weeks, Cameron has appeared to try to mollify both abortion hardliners and moderate voters who support exceptions to the abortion law. It\u2019s an indication that Cameron and his team are having \u201csome difficulty figuring out what they want to do with this issue\u201d in the broader general election campaign, Kentucky political commentator Al Cross said Thursday.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d Cross said. \u201cThey want to know where a candidate stands. And most people favor rape and incest exceptions.\u201dLast year, Kentucky voters defeated a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters in several states have protected abortion rights via ballot measures.A lingering question has been whether Cameron would push the GOP-dominated legislature to create abortion exceptions. With his comments Wednesday, \u201che\u2019s making clear that he\u2019s not,\u201d Cross said.Beshear has called the state\u2019s abortion ban an extremist law that he says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Kentuckians disagree with, pointing to the lack of exceptions for rape and incest. \n\nAmid the fallout from the Wednesday recording, Cameron\u2019s campaign tried to shift the focus to Beshear\u2019s stance as an abortion-rights supporter, saying: \u201cVoters should be given more clarity on what week Andy Beshear would protect the unborn?\u201dBeshear\u2019s campaign responded Thursday that the governor \u201chas always supported reasonable restrictions, especially on late-term procedures.\u201dLast year, Beshear vetoed a bill that included a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Beshear noted at the time that the measure lacked exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. His veto was overridden by lawmakers. Once Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, the state\u2019s so-called trigger law \u2014 passed in 2019 \u2014 took effect to ban nearly all abortions in Kentucky.\n\nA bill to allow rape and incest exceptions made no headway in Kentucky\u2019s legislature this year. The ongoing debate points to Cameron\u2019s political challenges amid the new dynamics of abortion policymaking.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to meet the litmus test of being pro-life enough to win the kind of endorsements that you need to win as a Republican primary candidate, and then having a position that is palatable enough to a greater swath of the electorate,\u201d GOP political consultant T.J. Litafik said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
