We want to hear from you, our readers, about what we should be reporting and how we can serve you.\u00a0Get in touch here.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 The kids were sleeping and it was still dark when Rocky left her house in Stockbridge, Georgia. It was 4:30 a.m., but she knew she and her fianc\u00e9 had to leave early to make it to the clinic, which was a four-and-a-half hour drive \u2014 maybe a little less if they could beat traffic.\u00a0\u00a0\nRocky thought she\u2019d caught her pregnancy early enough.\u00a0A 31-year-old paralegal, she\u2019d tested only a few days after missing her period and took two days to think about what to do. She realized that her family couldn\u2019t afford another child \u2014 she already had three kids, ages 3, 10 and 11.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago, Rocky, who asked to be referred to by a pseudonym because of the stigma surrounding her decision, had gotten another abortion at a clinic 20 minutes from her house. On a Friday morning in mid-June, she walked into the Georgia clinic again. The building, so crowded with patients last time, was conspicuously empty.\nRocky learned at the clinic that she was about six weeks and two days pregnant, too late for Georgia, which, as of last July, had banned abortions past six weeks. From Stockbridge, a city just outside of Atlanta, she only had two close options: She could drive about five hours south to Jacksonville, Florida, or she could trek north to Charlotte. The Charlotte clinic had an opening in a week; by the time she got her abortion, she would be just past seven weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Previous Coverage:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Coverage:\n\n                        Republicans in North Carolina override veto of 12-week abortion ban\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nSo this was the plan when she set off in the wee hours of the morning with her fianc\u00e9: She\u2019d get her abortion pills in Charlotte, grab some lunch and drive back. Her cousin could watch the kids while they were gone.\u00a0\nIn a few weeks, on July 1, North Carolina was set to begin enforcing its own new abortion law, cutting off access for anyone later than 12 weeks and imposing strict new regulations on how the state\u2019s clinics could provide abortions. Had Rocky been a week or two later in her pregnancy, her journey \u2014 juggling travel costs, child care and time off for the trip \u2014 may well have been impossible.\u00a0\nShe had made it just in time. And, with the new state laws looming, Rocky could be in the last group of patients able to reliably access abortion care in the American South.\u00a0\n\nIn the year since Roe v. Wade was overturned, a handful of Republican-led states across the country have pushed to outlaw abortion entirely. The impact has been most obvious in the South, where only three states currently allow abortion past six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 and all three are pushing to enforce new restrictions on the procedure. The near-total bans and tight restrictions will disproportionately affect Black Americans \u2014 the majority of whom live in the South, and who already face higher rates of pregnancy-related deaths.\nFlorida, where abortion is currently legal up to 15 weeks, is expected to enforce a six-week ban later this year, pending a ruling from its state Supreme Court. In South Carolina, a legal challenge has blocked enforcement of a newly passed six-week abortion ban for now. It\u2019s not clear how that state\u2019s court will rule, but access in that state is already tenuous: Only three clinics provide abortions, and none go beyond 14 weeks.\nSo if North Carolina\u2019s 12-week abortion ban takes effect July 1, the region will lose one of its last remaining access points for people seeking an abortion. While the law\u2019s 12-week limitation will cut off access for people seeking abortions in the second trimester, clinicians are perhaps most worried about its other provisions: namely, a stipulation that people make two in-person visits to a clinic for an abortion, separated by 72 hours. More than a new time limit on abortion, they said, that provision will make it impossible for most people traveling from out of state to access care in North Carolina.\nOn Wednesday, a federal judge in Greensboro will hear arguments in a lawsuit filed by the state\u2019s Planned Parenthood clinics, who have argued that many of the law\u2019s new provisions are vague, irrational or impossible to comply with. The clinics are asking that the law be blocked from taking effect while the case proceeds.\nCurrently, abortion in North Carolina is allowed up to 20 weeks, and while the state already has a 72-hour waiting period, the first visit currently can be completed over the phone. Almost as soon as Roe fell, North Carolina\u2019s abortion clinics saw a surge in out-of-state patients \u2014 pregnant people from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee flooded the clinics across the state. Floridians who couldn\u2019t meet their state\u2019s 15-week cutoff also traveled to North Carolina. In the first nine months after the Supreme Court decision, North Carolina clinicians performed almost 8,000 more abortions than would have been typical. Only Florida and Illinois recorded larger increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Explore Our Dashboard:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore Our Dashboard:\n\n                        What abortion looks like in every state \u2014 right now\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nAt A Preferred Women\u2019s Health Center, the Charlotte clinic that Rocky visited, that change was visible immediately. Before the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0\u2014 which ended federal abortion protections \u2014 20 to 30 percent of patients were from a state other than North Carolina. Now, that figure has doubled.\u00a0\nThe clinic is one of the centers of the post-Dobbs landscape. Clinic staff estimate that about 40 percent of the out-of-state patients got their abortions at one of A Preferred Women\u2019s Health Center\u2019s North Carolina two health centers, in Charlotte or in Raleigh.\u00a0\nCalla Halle, the clinic\u2019s executive director, has met multiple times with Vice President Kamala Harris, the public face of the Biden administration\u2019s abortion rights response, who spoke in Charlotte on June 24, the one-year anniversary of the Dobbs decision. In her speech, which largely focused on the national impact of overturning Roe, Harris singled out the looming North Carolina law, calling it an \u201cextreme ban\u201d that was passed \u201coverruling the will of the people.\u201d\nOn weekdays, the Charlotte clinic tries to limit capacity to 60 patients; on Fridays and Saturdays, though, the number of people on the schedule approaches 100. The clinic is so busy that workers had to change what abortions they provided. In the past, doctors here performed abortions up to the state\u2019s 20-week limit, a time-intensive procedure best performed over two days. But to see as many patients as possible, they scaled back, asking patients not to schedule an abortion at the clinic if they thought they were later than 13 weeks. If people were further along than they realized, the clinic\u2019s physician on duty would try their best to care for them anyway, as long as they were below 20 weeks.\nNotes written by patients for doctors are seen on a wall at a Planned Parenthood Abortion Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.\n (CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images)\nAs Halle put it, \u201cWe\u2019re slammed.\u201d\nBut in just a matter of days, the picture will likely be dramatically different.\nIn theory, the 12-week ban has some exceptions.\u00a0Patients pregnant as a result of rape or incest could get an abortion up to 20 weeks if they inform their doctor and the doctor reports the crime to law enforcement, which would then have to investigate the case. In the case of fatal fetal anomalies, abortions are allowed up to 24 weeks and throughout pregnancy if the pregnant person\u2019s life is in danger. But physicians fear that those exceptions won\u2019t work in practice. Cases of rape and incest are already rarely reported, and the investigation could serve as a deterrent. The medical exceptions in the law, they say, are too vaguely defined to be applied in practice.\nThe threat of the law is even driving some of North Carolina\u2019s health care providers to consider leaving the state, said Dr. Jonas Swartz, an OBGYN at Duke University who also works at Planned Parenthood in the Raleigh-Durham area. He worries about the patients he sees in clinic \u2014 who have often traveled from across the region \u2014 as well as the patients from North Carolina, whose pregnancies become dangerous and require emergency abortions, but whom he fears won\u2019t be able to find someone willing to provide them appropriate and timely care.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being asked to make all these changes. None of it improves the care,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of it means that on July 1, the care is worse for my patients than it was June 30.\u201d\nWithout North Carolina, it\u2019s not clear where people in the South will be able to go. Even if South Carolina\u2019s six-week ban is blocked, no clinic there provides care past 14 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 already, A Preferred Women\u2019s Health Center cares for South Carolina patients who couldn\u2019t get a timely appointment at home. The next closest options are Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Illinois, a journey that could be more than 1,000 miles. Abortion funds in New York and D.C. \u2014 which spokespeople said already don\u2019t have enough money to cover everyone calling them for help \u2014 are preparing to see even more people travel from the South.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        South Carolina House passes six-week abortion ban\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Carolinas, Florida and Virginia have been quite literally the last stronghold of abortion access in the South. Come July 1, Southerners generally won\u2019t have anywhere to go but north,\u201d said Jade Hurley, of the DC Abortion Fund. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the funding and infrastructure to help everyone past the first trimester or past six weeks.\u201d\nAlready, when people can\u2019t get seen in Charlotte, the clinic tells them to call the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers across the country. There, they hope, someone will be able to refer them to a health center in a state where they can still be seen \u2014\u00a0maybe Illinois or Virginia, maybe even New York or Massachusetts. But the math is turning against them; if Florida\u2019s six-week ban takes effect, and people can\u2019t rely on North Carolina, it\u2019s difficult to believe there will be enough appointment slots to meet everyone\u2019s needs, even with people traveling far further north. And even with financial support, they worry, a growing number of patients will find the journey too long, too daunting to make.\u00a0\nAngela Looper, who directs patient services for A Preferred Women\u2019s Health Center, put it simply: \u201cWomen will die.\u201d\n\nLooper has been working in this field for more than 30 years, getting her first job at a North Carolina clinic after she had an abortion herself. This past year she\u2019s had to tell more patients than ever that there is nothing they can do for them.\u00a0\nSitting at her desk one June morning, Looper checked her computer to see how many patients had been seen, how many more they expected, how far along they were and where they had come from. Looper gasped. Already, there had been one patient who thought she was only 12 weeks pregnant,\u00a0only to discover at her ultrasound that she was in fact 23 weeks along. The closest place she could legally get an abortion was Washington, D.C. Instead, learning that she couldn\u2019t end her pregnancy here, the woman had decided she would keep the pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cShe came in this morning with one mindset. She had to leave with a different one,\u201d Looper said. \u201cI hope these patients have some support in their lives.\u201d\nIt\u2019s incredibly difficult for people to measure how far along they are in pregnancy on their own, and as a result at least one person per day will make it to Charlotte only to be told they can\u2019t get an abortion.\u00a0\nEven for those who can make it in time, the journey is difficult \u2014 financially, physically and emotionally. Looper works directly with patients to help them coordinate their travel, balancing logistics like car rentals, child care and work schedules. Patients already struggled to make the journey up here \u2014\u00a0sometimes, they rented U-Haul vans instead of agency rental cars to make the drive because they were cheaper to book for the day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        Democrats in Congress run full-court press on reproductive rights ahead of Dobbs anniversary\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the new law takes effect, Looper worries especially about the requirement that people make two in-person visits to the clinic. That would mean making the trip to a clinic twice within a week, or booking a hotel to stay in the city for at least five days. Both, she fears, would be prohibitively expensive for the people traveling from out of state.\u00a0\nIn the interim, Halle, who inherited A Preferred Women\u2019s Health Center from her father, a trauma surgeon, is trying desperately to figure out how her clinic would adapt. With days left before North Carolina enforced its new abortion law,\u00a0she still had no idea how they were going to comply.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just watching hysterical breakdowns in real-time,\u201d she said.\nShe still had a million questions, including what the law even meant. Would the state now only let them provide abortions up to 11 weeks and six days? Could they provide care up to 12 weeks and six days? What about the new in-person counseling requirement? How would her clinics be able to see as many patients if they needed to devote space and staff to those meetings, which they used to conduct over the phone?\u00a0\nIt felt like there was hardly any time to figure it out. And in the meantime, patients were still pouring in.\nA woman listens to Vice President Kamala Harris speak on the one year anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 24, 2023.\n (Eric S. Lesser/UPI/AP)\nAn abortion fund covered the trip to Charlotte for Nicole, who traveled from Greenville, South Carolina. Nicole, who asked to use a pseudonym due to privacy concerns, wasn\u2019t able to be seen at the clinic near her home. So instead, she had to take time off work and find someone to drive her two hours north to Charlotte. Someone watched her 3-month-old baby at home.\u00a0\nNicole, 28, had learned she was pregnant again when coming in for an annual physical a few months after giving birth to her son. She was incredibly early in her pregnancy \u2014\u00a0so early that a pregnancy test she had taken only days before the doctor\u2019s visit had been negative.\u00a0\nNicole didn\u2019t believe in abortion. Hearing the protesters outside tell her she was murdering her baby shook her; she kept thinking of all the wanted pregnancies she\u2019d lost \u2014 seven in total. If she had any choice, she would have kept this one.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        Virginia could be key to abortion access in the South. Its laws could hinge on this Democratic primary.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nBut she had felt the physical toll her last pregnancy had taken on her body. She\u2019d had frequent multiple-day stays in the hospital before giving birth, and was due for a follow-up visit with a renal specialist, who would assess how much damage her right kidney had sustained while pregnant. She wouldn\u2019t be surprised, she said, to learn she would need dialysis for the rest of her life.\u00a0\nNot only could Nicole not afford another child financially, but she knew that, given the state her body was in, another pregnancy could kill her. So she came to Charlotte, telling virtually no one why she was here.\n\u201cI feel isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be honest. I\u2019m a person who doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d\nAlready, South Carolina, her home state, records 36.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, per state data published this spring and looking at 2019. Black women, like Nicole, faced a far greater risk, with a death rate of 48.9 per 100,000 live births. In North Carolina, the data is hardly any better: Black women accounted for 43 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths in the state between 2020 and 2022. In the first nine months of 2022, the state recorded 30.9 deaths per 100,000 births.\nWith abortion less available, the numbers will only get worse, experts say. More pregnant people will die preventable deaths \u2014 with Black people particularly vulnerable.\n\u201cThe legislators who have supported this have knowingly put North Carolina\u2019s population at risk,\u201d said Swartz, the Duke physician. \u201cThey have removed something that\u2019s critical for reduction of maternal mortality.\u201d\n\nRocky was exhausted. She\u2019d gotten the abortion pills she needed, taking a dose of mifepristone at the Charlotte clinic and packing the second medication \u2014 misoprostol \u2014 to take from home, back in Georgia. Glancing at the clock, she hoped that she\u2019d make it home by 3, latest 3:30 p.m..\nThe visit had gone as well as it could. The staff at the clinic made her feel safe and supported. She was roughly seven weeks pregnant by now, and hadn\u2019t begun to feel too many symptoms. She\u2019d stocked up maxi pads, ibuprofen and chicken soup at home, hoping the bleeding and cramps from her medication abortion wouldn\u2019t be too terrible.\nSitting in the clinic, she counted out how much the trip had cost her:\u00a0$550 for the abortion, $80 to get her car oil changed first, a full tank of gas each way and food on the road.\nShe figured the money would have to come out of the funds her family had set aside for trips this summer: a family reunion in Cincinnati, and a trip with the kids to Orlando to see her fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents.\u00a0\nPregnancy didn\u2019t fit into their plans right now, let alone another child. They were planning to buy a house soon, and she was looking to change jobs. A baby wouldn\u2019t make those things impossible, but it would make them so much harder. And that was still to say nothing of the medical dangers Rocky, who is Black, knew she could face if she went through with the pregnancy. She\u2019d already given birth to her youngest child during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a health crisis that disproportionately killed Black and Latinx Americans. It was a terrifying experience that she would do anything to avoid repeating.\nA woman, who chose to remain anonymous, has her vitals checked before receiving an abortion at a Planned Parenthood Abortion Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida in July 2022.\n (CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\u201cAs a woman of color, for me, it\u2019s an even bigger risk for me to have a child,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nIt was still so surreal to imagine what would have happened if she\u2019d made her appointment only a few weeks later. She\u2019d still be less than 10 weeks pregnant, early enough to get an abortion in North Carolina. But the trip would be vastly more expensive. Her fianc\u00e9, a firefighter, would have had to take the week off from work. They\u2019d need to find a hotel in Charlotte, somewhere all three kids could stay, or make the four-hour drive twice in a week to meet the 72-hour waiting period requirement.\u00a0\nBut no matter what, she said, she would have done everything to find a way.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how it would have worked out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s something I had to do, I would have done it.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina abortion ban set to take effect after judge\u2019s ruling\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: Abortion in Florida and what\u2019s at stake in the state Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans in North Carolina override veto of 12-week abortion ban\n\n\n\n\nFlorida could be a critical access point for abortion, but the state\u2019s own battle is just starting\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
