The lawsuit was brought by former State Sen. Wendy Davis, best known for her 13-hour filibuster of a 2013 abortion bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n Texas law banning abortion as early as six weeks goes into effect as the U.S. Supreme Court takes no action \n\n\n\n\n        \n          Updated:\n        \n        Sept. 1, 2021\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in April, challenges the 2021 Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which allows private citizens to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d in an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe law is \u201cblatantly unconstitutional\u201d and \u201cmake[s] a mockery of the federal courts,\u201d Davis\u2019 lawsuit alleged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law was designed to be difficult to challenge in court, since no government entities are involved in enforcement. Abortion advocates have struggled to find a way to block the law that doesn\u2019t require them to first violate it and risk a costly civil lawsuit.\nIn this case, Davis and others sued a handful of anti-abortion activists who have threatened to bring civil lawsuits against abortion funds that help Texans access abortion out-of-state. These threats contributed to a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the funds\u2019 operations, and individuals have lost their ability to freely associate with like-minded individuals, the suit said.\nThe original complaint also named state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, who sent cease-and-desist letters to abortion funds, threatening criminal prosecution under the state\u2019s abortion ban. An amended complaint, filed in August, removed Cain from the list of defendants.\nU.S. District Judge Robert Pitman dismissed the suit Wednesday, finding that Davis and the other plaintiffs \u201chave not articulated a credible, imminent threat that can be attributed to Defendants.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defendants have filed court petitions seeking to depose leaders from two other abortion funds to learn about possible prohibited abortions. But as part of this lawsuit, the defendants signed sworn declarations saying they did not intend to sue Davis or the other plaintiffs.\n\u201cIf anything, the specificity of these petitions lessens the threats\u2019 immediacy,\u201d Pitman wrote. \u201cIn short, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently distinguished these threats and the sworn statements disavowing them to show an injury.\u201d\n\u201cWhile yesterday\u2019s ruling is disappointing, it won\u2019t stop us from standing with abortion funds and others who support pregnant people,\u201d said Rupali Sharma, senior counsel at the Lawyering Project, which represented Davis. \u201cShowing up for pregnant people and supporting them in whatever decision they make about their pregnancy is nonnegotiable, and we will never give up on fighting for those fighting for them.\u201d\nMarva Sadler, one of the plaintiffs and senior director of clinical services at Whole Woman\u2019s Health, said in a statement that this decision allows \u201canti-abortion politicians, lawmakers and judges [to] continue to sow fear and confusion in our communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, we will remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to advocate for and challenge any law that prevents Texans from accessing the safe and patient-centered care that they deserve,\u201d Sadler said.\nIn October 2021, Pitman blocked the enforcement of S.B. 8, writing \u201cthis Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.\u201d His order was immediately appealed, and the law has remained in effect since.\nPitman is also overseeing another lawsuit brought by abortion funds, in which the nonprofit groups seek assurances they will not be prosecuted for helping people access abortion in states where the procedure remains legal.\nPitman has not yet ruled on that challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection, Feb. 17, 2023 at 9:22 a.m.:\n\n\nA previous version of this story included the incorrect title for Wendy Davis.
