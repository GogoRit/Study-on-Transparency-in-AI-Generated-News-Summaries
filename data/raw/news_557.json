Some abortion rights activists have taken the fight against abortion bans to the airwaves, feeling they have limited options to speak directly against proposed bans.\nLegislation filed in the Florida House and Senate (SB 744/HB 351) would ban abortions beginning at 20 weeks of pregnancy except to avoid serious health risks for the expectant mothers. However, when lawmakers host public testimony on the perennially controversial topic this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, availability to testify will be limited.\nFor pre-Session committee weeks, the Senate is not allowing in-person testimony except from invited speakers. Others wishing to address proposed bills must be livestreamed in from the Leon County Civic Center.\nThe House is allowing in-person testimony, but people must reserve a seat online from a limited pool. Expanded on-site virtual testimony is available for \u201cissues of great public significance and when scheduling allows,\u201d according to House leadership.\nDespite those options, Laura Goodhue, Executive Director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, contended lawmakers should offer the public more speaking opportunities. She made that argument during a Zoom press conference hosting women from across the country who received late term abortions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, and the Florida Legislature should have a way for people to provide remote testimony, but they don\u2019t, so we\u2019re using this platform to speak out against yet another attack on abortion access in Florida,\u201d Goodhue said.\nPublic testimony is frequently limited to a couple of minutes during committee hearings. But on hot-button issues with a long list of speakers, individuals are often limited to a minute to say their piece.\nDuring the \u201cMics On, Bans Off\u201d event, Goodhue said that is not enough time to tell a story as personal as receiving an abortion.\n\u201cFlorida has a lot of weighty issues before them, and I think that it\u2019s extremely important that the public do have that opportunity to shape legislation, and it\u2019s unfortunate that with the technology we have at hand that the Florida Legislature is not opening it up for the public,\u201d she added.\nThe liberal watchdog group Common Cause Florida is circulating a petition requesting the Legislature allow the public to testify remotely without traveling to Tallahassee.\nLegislative leaders have not yet announced COVID-19 protocols for when the Session begins on March 2.\nSenate President Wilton\u00a0Simpson told reporters recently that the current rules will likely go unchanged in his chamber. However, he will assemble a working group over the summer to explore allowing remote testimony in future sessions.\nDian Alarc\u00f3n, speaking through a Spanish-to-English translator, told the story of aborting what would have been her third child. She called terminating her pregnancy an act of love and responsibility.\n\u201cWe were just trying to get by in the country, and neither my husband nor I had a stable job that would allow us to support my pregnancy,\u201d Alarc\u00f3n said. \u201cWithout health insurance or access to any care, it would be irresponsible for us to continue with the pregnancy.\u201d\nGuerdy Remy\u00a0shared how she learned of her pregnancy at nearly 20 weeks of gestation. She was 17 and living at home in Brooklyn, New York, while close to graduating from high school.\n\u201cThat was my first time seeing any medical professional and knowing for sure that I was pregnant,\u201d she wrote in prepared remarks.\nDoral Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez and Sarasota Rep.\u00a0Tommy Gregory, both Republicans are sponsoring the bills.\nIn June, Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis signed legislation preventing most abortions for minors who don\u2019t have a parent\u2019s consent. An exception in the law allows minors to go through the courts to waive parental consent.\n\n Post Views: 975\n\n\n\n\n\nRenzo Downey\nRenzo Downey covers state government for Florida Politics.
