They are just not going to take it any more. This is very unsettling for a lot of people,\u201d explained Ammar Rashid,\u00a0president of the Punjab chapter of Awami Workers\u2019 Party,\u00a0a left-wing political party that supported the marches.\n\u201cThe thought of a women\u2019s march advocating women\u2019s rights shakes patriarchy to the very core.\u201d\nFatima Hassan is a student activist who attended the march in Karachi. \u201cI\u2019m a young woman [and] I\u2019m here today because I don\u2019t feel comfortable walking alone at night,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here for all those women who couldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\nIn recent months, Pakistan has seen a wave of protests \u2013 by women demanding equality, students demanding the reinstatement of student unions and ethnic groups demanding their rights.\u00a0\nTooba Syed is the political representative\u00a0of the Women\u2019s Democratic Front and one of the organisers of the Islamabad march. She feels that all of the recent protest movements have one thing in common: they are being led by the country\u2019s progressive youth.\nAnd among the youth, women are becoming particularly vocal, she says.\n\u201cThe space for women is growing. I see many more women engaging today than I did perhaps five years ago. I remember being the only woman at some protests and sometimes I would be joined by maybe two or three more women but today that has changed.\u201d\nThe backlash\nBut if more women are feeling empowered to come out and march, it has not come without a backlash.\nSome of the signs carried at last year\u2019s marches attracted a lot of animosity. Among them were posters addressing unwanted sexual advances, explicit photos women receive from men online and even the \u201ccorrect way\u201d for a woman to sit.\n\nAurat March, Slogans and\u00a0Posters https://t.co/5cz5m4zlqS pic.twitter.com/iL4cLDcrq9\n\u2014 Bina Shah (@BinaShah) March 9, 2019\n\nAs this year\u2019s march approached, those who opposed it became more vocal.\nMaulana Fazl ur Rehman, the leader of the religious right-wing political party Jamiat\u00a0Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F), asked law enforcement bodies to take action to stop the marches.\n\u201cIf they want to bring awareness to the issues that are faced today in society, if they are associated with rights for women granted to them in Islam and the constitution we have absolutely no problem with that. What occurred last year was against the norms of culture and society. So much so that I cannot even bring myself to speak of them,\u201d he told Al Jazeera in a telephone interview.\nAt least three petitions were filed in courts across the country with the aim of stopping the marches. A petition in Islamabad was filed by JUI-F and Umme Hassan, wife of the Muslim leader from Islamabad\u2019s Lal Masjid.\nNone of the petitions was successful.\u00a0\nLawyer Azhar Siddique,\u00a0one of the petitioners whose case was dismissed by the\u00a0Lahore High Court, argues that the entire movement is part of a Western agenda to ruin the culture of Pakistan. \u201cI have worked for women\u2019s rights more than these people [the marchers]. And where in Pakistan other than a few places has there been discrimination against women?\u201d\u00a0he told Al Jazeera.\nNighat Dad, a lawyer and one of the organisers of the march in Lahore, disagreed.\n\u201cIs it not true that children are raped and killed every other day? Is it not true that girls are deprived of education? Is it not true that women who have to walk to their workplaces are harassed on the streets?  Is it not true that women face the double burden of making money as well as taking care of children and the entire household? If all of this is true, then why create such a stupid drama about one or two posters?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear or see women taking to the streets against economic injustice and patriarchal violence that are both tied in together,\u201d Dad added.\nAccording to the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (2012-13), almost 32 percent of women have experienced physical violence in Pakistan and 40 percent of ever-married women have suffered spousal abuse at some point in their life. \n These numbers are likely to be an underestimate as, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), one in two Pakistani women who have experienced violence never sought help or told anyone about it.\nAccording to Human Right Watch, 32 percent of primary school age girls are out of school in Pakistan, compared with 21 percent of boys. By ninth grade, only 13 percent of girls are still in school.\nSilencing\nThere are other types of opposition the organisers must navigate. \n On March 3, in Islamabad, a mural of\u00a0artwork made by people involved with the women\u2019s march was destroyed by students from a nearby religious school within hours of it going up.\n\nPosters for the women\u2019s march were ripped off walls in Lahore [Amal Awais Chughtai/Al Jazeera]\u00a0\n\nOn February 23, in Lahore, posters made by march\u00a0volunteers and participants were torn down.\nRecently, an exchange between\u00a0Khalil ur Rehman Qamar, a well-known television serial writer, and writer Marvi Sirmed, that was aired live on a debate-style show on Neo News went viral. In it, Qamar shouted abuse at Sirmed over the My Body, My Choice slogan.\nNeo News CEO Nasrullah Malik subsequently apologised to Sirmend on social media.\u00a0\n\n@marvisirmed Please accept my sincere apology on the incident which happened today on our screen. Being Head of NEO NEWS I am extremely sorry for that and strict action will be taken. We condemn the behaviour of Khalil Qamar. Nasrullah MalikExecutive Director NEO NEWS\n\u2014 Nasrullah Malik (@NasrullahMalik1) March 3, 2020\n\n\u201cMen like Khalilul Rehman Qamar want to deflect attention from the fact that the global economic crisis is begetting social movements pioneered by women and that is why they make so much noise about a select few placards,\u201d said Dad.\n\u201cThe foundations of patriarchy stand challenged today and since these foundations are so fragile, their guardians have jumped into action and are resorting to every measure in their capacities to ensure that women are back to being silenced.\u201d\nAl Jazeera attempted to reach Qamar for a comment but was unable to.\n\nA mural that was defaced in Islamabad [Asad Hashim/Al Jazeera]\u00a0\n\nReligious parties\nIn advance of Sunday\u2019s marches, a smaller rally of approximately 300 people was held on Saturday night in Sukkur, in the southern province of Sindh.\nArfana Mallah has been an activist in Pakistan\u2019s Sindh province for more than 20 years. She is from\u00a0Women\u2019s Action Forum, a leading women\u2019s rights organisation, and one of the co-founders of the Sukkur rally.\nShe chose Sukkur because, according to data compiled by Women\u2019s Action Forum, in the last year there have been at least 50 forced conversions and marriages of women from religious minorities in the city.\n\u201cThe slander on social media against us is insufferable,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are thousands of posts they are putting up constantly against us, and saying we are vulgar and immoral women and it\u2019s acceptable to kill us for the sake of honour.\u201d\nShe believes Pakistan\u2019s powerful right-wing religious parties are particularly concerned by the women\u2019s movement for equality because they cannot\u00a0control it.\n\u201cAnd if women step out of [the limited role they allow them] what will they have left to define chastity on?\u201d she said of these parties.\nPushpa Kumari is an activist from Hyderabad who works to stop forced kidnappings, conversions and marriages of Hindu girls who attended the march in Karachi. She said many of the girls affected are between the ages of 10 and 14.\n\u201cThose girls cannot be here today,\u201d she said. \u201cThose girls are broken down so much that there is nothing left.\n\u201cThere are two girls from my family who were kidnapped; we don\u2019t even know if they are alive,\u201d she added.\n\nHindu community activist Pushpa Kumari attended the march in Karachi [Alia Chughtai/Al Jazeera]\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t know the women of Pakistan\u2019\nIn February 1983, a group of women marched through the streets of Lahore, despite martial law which prohibited gatherings of more than two people.\nThey were met by police who hit them with batons and arrested them.\u00a0\nThe protest was against the law of evidence, which would reduce the testimony of a woman to half that of a man.\nFarida Shaheed was there that day in 1983, and today she helps younger women protest.\nShe says the marchers were called immoral back then too.\u00a0The only difference then, she adds, is that people seemed particularly alarmed by women having short hair, whereas that does not seem to be such a concern now.\n\u201cThere is a \u2026 so-called politics of respectability,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat is respectable and what is not, what is permissible and what is not is a debate.\n\u201cMy fundamental question is, who defines what is respectable and what is not? The problem is that these people don\u2019t seem to know the women of Pakistan any more. They are completely mistaken about where this country and its women\u00a0are.\n\u201cWe have incredibly talented, innovative, powerful, active young women and they are coming together with the older and we are all united,\u201d she said.\nNadira Hasnain was nine years old when Pakistan came into being in 1947. She sat perched on a chair near the stage at the Karachi rally.\n\u201cHow society has evolved frightens me,\u201d she explained. \u201cIn my family and growing up in a newly made Pakistan, the education of women wasn\u2019t questioned. The safety of women wasn\u2019t an issue.\u201d\n\nNadira Hasnain says she attended the march in \u2018solidarity with all those girls who don\u2019t get a chance to be educated\u2019 [Alia Chughtai/Al Jazeera]\n\nGhinwa Bhutto, the wife of Murtaza Bhutto, the slain brother of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, also attended the march in Karachi.\u00a0\n\u201cFinally, spring is here,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cThis movement, along with other movements, is a sign that \u2026 people are getting stronger and the rulers are getting weaker.\u201d\n\u201cThe people want discourse. There is a change in what people are willing to accept. Being gay, lesbian, gender issues, socialism, progressive politics \u2013 this is all being slowly accepted and absorbed by the people.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
