Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n      \n\n\n\n\nAbby Johnson came to the Republican National Convention with a very simple message: if you oppose abortion, you have to vote for Donald Trump.\n\u201cHe has done more for the unborn than any other president,\u201d the anti-abortion activist said in her speech on Tuesday night, before listing some of Trump\u2019s actions to limit abortion, including his reinstatement of the global gag rule, which bars health care providers abroad that receive US aid from performing or discussing abortions. \nThen she delivered an impassioned plea to abortion opponents like her: \u201cThis election is a choice between two radical anti-life activists and the most pro-life president we have ever had. That is something that should compel you to action, go door-to-door, make calls, talk to your neighbors and friends, and vote on November 3.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a strategy that worked once before. In 2016, Trump was hardly a natural choice for many evangelical voters and other social conservatives. He didn\u2019t know much about the Bible, he doesn\u2019t seem to understand the basics of a church service, and, of course, he\u2019d been caught on tape bragging about his ability to grab women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d\nBut Trump made a big promise to evangelical voters and other opponents of abortion: when he was elected, Roe v. Wade would be overturned \u201cautomatically.\u201d It wasn\u2019t his only appeal to evangelicals, but it likely contributed to his overwhelming win with white voters in this demographic in 2016.\nNow, there may be even more stacked against Trump. His disastrous response to the Covid-19 pandemic has left nearly 200,000 Americans dead. The economy is in crisis. What\u2019s more, he hasn\u2019t actually been able to fulfill his biggest promise to anti-abortion voters: despite his nomination of two conservative justices, Roe, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established Americans\u2019 right to an abortion, still stands, at least for now. \nBut Johnson and others are betting that for the most committed abortion opponents, the prospect of a Biden-Harris administration friendly to abortion rights will be enough to convince them not just to give Trump a second chance \u2014 but to bring their friends and neighbors along. And they might be right.\nJohnson\u2019s speech laid out the anti-abortion case for Trump\nJohnson was a natural choice to deliver this message. She\u2019s not an elected official but, at this point in her career, a bit of a celebrity \u2014 perhaps like Trump himself.\nOnce the director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas, Johnson resigned in 2009 \u2014 after, she says, watching an ultrasound-guided abortion changed her mind about the procedure. She later wrote a book about her experience, made into the 2019 film Unplanned, which overperformed, especially in red states.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nUnplanned, the anti-abortion movie that\u2019s getting mainstream attention, explained\n\nJohnson came under criticism ahead of her convention speech for comments made earlier this year that police would be \u201csmart\u201d to racially profile her son, who is biracial. \u201cStatistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons,\u201d she said in a YouTube video, as Vice News reported. (Johnson responded to criticism on Tuesday by tweeting that abortion-rights advocates were \u201cSO scared of my speech tonight\u201d that \u201cthey are scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message\u201d.)\nStill, she began her speech by calling out Planned Parenthood for racism, repeating the false claim that the group strategically places clinics in majority-minority neighborhoods. \nShe then detailed Trump\u2019s accomplishments for the anti-abortion cause, including a rule allowing health care workers to refuse to perform abortions and the appointment of \u201ca record number of pro-life judges, including two Supreme Court justices.\u201d\nWhile Trump has indeed taken a number of executive actions to restrict abortion, his judicial appointments can\u2019t be called an unqualified win for the anti-abortion side \u2014 yet. With the addition of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both appointed by Trump, many were hoping that the Supreme Court this year in the case June Medical Services v. Russo would overturn or at least significantly weaken Roe. That didn\u2019t happen \u2014 instead, the Court found in favor of an abortion clinic and blocked a Louisiana abortion restriction.\nThe result is that Trump\u2019s 2020 sales pitch to abortion opponents isn\u2019t as strong as it could have been \u2014 but with a second term, he might have a better chance of fully delivering.\nWith four liberal justices remaining on the Court, many say conservatives don\u2019t have the votes yet to overturn Roe outright. But if Trump gets reelected, he is likely to be able to appoint at least one more justice. That would give conservatives a much better chance than they had this year of reversing the landmark abortion decision.\nOf course, evangelicals also have more reasons than ever not to vote for Trump \u2014 his cavalier attitude toward the deaths of Americans, for example. And there\u2019s some evidence that Trump\u2019s approval rating is slipping even with the evangelical voters who overwhelmingly backed him in 2016.\nJohnson\u2019s role, then, was to remind such voters that one of their biggest prizes is not yet won, and that they need to reelect Trump to win it.\n\u201cTake action that reelects our president and do it with our very most vulnerable Americans in mind,\u201d she urged them in closing her speech. \u201cThe ones who have not been born yet.\u201d\n\nNew goal: 25,000 \nIn the spring, we launched a program asking readers for financial contributions to help keep Vox free for everyone, and last week, we set a goal of reaching 20,000 contributors.
