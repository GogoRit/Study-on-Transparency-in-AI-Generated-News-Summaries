It wasn\u2019t because he no longer loved taking care of babies, nor did he want to leave the hospital.\u00a0Instead, he resolved to help babies by helping their moms first.\u00a0Phillips founded Life on Wheels, a nonprofit\u00a0organization that provides free ultrasounds and pregnancy tests to women in Montgomery and Birmingham through three mobile clinics. These services cost $150 and $25 respectively at local clinics.\u00a0He currently serves as the Life on Wheels president and continues to work as a gynecologist from his office on Taylor Road.\u00a0\u201cI realized the power of ultrasound in empowering a woman to make a decision about her pregnancy,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt does change your life, a child, but just like all crises in our lives, if someone can step alongside you and help you, most crises can be overcome. So that's kind of what we do with the bus.\u201dThe Montgomery-based Life On Wheels bus parks across the street from abortion providers, pro-life pregnancy centers\u00a0and on the Alabama State University campus throughout the week.The organization itself is staunchly against\u00a0abortion, and while the nonprofit workers hope each woman will decide to parent, Phillips said the function of Life On Wheels is not to advocate against it. He said their volunteers and employees do not berate women or picket in front of abortion clinics.\u00a0\u201cWe're unashamedly pro-life, and we'd like to see abortion go away, but that's not the purpose of our bus. Our bus is to love women where they are and meet them where they are. We think that's the way Christ would do it,\u201d Phillips said.\u00a0Life on Wheels executive director Robyn Blessing seconded Phillips's statement. She said the women who staff the bus every day set up signs and pass out coupons advertising the free services, but they don't engage in political conversations or pro-life versus pro-choice debates.\u00a0\"It's not our job to talk a woman into or out of an abortion,\" Blessing said. \"We aren't going to overstep another physician, and if they do choose to abort, we still love them.\"Blessing met Phillips several years\u00a0ago,\u00a0after she had gotten an abortion herself, and\u00a0he is one of the most genuine people she knows.\u00a0\"He is selfless and nonjudgmental,\" she said. \"He really lives what he believes.\"Raising a child is a large responsibility, but when a woman who utilizes Life On Wheels\u2019 resources struggles to stay afloat, Phillips said his organization does everything it can to help her.\u00a0He told the story of one of their former patients who lost her job and almost lost her house after giving birth. When she called the organization for help, one of the board members was able to get Catholic Social Services to pay two months of her rent, and she ultimately got her job back.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019re doing our job really well,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt is a unique story, though, I confess. We\u2019ve seen over 5,000 women, so if we were doing that for every single one of them, it would be a lot.\u201d\u00a0The usual outcome of a woman getting an ultrasound from Life On Wheels is that she either decides to parent and gets connected with a local pregnancy center or she decides to continue with her abortion.Either way, Phillips said he hopes his team is making a positive impact.\u00a0Since Life on Wheels opened its first mobile medical unit in the River Region on Dec. 27, 2016, it has seen over 4,400 clients in the area. Many of them had decided to parent their babies before visiting the unit, but Life on Wheels\u2019\u00a0records show that 284 women changed their minds about getting an abortion after the ultrasound.\u00a0When Phillips started Life on Wheels, his goal was to have a mobile pregnancy clinic across the street from every abortion clinic in the state. Now, he has two cities left that he wants to expand into\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Tuscaloosa and Huntsville.\u00a0As the right to an abortion continues to be debated on a national scale, Phillips has no plans to delve into the politics of women's health and abortion access. Instead, he hopes to stay focused on growing his nonprofit and resolving misconceptions around his work.\u00a0\"We're not angry,\" he said. \"We\u00a0love the woman. We love the baby. We love the people across the street.\"About the seriesThe Montgomery Advertiser's People to Watch is a series of stories about everyday Alabamians\u00a0we believe will do exceptional things in our communities in the coming year. Our readers and journalists\u00a0nominated this year's slate. The Advertiser will publish profiles about\u00a0these honorees from\u00a0Dec. 23 through early January.Three questions with Dr. Matthew PhillipsWhat is Montgomery's\u00a0greatest attribute?\"I think the reason that I love the city is we are sitting, in this time in history, in a better position to impact our nation on the issues that affect our nation than any city in America.\u00a0\"Could Montgomery be the one city that could say, 'If we can change, if we can bring reconciliation to this city, if this city can be reconciled, then our whole country could be reconciled?'\u00a0So to me, that's the coolest thing about being in Montgomery. We have the potential to impact the country and maybe even the world on the issue of racial reconciliation.\"What did the pandemic teach you about yourself?\"I learned a lot about fear. I think the whole pandemic is plagued with fear. Fear of death, fear of losing a family member, fear of the vaccine, the whole thing is plagued with fear, and we made a lot of decisions based on fear, some good, some bad.\u00a0\"But I learned a lot about dealing with fear and in trusting God that he has a sovereign plan for my life.\"Name somebody in the community who inspires you.\"John Geiger inspires me. He was the headmaster at Eastwood Christian School and about two years ago now died of ALS. He was inspiring me long before he got ALS, but then when he got ALS, he showed me how to die and how to die well.\"Hadley Hitson covers the rural South for the Montgomery Advertiser and Report for America.
