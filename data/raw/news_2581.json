Wade\u201d fame) played the part of an anti-abortion crusader in exchange for money.Cassie da CostaFormer Entertainment WriterUpdated\u00a0May 19, 2020\u00a07:12PM EDT\u00a0/\u00a0Published\u00a0May 19, 2020\u00a011:59AM EDT\u00a0In its final 20 minutes, the documentary film AKA Jane Roe delivers quite the blow to conservatives who have weaponized the story of Jane Roe herself\u2014real name, Norma McCorvey\u2014to argue that people with uteruses should have to carry any and all pregnancies to term. McCorvey, who died in 2017, became Jane Roe when, as a young homeless woman, she was unable to get a legal or safe abortion in the state of Texas. Her willingness to lend her experience to the legal case for abortion led to the passing of Roe v. Wade in 1973, which legalized abortions in all 50 states (though red states do all they can to get around this; recently, several have even used the COVID-19 pandemic to make abortions functionally impossible to procure). But conservatives had a field day in the mid '90s when the assertive, media-savvy pro-choice advocate and activist McCorvey became an anti-abortion born-again ex-gay Christian with the help of leaders of the evangelical Christian right, Reverend Flip Benham (of the infamous Operation Rescue) and Reverend Rob Schenck. A conservative film, Roe v. Wade, starring Jon Voight and Stacey Dash, will dramatize McCorvey\u2019s \u201cconversion.\u201d   But those filmmakers, and the rest of the pro-life evangelical community, have another curveball coming. In the final third of director Nick Sweeney\u2019s 79-minute documentary, featuring many end-of-life reflections from McCorvey\u2014who grew up queer, poor, and was sexually abused by a family member her mother sent her to live with after leaving reform school\u2014the former Jane Roe admits that her later turn to the anti-abortion camp as a born-again Christian was \u201call an act.\u201d \u201cThis is my deathbed confession,\u201d she chuckles, sitting in a chair in her nursing home room, on oxygen. Sweeney asks McCorvey, \u201cDid [the evangelicals] use you as a trophy?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d she replies. \u201cI was the Big Fish.\u201d \u201cDo you think you would say that you used them?\u201d Sweeney responds. \u201cWell,\u201d says McCorvey, \u201cI think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201d She even gives an example of her scripted anti-abortion lines. \u201cI\u2019m a good actress,\u201d she points out. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not acting now.\u201d   \u201cI think it was a mutual thing. I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201d Sweeney shows the video of McCorvey\u2019s confession to her friends and acquaintances on the pro-abortion and anti-abortion sides, including pro-choice activist Charlotte Taft who, on the verge of tears, says, \u201cThat just really hurts because it\u2019s big stakes. It\u2019s just really big stakes.\u201d Reverend Schenck, the much more reasonable of the two evangelical leaders featured in the film, also watches the confession and is taken aback. But he\u2019s not surprised, and easily corroborates, saying, \u201cI had never heard her say anything like this\u2026 But I knew what we were doing. And there were times when I was sure she knew. And I wondered, Is she playing us? What I didn\u2019t have the guts to say was, because I know damn well we\u2019re playing her.\u201d Reverend Schenck admits that McCorvey was \u201ca target,\u201d a \u201cneedy\u201d person in need of love and protection, and that \u201cas clergy,\u201d people like Schenck and Benham were \u201cused to those personalities\u201d and thus easily able to exploit her weaknesses. He also confirms that she was \u201ccoached on what to say\u201d in her anti-abortion speeches. Benham denies McCorvey was paid; Schenck insists she was, saying that \u201cat a few points, she was actually on the payroll, as it were.\u201d AKA Jane Roe finds documents disclosing at least $456,911 in \u201cbenevolent gifts\u201d from the anti-abortion movement to McCorvey.   Reverend Benham then blurts out, \u201cYeah, but she chose to be used. That\u2019s called work. That\u2019s what you\u2019re paid to be doing!\u201d Schenck\u2019s thinking is quite different: \u201cFor Christians like me, there is no more important or authoritative voice than Jesus,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018What does it profit in the end if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul?\u2019 When you do what we did to Norma, you lose your soul.\u201dIn fact, Reverend Schenck underlines his own conversion, which took place in the last decade: \u201cI still identify as an evangelical, but I like to think of myself as lovingly critical of my community. I guess in some ways I\u2019d like to use whatever years I have remaining to undo the damage that I did and that many movement leaders did on the pro-life side. I used to think that Roe v. Wade would never be overturned. I think Roe v. Wade could be overturned now. And I think the result of that would be chaos and pain. And to impose that kind of crisis on a woman is unthinkable.\u201d Advertisement  \u201c\u2018AKA Jane Roe\u2019 finds documents disclosing at least $456,911 in \u2018benevolent gifts\u2019 from the anti-abortion movement to McCorvey.\u201d Another crisis the evangelicals imposed was that of their homophobic teachings. To be born-again, McCorvey was required to stop having a romantic relationship with her long-time girlfriend\u2014and, for a while, her only family\u2014Connie. According to interviews, this confused and hurt Connie, though she stayed in the relationship for a decade after McCorvey\u2019s conversion. Eventually, in 2004, Connie had a stroke; McCorvey moved out after a few years. Connie died two years before McCorvey, in 2015. McCorvey always kept mementos from their romance, including jewelry Connie gave her, and expresses profound sadness over Connie\u2019s death in the documentary. Unfortunately, AKA Jane Roe never explains why, if McCorvey\u2019s born-again anti-abortion stance was all for the money, she would\u2019ve ended her romantic relationship with Connie while continuing their domestic one. And if, on the contrary, the relationship wasn\u2019t really over, then what could explain Connie\u2019s anguished interviews\u2014surely, the act of a conservatory-trained actor if they, too, were a ruse?  AKA Jane Roe does succeed at painting a complex portrait of McCorvey, who was punished for being attracted to women from the time she was ten years old and ran away with a girlfriend. (After being caught at a hotel, where the two conned their way to a room, police asked the very young McCorvey if she had committed sodomy, and after clarifying what they meant by that, she said yes.) Throughout the documentary, McCorvey closely resembles her pre-'90s self, wisecracking and uninhibited. \u201cI wonder how many abortions Donald Trump is responsible for,\u201d she offers. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s lost count, if he can count that high.\u201d Her sardonic manner also comes with serious wisdom: \u201cIf a young woman wants to have an abortion\u2014fine,\u201d she says, coloring in the nursing home. \u201cThat\u2019s no skin off my ass. You know, that\u2019s why they call it \u2018choice.\u2019 It\u2019s your choice.\u201d  Cassie da CostaFormer Entertainment Writer@tooearnestGot a tip?
