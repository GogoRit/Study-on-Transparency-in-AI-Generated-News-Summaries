Now, some abortion opponents want to turn that idea into law.Legislators in at least three states\u2014Arizona, North Dakota and Mississippi\u2014introduced bills for the 2021 legislative session that would allow prosecutors to charge abortion providers with murder, as part of a massive wave of anti-abortion legislation that\u2019s flooding statehouses across the country. So far this session, at least 143 abortions restrictions have been introduced in 25 states, and there's likely more to come.Advertisement\u201cIf you want to spout, \u2018My body, my body choice,\u2019 you need to spend some time in our Arizona penal system,\u201d Arizona State Rep. Walt Blackman, who introduced a bill this year that would punish both abortion providers and patients, said in August. \u201cIf you are going to kill and end the life of another human being, that is murder.\u201dAnd regardless of whether they become law, just introducing a bill that labels an abortion provider a murderer has an impact, according to Elizabeth Nash, who tracks abortion legislation for the Guttmacher Institute.\u00a0\u201cThey essentially set a goal post that abortion would be illegal and a provider could be charged with murder\u2014and then all other restrictions look so much more moderate,\u201d Nash said.\u00a0Between GOP control of several state governments and a conservative Supreme Court, the U.S. is primed to kick off a kind of abortion arms race this year. States are already trying to pass laws that were once believed too politically poisonous to ever succeed.Prosecuting people for \u201chomicide by abortion,\u201d as Blackman\u2019s bill proposes in Arizona, is an unpopular suggestion even among opponents of abortion. But that\u2019s not the only extreme idea in there.\u00a0AdvertisementUnder his bill, the legal definition of \u201cperson\u201d would include \u201can unborn child in the womb at any stage of development.\u201d There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\u00a0In Mississippi and North Dakota, anti-abortion legislators are not only hoping to charge abortion providers with murder; they also want to expand the circle of people who could face criminal prosecution in connection to an abortion. Under the Mississippi bill in the current legislative session, anyone who even provides information about how to get an abortion could up to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. In North Dakota, anyone who \u201cintentionally or knowingly aids, abets, facilitates, solicits, or incites another person to commit an abortion\u201d may end up spending five years in prison and facing a $10,000 fine.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear whether any of these bills will pass. But if they do, they\u2019ll almost certainly be challenged in court, where they\u2019ll likely be stopped from taking effect as the case continues.They are also doing the work of mainstreaming ideas that were long considered fringe, even within the anti-abortion movement. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that abortion legislation that was once thought to be politically poisonous ended up becoming law.\u00a0In 2011, when anti-abortion activists first championed the idea of banning abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy, many in the anti-abortion movement dismissed it as a rash ploy that would turn off people who would otherwise support anti-abortion legislation. But by 2019, in the wake of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, five states passed six-week bans, even though many people don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant at that stage.\u00a0AdvertisementOne state went even further in 2019: Alabama banned all abortions, except in the case of pregnancies that posed a \u201cserious health risk\u201d to the pregnant person. Doctors who performed abortions could go to jail for up to 99 years.\u00a0The six-week ban passed in Georgia that year also legally redefined \u201can unborn child\u201d as a person, complete with all the \u201cfull legal protection\u201d conferred by such a status. Prosecutors could use that statute to push for murder charges against abortion providers\u2014just as they could for anyone who murdered an adult human.These laws were all halted by legal challenges, but that was no surprise to their backers. In fact, teeing up a lawsuit is part of the point of passing abortion restrictions that fly in the face of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. They can give the Supreme Court a chance to reconsider Roe\u2014or knock it down entirely.So far this year, legislators in at least three states have introduced six-week bans, according to Nash. Lawmakers in eight states have proposed near-total bans on abortion.When Democrats captured the White House and Congress in 2020, they opened up the opportunity to restore federal policies that could expand abortion access. But most abortion law is crafted at the state level, and Democrats\u2019 efforts to flip statehouses were far less successful: Only two state legislative chambers, both in New Hampshire, switched party control\u2014in favor of the GOP. Twenty-one states are now firmly under Republican control, compared to 15 run by Democrats and 13 that are divided between the two parties, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. (Nebraska has a nonpartisan, unicameral legislature.)The Supreme Court is also firmly under the sway of a conservative majority, thanks to Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s October confirmation to the nation\u2019s highest court. Opponents of the procedure believe that they finally have a court that\u2019s willing to overturn Roe.Tagged:abortionsAbortion Rightsreproductive rightswomen's rightsGOPArizonaPoliticsGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
