On May 8, 1970, a convoy of feminist advocates, activists, and leaders travelled from Vancouver to Ottawa to protest life-threatening policy that criminalized abortion. They chained themselves to their seats, and demanded that Parliamentarians face the reality of how the law harmed so many. These incredible feminists were a major part of the change that led to the decriminalization of abortion in 1988.\nIn the decades since, multiple generations of activists, policy makers and advocates have built on this powerful legacy, and the fight is far from over. With the combined support of people across Canada, movements relentlessly pressed forward for all people to claim their human rights to health, safety, and non-discrimination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nA coalition of groups and individuals who support reproductive rights have come together to plan events and initiatives for the 50th anniversary. Our 2020 Caravan coalition consists of over a dozen women who were part of the original 1970 Caravan, as well as pro-choice groups, sexual health centres, abortion clinics, labour unions, researchers, archivists, authors, and others.\nJoin us online in May to commemorate the 1970 Abortion Caravan and continue our work to achieve reproductive justice for all.\n\u00a0\n\n \nGet Involved and Learn More \n\n \n\nRead \u201cThen and Now: Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the 1970 Abortion Caravan\u201d\nRead a reproductive justice primer on the history of abortion rights organizing in Canada from 1970 to present\n\n\n\n \n\nWatch our virtual conversation \nMay 4: a conversation and launch of Karin Wells\u2019 new book The Abortion Caravan: When Women Shut Down the Government in the Battle for the Right to Choose, featuring some original Abortion Caravaners \n\n\n\n\n \n\nCheck out the Rise Up! archive\nRise Up! project aims to create a digital archive of original publications, documents, flyers, posters, and many other materials representing feminist activism from the 1970s to 1990s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis app features content from the Your Sexual Health Hub and is available if you are offline.
