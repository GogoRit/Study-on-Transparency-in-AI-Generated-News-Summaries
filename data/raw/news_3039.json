A Catholic bishop in Texas slammed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Twitter over a comment she made appearing to compare the abortion debate in the United States to rapes committed by soldiers in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine and Taliban rule.    \"Please, please don\u2019t listen to this evil woman,\" Bishop Joseph Strickland of the Diocese of Tyler, Texas, tweeted on Friday. \"Her lies and immorality need to be silenced for the good of humanity.\"Strickland\u2019s post was accompanied by an article highlighting comments made by the former Democratic presidential candidate at the Clinton Presidential Center's summit on women\u2019s rights, where she was asked by interviewer Christiane Amanpour about a past statement she made that women\u2019s rights were \"unfinished business.\"  \"We have come a long way since I made that statement, back in 1995, on so many fronts,\" Clinton responded. \"But we are also in a period of time where there is a lot of pushback and much of the progress that has been, I think, taken for granted by too many people is under attack.\"  HILLARY CLINTON ROASTED FOR LATEST 'BASKET OF DEPLORABLES' MOMENT: HER EGO IS 'PREPOSTEROUS'  Hillary Clinton discusses President Biden's \"MAGA Republicans\" speech on \"The View\" in September. (ABC The View)  \"Literally under attack, in places like Iran or Afghanistan or Ukraine, where rape is a tactic of war, or under attack by political and cultural forces in a country like our own, when it comes to women's health care and bodily autonomy.\"Representatives for Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

(Cindy Ord/Getty Images)Clinton also used the abortion debate to invoke the suffering of women in Sudan while speaking at the summit.  \"It\u2019s so shocking to think that in any way we\u2019re related to poor Afghanistan and Sudan,\" Clinton said. \"But as an advanced economy, as we allegedly are, on this measure, we unfortunately are rightly put with them.\"    Sudan\u2019s Islamist state bans abortion except for when a woman was raped or her life is in danger. Afghanistan\u2019s Islamist state bans abortion except for when the mother\u2019s life in danger.THE END OF ROE HAS PREVENTED AT LEAST 10,000 LEGAL ABORTIONS: REPORT  Hillary Clinton is promoting Indivisible\u2019s Crush the Coup campaign to \"make sure we\u2019re ready to defend Democracy\" in 2024. (Mike Smith/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)Following the reversal of Roe v. Wade earlier this year, states across the U.S. are allowed to impose their own rules on abortion, and while some have put in place sharp limits on abortion, many others allow abortion up through the final weeks of pregnancy. Clinton suggested limits on abortion are undemocratic.    \"This struggle is between autocracy and democracy, from our country to places we can\u2019t even believe we\u2019re being compared to,\" Clinton said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPClinton spoke about abortion in another appearance this week with The 19th, a nonprofit newsgroup that focuses on women's issues.  \"I really, truly believe that when women are denied their basic rights anywhere, it gives heart to those who want to take away rights somewhere else,\" Clinton said in the interview.
