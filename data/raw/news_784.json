Some experts wonder if the state abortion ban might impact admissions(Ben Thorp/WBAA News)\r\n\tImmediately after the passage of Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban this month, many wondered about unforeseen consequences to health care and impacts on the state economy.\n\r\n\tBall State economist Michael Hicks, in an op-ed for the Star Press, suggested education was a significant sector that could also see ramifications from the new law \u2013 writing that there would be \u201cfar fewer out-of-state college students coming to Indiana.\u201d\n\r\n\t\u201cIt [the abortion ban] really hampers universities in their goal to bring people from around the world here to Indiana to study, to learn, to create new science and then to stay here to take jobs,\u201d Hicks told WFYI more recently.\n\r\n\tIndiana universities have largely stayed quiet about the new abortion restrictions. A spokesperson from the University of Notre Dame told WFYI that there was \u201cnothing to add.\u201d\n\r\n\tIn a statement, Purdue University said, \"it is the university\u2019s policy not to comment on social or political issues contended in the public arena.\u201d\n\r\n\tAnd Indiana University said it was \u201creviewing the new law to assess any potential impacts on our education or research missions.\u201d\n\r\n\tIt is likely too soon for the new law to create a measurable impact on college admissions. Hicks, in his op-ed, wrote that the impact wouldn\u2019t become visible until 2023.\n\r\n\tA spokesperson for the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers told WFYI that it didn\u2019t have any statistics on how abortion bans in certain states impacted student admissions, adding \u201cit\u2019s possible we\u2019ll have data on this topic in the future.\u201d\n\r\n\tPurdue students respond\n\r\n\tOn the ground at universities, some students say it\u2019s hard to know whether the ban would have changed their decision to attend Indiana schools \u2013 but it is likely to shape their decision to stay.\n\r\n\tHaley Archer is a Purdue sophomore from Warsaw, Indiana who said she is \u201ccompletely\u201d pro-abortion rights.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt definitely doesn\u2019t make me want to stay in Indiana after I graduate, but I\u2019m here now,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tArcher said as an in-state student, she likely would have stayed here to get in-state tuition \u2013 regardless of whether the ban had already been in place.\n\r\n\t\u201cPurdue was always it for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019d feel more comfortable because we have Illinois and Michigan around us if I were ever in that spot. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever get an abortion myself, but I definitely support those who choose to do that\u2026 but it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\r\n\tArcher said it\u2019s clear to her that Purdue leadership is going to stay away from commenting on the legislature\u2019s abortion ban.\n\r\n\t\u201cObviously I\u2019d hope they\u2019d be pro-choice, but with Mitch Daniels as president that\u2019s probably not the case,\u201d she said. \u201cSo them staying out of it and not saying anything is probably what I\u2019d prefer\u2026 They\u2019re never going to say their actual opinion.\u201d\n\r\n\tInternational students also say the decision to come to Indiana is a complicated one.\n\r\n\tNess Mehta is a second-year doctoral student in counseling psychology and an international student from India. She said as an international student, it took her a while to understand that the law would impact her.\n\r\n\t\u201cThe thing that I\u2019m kind of mad about is that on our tax forms I\u2019m a non-resident alien, but when it comes to abortion \u2013 when it comes to the laws \u2013 I\u2019m a resident,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a couple of weeks to be able to process it, because one of the reasons I came to the U.S. is that it\u2019s the land of the free\u2026 but I can\u2019t say that anymore.\u201d\n\r\n\tMehta said the new law is especially concerning to her because it impacts her area of study.\n\r\n\t\u201cWhat would happen if a client were to disclose in therapy that they had an abortion? What would a therapist do with this new law?\u201d She asked.\n\r\n\tAccording to Mehta, she didn\u2019t have a lot of choices about where she could attend school, which means she likely would have attended Purdue even with a ban in place.\n\r\n\t\u201cBut I can say after coming here, people ask me \u2018Are you going to stay in the U.S. after your program is over or not?\u2019 This decision has changed my answer,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind the U.S. before \u2013 I was like, it\u2019s alright, there\u2019s some stuff but I can live with it,\u201d Mehta added. \u201cBut I can\u2019t live with losing my bodily autonomy.\u201d\n\r\n\tIn a statement, Purdue Student Government Press Secretary Evan Chrise told WFYI \u201cwe are watching the situation very closely and want to support all students at Purdue University.\u201d\n\r\n\tChrise added that when it comes to the new abortion law impacting admissions, \u201cwe have not seen any indication of this happening.\u201d\n\r\n\tIU student government: 'parents are calling very pissed off'\n\r\n\tIndiana University Student Government has taken stronger steps to support students following the state\u2019s passage of the near-total abortion ban.\n\nEarlier this month, IUSG announced it would cover the cost of emergency contraceptives for all IU-Bloomington students through the 2022-2023 school year.\n\r\n\tStudents will be able to pick up Plan B at the Student Health Center free of charge.\n\r\n\tStudent body president Kyle Seibert and vice president Bell Pastore said they\u2019ve been hearing from students worried about how the new law will impact them.\n\r\n\t\u201cI know people that don\u2019t want to stay here because of it,\u201d Pastore said. \u201cI know students that come from out of state, and you kind of have these thoughts like racing in the back of your head \u2013 \u2018did I make a good decision and can I be safe going to this school?\u2019\u201d\n\r\n\tPastore said as an in-state student she might have looked elsewhere if the ban had passed while she was in high school.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty real thought that I would have to look at other places as well and take that into consideration,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like a lot of high schoolers now are having to talk about that, and people out of state, because we do have great schools here\u2026 but coming here I do think it [the abortion ban] really does put a dent in it for many, many people.\u201d\n\r\n\tAs members of student government, Seibert said they are hearing concerns about the abortion ban not just from students but parents as well.\n\r\n\t\u201cParents are calling very pissed off, very angry, saying \u2018What are we doing about this? My kid can\u2019t go here, I don\u2019t want my kid to feel like they can\u2019t make a mistake in the state without being punished in that way,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI hear that all the time \u2013 that it\u2019s really an issue where people are regretting their choice of coming to the state of Indiana because of this.\u201d\n\r\n\tBoth Pastore and Seibert said they are trying to focus on what they can do to help other students at this time.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s probably not reasonable to think I can wave a wand and re-establish Roe,\u201d Seibert said. \u201cDoing things like programs and providing emergency contraceptives to students\u2026 that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\r\n\tPastore, a public management and epidemiology major, said she\u2019s always thinking about public health and policy and has even thought about running for office in Indiana.\n\r\n\t\u201cLike I want to show someone that you can be in a very red state and hold true to what you believe in,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes with the legislature and the bills being passed\u2026 it can kind of make you feel like maybe I should go somewhere else. But then it\u2019s grounding to see other people who care about it here too. It makes you feel like it\u2019s worth fighting for.\u201d\n\nContact WBAA reporter Benjamin Thorp at bthorp@wfyi.org.
