(AP) \u2014 A judge on Friday put a temporary halt to South Carolina\u2019s new law banning most abortions around six weeks of pregnancy until the state Supreme Court can review the measure.\nThe ruling by Judge Clifton Newman came just about 24 hours after Gov. Henry McMaster signed the bill. The decision means South Carolina reverts back to a ban at about 20 weeks after fertilization.\n\u201cThe status quo should be maintained until the Supreme Court reviews its decision,\u201d Newman said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to end up there.\u201d\nWATCH: Indiana doctor reprimanded, fined $3,000 for talking publicly about Ohio 10-year-old\u2019s abortion\nThe law passed Tuesday by the General Assembly is similar to a ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected that lawmakers passed in 2021.\nThe state Supreme Court decided in a 3-2 ruling that the 2021 law violated the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy. Legislative leaders said the new law makes technical tweaks that should sway at least one justice to change his mind and the author of the January ruling has since retired.\nThe law took effect as soon as it was signed and Planned Parenthood immediately sued, saying it put South Carolina\u2019s abortion clinics into limbo with canceled appointments from patients further along in their pregnancies and doctors having to carefully review the new regulations.\nREAD MORE: North Carolina overrides governor\u2019s veto, bans abortion after 12 weeks\nThe abortion rights group said the new law was so similar to the old one that clinics and women seeking treatment would be harmed if it were allowed to stay in effect until a full court review.\nThe majority opinion in the state Supreme Court ruling striking down the 2021 law said that although lawmakers have the authority to protect life, the privacy clause in the state constitution ultimately gives women time to determine whether they want to get an abortion and most women don\u2019t know they are pregnant six weeks after conception.\nJustice Kaye Hearn wrote the opinion. She has since had to retire because she turned 72 and was replaced by a man, making the South Carolina\u2019s the only high court in the country without a woman on the bench.\nREAD MORE: Abortion bans fail in conservative South Carolina and Nebraska legislatures\nThe changes in the new law are directed at another justice in the majority, John Few, who wrote his own opinion saying the 2021 law was poorly written because legislators didn\u2019t show it did any work to determine if six weeks was enough time for a woman to know she was pregnant.\nFew suggested he would have found an even stricter full ban on abortion constitutional, saying that if a fetus had all the rights of a person, then a ban would be like child abuse or rape laws that don\u2019t violate privacy rights.\nThe new law includes exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies, the patient\u2019s life and health, and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. Doctors could face felony charges carrying up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\nREAD MORE: Support for abortion rights has grown in spite of bans and restrictions, poll shows\nMost Southern states have enacted stricter abortion laws in the past year and abortion opponents said that is why South Carolina has seen a sharp increase in the number of abortions performed and out-of-state patients.\nAbortion is banned or severely restricted in much of the South, including bans throughout pregnancy in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Georgia, it\u2019s allowed only in the first six weeks.\nMost abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy will be banned in North Carolina beginning July 1 after the state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature successfully overrode the Democratic governor\u2019s veto earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                FILE PHOTO: protesters inside the South Carolina House during another debate on abortion in 2022.
