(Pool photo by Steve Helber/Pool)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the last decade, Virginia has banned private plans on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange from covering abortions in all but narrow circumstances.\nBut in an almost entirely party-line vote on Friday, the state Senate passed a bill from Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, that would remove that prohibition in state code.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s one of the lingering barriers to abortion access in Virginia, which McClellan and other legislators have been on a push to roll back for years \u2014 with much more success since Democrats took control of both General Assembly chambers in 2019.\n\u201cThis is an issue that I\u2019ve been fighting on for a really long time,\u201d McClellan said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cAnd this is just the next step in protecting access to reproductive health here in Virginia.\u201d\nThe bill does not require insurance carriers on the exchange to offer abortion coverage. And federal subsidies that help cover the cost of the plans on the exchange are still prohibited from covering any abortion services that don\u2019t fall under the narrow constraints of the Hyde Amendment, which carves out exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or those that could endanger a patient\u2019s life.\nA fiscal impact statement from the Virginia State Corporation Commission noted that both the House and Senate bills would require the agency\u2019s Bureau of Insurance and Health Benefit Exchange \u201cto ensure that insurance carriers are billing, collecting and accounting for the portion of premium attributable to elective abortions for which federal funds cannot be used.\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t stop Republican senators from voting against the legislation on Friday (one Democratic senator, Joe Morrissey, also voted no.) Sen. Steve Newman, R-Bedford, said many weren\u2019t convinced that federal taxpayer money wouldn\u2019t go toward abortion services if the measure passed the chamber.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why you have a number of people that are concerned about the intent of the Hyde amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is basically, there are some of us who believe that on this very controversial item, no tax money should be used in this way.\u201d\nThe current prohibition on abortion coverage dates back to 2011, soon after the federal Affordable Care Act was passed under then-President Barack Obama. The ACA prohibited abortion coverage from being required as part of an essential benefits package. Obama also signed an executive order \u2014 still in effect today \u2014 that prohibited federal subsidies from being used to cover abortion beyond those allowed under the Hyde Amendment.\nMcClellan said the federal law also allowed states to impose stricter restrictions for plans under their own health care exchanges. The current prohibition in Virginia, proposed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, bans abortion coverage beyond the same narrow exceptions spelled out in the Hyde Amendment.\n\u201cIt is government overreach into private health insurance plans,\u201d said Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, who\u2019s sponsoring an identical bill in the House. \u201cBecause what the ban does is prohibit any private health insurer that does business on our state exchange from offering a plan including abortion coverage that any private patient could purchase.\u201d\u00a0\nThe prohibition currently applies to the roughly 240,000 Virginians enrolled in private plans on the state\u2019s health exchange (McClellan\u2019s office couldn\u2019t immediately provide a breakdown of how many of them are people who can become pregnant.)\u00a0\nAbortion is covered by many employer-provided plans, which aren\u2019t regulated under the Virginia marketplace. But McClellan said the prohibition on health insurance plans under the state exchange is especially detrimental to people who already struggle to afford basic health care.\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically saying to those people that they\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich disproportionately targets women of color and low-income women who can\u2019t pay it out of pocket.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHudson added it was especially important amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many Virginians have lost their jobs and employer-provided benefits. Out-of-pocket abortion services can be significant. According to Planned Parenthood, prices often start at $460 for the procedure alone. That doesn\u2019t include affiliated expenses, including sedation or the transportation and lost wage costs that many often shoulder.\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear how many insurance carriers would begin covering abortion services through Virginia\u2019s exchange if the prohibition was removed. In 2011, more than 80 percent of private plans across the country provided coverage, according to The New York Times. Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, said insurers typically didn\u2019t get involved in the issue (\u201cWe follow the law,\u201d he wrote in a Friday email.)\nBut McClellan said that 25 other states currently allow abortion coverage under their health exchanges, and insurance companies have stepped up to provide those services.\n\u201cI think the same providers that service those states will provide the same benefits here, as well,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe legislation must still be passed by the House and signed by Gov. Ralph Northam to take effect. Last year, Northam signed several bills that rolled back abortion restrictions, including measures from McClellan and House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, that repealed mandatory ultrasounds and a 24-hour waiting period before those services could be provided.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXVirginia Senate repeals ban on abortion coverage for plans offered through state exchange\nby Kate Masters, Virginia Mercury January 22, 2021\nVirginia Senate repeals ban on abortion coverage for plans offered through state exchange\nby Kate Masters, Virginia Mercury January 22, 2021\n For the last decade, Virginia has banned private plans on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange from covering abortions in all but narrow circumstances.\nBut in an almost entirely party-line vote on Friday, the state Senate passed a bill from Sen.
