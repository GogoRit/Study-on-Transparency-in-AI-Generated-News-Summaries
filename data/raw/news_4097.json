In 2017, she was legally recognized as a woman, and then fired. The grounds? That the Russian government had banned women from doing that job.\nRooted in 1970s Soviet propaganda that said women need \u201cprotection\u201d from dangerous jobs to preserve their fertility, a regulation passed by the\u00a0government\u00a0of President Vladimir Putin\u00a0in 2000 confirmed a prohibition on women working in 456 professions. These include train or truck drivers and auto mechanics.\nRussian women have fought the law, including in a 2012 landmark case, when a\u00a0woman who had studied\u00a0nautical navigation was accepted for a job as a riverboat captain, then rejected a few weeks later, referencing the ban on women in the profession. She had never heard of the regulation before and had invested in her education for this profession.\nRussian courts\u00a0fumbled the case, but in 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women\u00a0ruled in her favor,\u00a0rebuked\u00a0the Russian government for its baseless appeal to protecting women\u2019s fertility, and recommended reviewing and amending the list of banned professions.\nIn July 2019, following that lawsuit and UN appeal, and an\u00a0#alljobs4allwomen campaign\u00a0by leading human rights groups, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection announced that it had shortened the list to 100 \u201crestricted\u201d professions. The reduced list will come into effect in January. Starting next year, Russian women will be legally allowed to drive trains and trucks and fix cars.\nBut the\u00a0revised list\u00a0still says women are restricted from working in jobs in the \u201cchemical industry, metallurgy, oil production, coal mining, manufacturing of insulation, and some others owing to the harmful effects of certain compounds on women\u2019s reproductive health.\u201d\nAnna\u2019s recently concluded case illustrates the absurdity of the list, and the arbitrariness with which it is inflicted on Russian women. It also reduces women to their reproductive functions and perpetuates traditional gender roles and stereotypes.\nAnna began transitioning in 2015 and fought to align the name on her ID card with her gender identity, replacing the male name given to her at birth. A battle to change her gender marker on her ID ensued. But success in changing her legal gender in 2017 quickly led to her termination. Anna immediately filed a discrimination lawsuit, but lost.\n\u00a0With the help of Vyhod (\u201cComing Out\u201d), a Russian LGBT+ rights group, she appealed to a city court but lost again. In December 2018, the city court\u2019s presidium declared the earlier rulings void and sent Anna\u2019s case for a retrial.\nIn April 2019, she won, and the court ordered 10,000 rubles (US$144) in compensation for moral damages and 1.85 million rubles in compensation for forced absenteeism. In April 2020, her former employer\u2019s appeal was rejected and the compensation ruling upheld at last.\nMax Olenichev, legal adviser at Vyhod who helped on Anna\u2019s case, said the court\u2019s final decision was an important signal that transgender people in Russia could seek justice through the courts, but also sent a strong message about gender equality more broadly. \u201cEvery woman has the right to choose a profession,\u201d Olenichev said. \u201cThe absolute prohibition on such a choice, established in Russia by a list of professions prohibited for women, is a manifestation of discrimination.\u201d\nInstead of limiting women\u2019s access to employment, the Russian government should focus on ensuring that workplaces are safe and free of abuse and discrimination for everyone. Anna\u2019s employer never challenged her capacity to perform her job before she legally changed her gender. Then they used Russia\u2019s pernicious and discriminatory law to fire her.\nInstead of misusing the law to keep women out of certain professions, Russian authorities should focus their attention on gender based discrimination like the wage gaps women in Russia face\u00a0despite being, on average, better educated and healthier than men. Whether prohibiting women from doing 456 jobs, 100, or one, denying women equality in their choice of profession has no place in a legal system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia Russia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nLGBT Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 30, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nDozens Detained in Russia For Protesting Prosecution of Feminist Activist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 25, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nRussian Court Rules Transgender Woman\u2019s Firing Unlawful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cMy Teacher Said I Had a Disease\u201d\n\n\nBarriers to the Right to Education for LGBT Youth in Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2020\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cIf We Don\u2019t Get Services, We Will Die\u201d\n\n\nTanzania\u2019s Anti-LGBT Crackdown and the Right to Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 30, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nDozens Detained in Russia For Protesting Prosecution of Feminist Activist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 25, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nRussian Court Rules Transgender Woman\u2019s Firing Unlawful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
