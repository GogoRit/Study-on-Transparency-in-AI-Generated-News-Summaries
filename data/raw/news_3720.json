Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a bill on Tuesday that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy nationwide, the biggest step by Republicans to restrict abortion on a federal level since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The bill \u201cwould say after 15 weeks, no abortion on demand, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother,\u201d Graham said at a news conference. \u201cThat should be where America is at.\u201dThe legislation marks a reversal for Graham, who has repeatedly said overturning Roe would allow each state to decide its policy on abortion, and argued that would be the \u201cmost constitutionally sound\u201d way of dealing with abortion. On Tuesday, he said the new bill is meant to unify Republicans\u2019 position on abortion and described the legislation as a response to Democrats\u2019 failed efforts to re-establish national protections for abortion. \u201cAfter they introduced the bill to define who they are, I thought it\u2019d be nice to introduce a bill to define who we are,\u201d Graham said.Yet far from uniting Republicans around a shared position, Graham\u2019s bill, called the Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act, exposes fissures on the right over abortion policy post-Roe. It\u2019s an attempt to find a balance between the most conservative Republicans and activists who want to fully ban abortion and other conservatives who want to stick with more moderate limits. He announced the bill alongside Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and other prominent anti-abortion leaders, and called the measure \u201ceminently reasonable\u201d on Tuesday. But other anti-abortion groups, such as Students for Life of America, which has advocated for more strict laws including a national ban on abortion after six weeks, did not appear with Graham. \u201cThe 15-week protection measure is not our goal, but part of a journey,\u201d Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins said in a statement. \u201cThe Pro-Life Generation will not rest until even more lives can be saved from a tragic death even from the beginning of pregnancy.\u201d Many leaders at the event also indicated they would like to go further, with Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, describing Graham\u2019s bill as the \u201cbare minimum\u201d of what she would like to see.Read More: \u2018Never-Ending Nightmare.\u2019 An Ohio Woman Was Forced to Travel Out of State for an AbortionThe measure stands almost no chance of advancing while Democrats control Congress. Graham said Tuesday that if Republicans take back the House and the Senate in the midterms, he expects a vote on the 15-week abortion ban. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell indicated shortly after Graham\u2019s announcement that he might not want to bring the bill to a vote. \u201cI think most of the members of my conference prefer that this be dealt with at the state level,\u201d McConnell said.Democrats and abortion rights advocates take issue with the framing of a 15-week ban as a middle ground for conservatives. Reproductive rights advocates critiqued the bill\u2019s title for using the name \u201clate-term,\u201d a non-scientific phrase that has historically referred to abortions after at least 20 weeks of pregnancy. \u201c15 weeks is not \u2018late term,\u2019 particularly given the significant challenges to access around the country,\u201d Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications at Emily\u2019s List, wrote on Twitter. Most abortions happen before 15 weeks of pregnancy, and those that do happen beyond that point are often patients who learn they have fetal anomalies or other health problems, or those who did not know they were pregnant earlier.Strict abortion bans are generally not popular in the U.S. A recent Pew Research Center poll showed that 62% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, including 38% of Republicans. And a Wall Street Journal poll conducted near the end of August found that 57% of Americans opposed banning abortion after 15 weeks if the legislation had exceptions for health of the pregnant person but not rape or incest. Graham\u2019s bill contains exceptions for abortions \u201cnecessary to save the life of a pregnant woman,\u201d but does not include situations that endanger the pregnant person\u2019s health and does not allow exceptions for life-threatening \u201cpsychological or emotional conditions.\u201d It includes exceptions for rape and incest if the patient proves they obtained counseling or medical treatment for the rape at least 48 hours before the abortion or reported the incident to law enforcement. Physicians who violate the law could face five years in prison. The White House criticized the bill as \u201cwildly out of step with what Americans believe\u201d in a statement from press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Graham\u2019s proposal \u201ca radical bill to institute a nationwide restriction on abortions.\u201d \u201cFor the hard right, this has never been about states\u2019 rights. This has never been about letting Texas choose its own path while California takes another,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \u201cFor MAGA Republicans, this has always been about making abortion illegal everywhere.\u201d Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, about a third of states have completely banned abortion or severely restricted it, and many have enacted laws that have no exceptions for rape or incest. There have been signs of political backlash, as voters in Kansas soundly rejected a ballot initiative in August that would have amended the state\u2019s constitution to say it did not include a right to abortion.With measures like Graham\u2019s, abortion opponents hope they are \u201cmoving the Overton window\u201d of what Republicans are pitching to voters as moderate abortion bans, says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at University of California, Davis who focuses on abortion. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pretend that politics stopped existing when Dobbs came down.\u201dMore Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
