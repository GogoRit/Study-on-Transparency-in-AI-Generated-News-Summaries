Wade, the law of the land for nearly 50 years ago, giving women the constitutional right to have an abortion with some state-imposed limitations.\nThe newly conservative Supreme Court is set to rule on Mississippi's law this summer.\n\"If the Supreme Court backs 15-week ban, you can expect states across the nation to go to 15 weeks,\" said Zelden.\n\n\nZelden says Florida's decision to potentially impose a similar 15-week ban would not come without possible political consequences, especially for the governor himself.\n\"It could actually put pressure on DeSantis running for reelection, so it's a gamble,\" he said.\nDr. Zelden points out a 15-week abortion bill goes against the majority of voters in public opinion polls and could gin up support among angry Democrats.\n\"If people on the Democratic side feel they have lost rights they feel were established, the right for a woman to have an abortion, it could result in enormous energy flowing into the Democratic side,\" said Zelden.\nDr. Zelden said it would remain to be seen if that energy would translate into Democratic votes this pivotal election year.\nHe also points out most women don't even know they're pregnant at 15 weeks.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n New College of Florida to receive millions, some of the money includes strings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lawmakers sign off on expanding medical marijuana licenses for Black farmers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Facing South Florida for March 17: One-on-One with State Rep.
