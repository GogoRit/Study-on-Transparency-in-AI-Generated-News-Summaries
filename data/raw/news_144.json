Such attempts to co-opt the mantle of disability rights to ban abortion are not only hypocritical but also deeply offensive.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s be clear on what HB 214 does not do. It does not ensure that pregnant people are given information, resources, and support to raise their children \u2014 including children with Down syndrome (or any other disability) \u2014 with dignity.\nIt does not expand access to necessary services and opportunities or protect any person with disabilities from discrimination in education, housing, employment, medical care, or any other area of life.\nIt does not make it easier for people with disabilities to have \u2014 and keep \u2014 their children. And it does not protect people with disabilities from violence and abuse, such as coerced sexual and reproductive health decisions,\u00a0sterilization abuse, and\u00a0police\u00a0violence.\u00a0\nInstead, what HB 214 does, indeed, the only thing it does, is take away an individual\u2019s ability to make one of life\u2019s most deeply personal decisions and turn it over to politicians.\nThe hypocrisy is stunning: While Ohio politicians are passing abortion bans under the guise of disability rights,\u00a0Ohio\u00a0parents of\u00a0children\u00a0with\u00a0disabilities\u00a0are struggling to afford the services their children need to thrive. \nCuts in funding for these necessary services\u00a0are routine, and Ohio provides\u00a0significantly fewer resources\u00a0for people with disabilities than, for example, its neighbor Pennsylvania.\nAnd the government officials defending Ohio\u2019s ban in court? They are the same officials making it even more difficult for disabled Ohioans to\u00a0exercise their right to vote. The list goes on and on.\u00a0\nThere is no question that stigma, prejudice, and misconceptions about people with disabilities are widespread. But forcing someone to carry a pregnancy to term against their will does nothing to tackle underlying and systemic ableism and discrimination against people with disabilities.\nOn the contrary, forced pregnancy threatens a person\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional health, as well as the stability and wellbeing of their family, including existing children.\u00a0\nWe will never address discrimination and the needs of people with disabilities by stigmatizing people who have abortions. We cannot know all the personal circumstances behind an individual\u2019s decision to continue or end a pregnancy, including in cases of fetal diagnoses.\nThese decisions are often based on a multitude of factors \u2014 which is why the pregnant person and their family best make these decisions, and them alone.\u00a0\u00a0\nContrary to what anti-abortion politicians want you to believe, efforts to promote the rights of people with disabilities need not compromise other fundamental rights.\nIndeed, the disability and reproductive rights and justice movements share common goals: for every person to decide what happens to their own body and for every person to have the rights, resources, and respect to live their full potential. They also share a common foundation in the principles of equality, dignity, and self-determination.\u00a0\nFor years, we have seen politicians push medically unnecessary abortion restrictions in the name of women\u2019s health and use junk science to defend unconstitutional bans on abortion.\nNow, they are advancing their extreme anti-abortion agenda by claiming abortion bans are necessary to protect people with disabilities from discrimination. Enough is enough.\u00a0\nUnder no circumstances should politicians be allowed to force any individual to make particular decisions about reproduction, including forcing them to become a parent against their will, depriving them of the ability to become a parent, or interrogating their own decisions about pregnancy. That hurts all of us.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About the Issues on This Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Abortion                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Disability Rights                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            Reproductive Freedom                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                            State Abortion Legislation                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nACLU Names Zoe Brennan-Krohn as Director of the Disability Rights Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Press Release                            \nLawsuit Challenges Law Enforcement Response to Mental Health Emergencies in Washington County, Oregon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Court Case                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Court Case                            \nDisability Rights Oregon v.
