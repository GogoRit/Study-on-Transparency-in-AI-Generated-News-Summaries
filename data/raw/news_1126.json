Those statutes either banned abortion once this decision came down, required some sort of action from a state official certifying the supreme court\u2019s ruling, or stipulated that the ban would go into effect days or weeks afterward.\u2018It\u2019s important to fight\u2019: US cities erupt in protest as Roe v Wade fallsRead moreMissouri\u2019s legislation immediately went into effect. Six minutes after the supreme court decision came down, Missouri\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, certified this decision, and tweeted: \u201cFollowing the SCOTUS ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, Missouri has just become the first in the country to effectively end abortion with our AG opinion signed moments ago. This is a monumental day for the sanctity of life.\u201dThe Missouri law, which provides no exception for rape or incest, classifies the act of inducing an abortion as a class B felony, meaning it could result in a five- to 15-year prison sentence. It applies to abortion providers, though it\u2019s unclear whether someone could be prosecuted for using abortion-inducing medications, per the NPR station.In South Dakota, as of today, all abortions are against the law \u201cunless there is appropriate and reasonable medical judgment that performance of an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant female\u201d announced South Dakota\u2019s governor, Kristi Noem, with top state lawmakers.They added that they were planning a special legislative session \u201cto save lives and help mothers impacted by the decision\u201d.Kentucky\u2019s abortion prohibition \u2013 which permits the procedure solely to save a pregnant person\u2019s life or prevent debilitating injury \u2013 has also gone into effect, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. The state\u2019s trigger law similarly stated that the state\u2019s anti-abortion legislation \u201cshall become effective immediately\u201d.The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky reportedly said that the state\u2019s only full-time abortion clinic has stopped providing these procedures \u201cas a precaution\u201d. People seeking abortions will have few options within close proximity, as Illinois and Virginia are the only two of the seven states neighboring Kentucky that have mostly unrestricted reproductive health services.Louisiana\u2019s abortion went into effect after Roe was overturned. It bars most abortions and makes providing them illegal. The law does not provide any exceptions for rape or incest, no matter the age of the pregnant person, according to Nola.com.The law allows exceptions when there is an extreme risk of death or disability. At the same time, the statute requires that a doctor makes \u201creasonable\u201d efforts to save the fetus and mother, the site said. Legislators in the state have also ruled to criminalize mail or internet-based purchase of abortion pills.View image in fullscreenKendal Underwood, left, and Brittany Nickens protest Friday outside Planned Parenthood in St Louis, Missouri, where abortions are now illegal. Photograph: Jeff Roberson/APArkansas\u2019s abortion ban will go into effect as soon as the state\u2019s attorney certifies that Roe has been overturned. Almost all abortions are prohibited, except when a pregnant person faces a life-threatening medical emergency, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported.Mississippi\u2019s ban will go into effect \u201cwithin days\u201d and also requires the state attorney general\u2019s sign-off. In North Dakota, the abortion prohibition is enacted in 30 days after its legislative council greenlights the state attorney general\u2019s certification, the Washington Post said.Wyoming and Utah will see bans within 30 days once state authorities officially recognize the supreme court decision. Idaho\u2019s ban will go into effect in 30 days, as will Tennessee\u2019s, per the newspaper.Some states, including Arkansas and Missouri, had \u201ctrigger law\u201d bans on the books that went into effect as soon as Roe fell.In Alabama, the state\u2019s three abortion clinics stopped performing the procedure for fear providers would be prosecuted under a law dating to 1951.At the Alabama Women\u2019s Center for Reproductive Alternatives in Huntsville, the staff had to tell women in the waiting room Friday morning that they could not perform any more abortions that day. Some had come from as far away as Texas for an appointment.\u201cA lot of them just started breaking down crying. Can you imagine if you had driven 12 hours to receive this care in this state and you are not able to?\u201d clinic owner Dalton Johnson said. Patients were given a list of out-of-state places still doing abortions.Abortion providers across Arizona likewise stopped doing procedures while they try to determine if a law dating to pre-statehood days before 1912 means doctors and nurses will face prison time now.In Texas, providers wondered which law they had to follow: a 1925 ban, a 2021 law that limits abortions to the first six weeks of pregnancy, or a trigger law that bans the procedure outright, but wouldn\u2019t take effect for a month or more. The confusion led them to suspend abortions while they seek legal advice.In Texas the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, warned they could face immediate prosecution for performing abortions under the Prohibition-era ban, which carries a sentence of two to five years in prison.It was the risk of prosecution under a 19th-century abortion ban punishable by prison that led the Women\u2019s Health Center of West Virginia to stop performing the procedure.The West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said he will not hesitate to call the legislature into special session if the ban needs to be clarified.In Ohio, a federal judge dissolved an injunction, allowing a 2019 state law to take effect banning most abortions at the first detectable fetal heartbeat.Oklahoma, which has the most severe abortion ban in the US, also has a trigger law. Under this statute, providing an abortion is a felony, carrying a prison sentence of twoto five years, the Oklahoman reported.The Associated Press contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsRoe v WadeUS supreme courtLaw (US)AbortionnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
