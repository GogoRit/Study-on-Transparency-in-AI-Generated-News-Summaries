Wade is overturned by the US Supreme Court, 26 states are likely to restrict abortion, impacting more than 40 million women of child-bearing age, according to a report.\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based pro-choice research organization, reported last year that 22 states already have anti-abortion laws that would kick in as soon as Roe v. Wade falls.\nThose states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\u00a0\nNine states in this group have pre-Roe abortion restrictions still on the books; 13 states have a so-called \u201ctrigger ban\u201d that is tied to Roe being overturned; and five states have laws passed after Roe restricting nearly all abortions.\n\nAnother dozen states have six- or eight-week abortion restrictions that are not currently in effect, while one state \u2014 Texas \u2014 has a six-week abortion restriction in effect, and four states have constitutions that bar a right to abortion. \n\n\n12\n\nWith the Supreme Court apparently set to overturn Roe v. Wade, here\u2019s the likely status of abortion availability across the nation. \n\n\n12\n\nA crowd of protesters gathers outside the Supreme Court early Tuesday, May 3. AP\n\n\n12\n\nThe court\u2019s decision will impact more than 40 million women of child-bearing age. REUTERS\nAn additional four Republican-controlled states \u2014 Indiana, Montana, Nebraska and Florida \u2014 are poised to pass laws restricting abortion.  \nFlorida\u2019s 15-week abortion restriction will go into effect in July. The law makes no exceptions for cases of rape or incest, only to save the life of the mother.\nOn Monday, a leaked draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito signaled that the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide could be on the chopping block, Politico reported.\n\n\n12\n\nThe leaked decision was from Justice Samuel Alito. AP\n\n\n12\n\nPro-choice and anti-abortion activists rally in reaction to the leaked decision. Getty Images\nAs a result of the anticipated ruling, pregnant women could be forced to travel long distances to obtain legal abortion services in those states where the procedure will still be legal.\nIn the wake of the rare Supreme Court leak, lawmakers in several states are said to be laying to plans to enact even harsher measures to clamp down on abortions.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday that Republicans in Georgia were talking about having Gov. Brian Kemp call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly to impose restrictions that would go beyond the state\u2019s \u201cheartbeat bill.\u201d\n\n\n12\n\nA women cries while kneeling in front of the US Supreme Court on May 2. AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n12\n\nThe other conservative justices are expected to back Alito\u2019s decision. POOL/AFP via Getty Images\nThe controversial law, which was signed by Kemp in 2019, is currently on hold, after being struck down by a federal court in 2020.\u00a0\nIf Roe is defeated, Georgia\u2019s six-week ban would go into effect, and could be a precursor for even stricter anti-abortion measures, up to a complete ban on the procedure in the state.\n\u201cGeorgia is a state that values life at all stages,\u201d Kemp\u2019s spokesperson stated, according to 11Alive. \u201cGovernor Kemp led the fight to pass the strongest pro-life bill in the country and championed the law throughout a lengthy legal process. We look forward to the Court issuing its final ruling, however, this unprecedented breach of U.S Supreme Court protocol is deeply concerning.\u201d\n\n\n12\n\nProtesters react outside the US Supreme Court. REUTERS\nTexas could follow suit by outlawing all abortions in the state under its \u201ctrigger law\u201d that would take effect if Roe is overruled.\nIt\u2019s still unclear if the draft represents the conservative-controlled court\u2019s final word on Roe, given that it\u2019s not uncommon for opinions to change before a ruling is formally announced.\n\u201cRoe was egregiously wrong from the start,\u201d Alito, a member of the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority, writes in the 98-page opinion, marked \u201c1st Draft.\u201d\n\n\n12\n\nProtesters react to the leaked decision. AP\nThe opinion revolves around a case challenging Mississippi\u2019s restriction on abortion after 15 weeks, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nIf the nation\u2019s highest court decides that there is no constitutional right to abortion, it will allow Republican-controlled states to restrict or fully ban pregnancy termination.\nSince the passage of Roe v. Wade nearly 50 years ago, states have enacted more than 1,330 laws restricting access to abortion.\n\n\n12\n\nA pro-choice activist holds a sign reading \u201cAbortion is a Right.\u201d AFP via Getty Images\nIn September 2021, Texas adopted the nation\u2019s most drastic law restricting abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, even if it resulted from rape or incest.\nThe law allows private citizens to collect what critics call a $10,000 \u201cbounty\u201d if they successfully sue an abortion clinic or anyone who helps a patient get an abortion after six weeks.\nIn December, the Supreme Court decided to keep the law in place.\n\n\n12\n\nA pro-choice activist holds a sign reading \u201cBans Off Our Bodies.\u201d AFP via Getty Images\nEmboldened by the court\u2019s refusal to strike down Texas\u2019 law,\u00a0neighboring Oklahoma last week adopted a similar restriction on abortion\u00a0after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Critics of these \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d have pointed out that many women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant at six weeks.\nEarlier last month, Oklahoma lawmakers\u00a0voted to make performing abortions a felony\u00a0and imposed $100,000 fines and 10-year prison sentences on doctors who carried out the procedure.\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who once bragged that he was the nation\u2019s \u201cmost pro-life governor,\u201d has vowed to sign any anti-abortion legislation that crosses his desk.\n\n\n12\n\nPro-life and pro-choice activists gather outside the Supreme Court on May 2. AFP via Getty Images\nMeanwhile, 16 states and the District of Columbia have protected access to abortion in state law.\nCalifornia is considering measures to make itself an \u201cabortion sanctuary\u201d if Roe is defeated.\nThe Supreme Court\u00a0is expected to rule on the Mississippi case before its term ends in late June or early July.\nWith Post\u00a0wires\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\nabortion\n\n\nRoe v.
