He was represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.---About three years ago, I decided to sue my university. For many, that might seem an extreme measure, but for me, it was an easy choice, because it\u2019s outrageous to force students to pay for viewpoints they disagree with while denying them the right to present an opposing view.The trouble began when my student organization, Students for Life of California State University \u2013 San Marcos, decided to invite a pro-life speaker to campus. We believed that a pro-life view could be reasonably defended in a public university forum\u2014if given a fair hearing.For years, CSUSM has collected millions of dollars from students through a mandatory fee that goes to support its student government, Associated Students Inc. Those funds are used, in part, to underwrite student activities. If your club or organization wants to sponsor an activity, you can apply to ASI for a share of the money.Nothing is wrong with that, so long as the allocation is done fairly and evenly. No student organization\u2014liberal, conservative, or anything in between\u2014should be discriminated against simply because their beliefs are different from those of the people who run a university, oversee student activities, and make up the financial rules there.As it turned out, though, ASI didn\u2019t see things that way. They denied my club the funds we requested to bring in a pro-life speaker\u2014funds we ourselves had contributed to through the mandatory fee\u2014while at the same time funding pro-choice speakers with our money. As a result,\u00a0the university is now having to pay over $240,000\u00a0in damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.[RELATED: Pro-life group sues CSU for denying funds based on content]The federal court that heard my lawsuit, in which I was represented by attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom, determined that the university policies that set the stage for ASI\u2019s actions were unconstitutional. The court specifically referenced the unrecorded \u201cbackroom deliberations\u201d that led to ASI\u2019s decision to deny funds to Students for Life. Those deliberations, the court said, were made possible because of administrative policies that let student leaders fund, or refuse to fund, whichever viewpoints they wanted\u2014without even having to explain their decision.Despite this, the student government claimed in a memo to the entire student body that no evidence exists that they discriminated against our pro-life organization. In fact, the court held that, because of the backroom deliberations, it couldn\u2019t determine if there was direct discrimination. The court said that this lack of transparency and discretion to discriminate is exactly the sort of thing the First Amendment was created to prevent. The court did not in any way exonerate Associated Students Inc. or the university.The evidence is clear. The entire ASI budget was about $1.2 million (more now since they raised the fee). With only around $30,000 of that available for the more than 100 registered student organizations to draw on for their various activities, as well as to cover travel to academic conferences, there isn\u2019t much to go around\u2014unless you are a favored group.For example, about $300,000 that might have gone toward student activities was instead funneled into two student centers (established and funded by ASI), the LGBTQ Pride Center and Gender Equity Center. Both were established to advocate on behalf of underrepresented students facing discrimination on campus\u2014a laudable goal, as far as it goes.However, the centers also used their generous funding to put on events like the \u201cPleasure Party\u201d (an orgasm workshop involving sex toy giveaways) and \u201cKink 101\u201d (an interactive seminar with a guest speaker paid to talk on bondage, domination, and sadomasochism). One wonders why organizations established to advocate for underrepresented students are allowed to use resources in this way.CSUSM claims the settlement resulting from my lawsuit was a \u201cjoint agreement\u201d\u2014which is like saying the Treaty of Paris in 1783 was England\u2019s \u201cjoint agreement\u201d to recognize American Independence. What was jointly agreed was that Britain had lost the war.[RELATED: Pro-life group celebrates legal victory over \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 campus policy]Students forced to pay into a fund that supposedly benefits \u201cthe student body\u201d should\u2014as members of that body\u2014be able to use some of the funds they\u2019ve contributed to engage in the advocacy they deem important\u2026not just choose from whatever events and political agendas a few elitists will endorse. No social movement of consequence ever made history by being rammed down people\u2019s throats.No student\u2014whatever their beliefs\u2014should be denied the freedom to engage in advocacy on the issues that matter to them most. Which is why my settlement with CSUSM is a decision everyone can, and should, celebrate.Nathan Apodaca attended Cal State San Marcos, where he served as president of the on-campus Students for Life chapter.Follow Alliance Defending Freedom on Twitter:\u00a0@AllianceDefendsTagsOpinionpro-lifeShare this article Alliance Defending Freedom Alliance Defending FreedomView ProfileMore articles like this\n\n\nWhat you stand for is what defines youConservative students on college campuses are marginalized, threatened, and silenced by threatening students who oppose their views, or radicalized liberal professors or administrators. Campus Reform\u2014and readers like you\u2014are pushing back.
