(photo: EWTN/ENN)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nNation\nAugust 21, 2020\n\n\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 For the first time since 2000, the Democratic National Convention did not permit Democrats for Life of America (DFLA) to caucus as an official part of the convention and refused even to allow them to testify before the platform committee \u2014 the latest signs of the party\u2019s overt hostility to the pro-life movement within their ranks.\nAnd the exclusion of their life-affirming perspectives from party consideration severely dampened the enthusiasm Democrat pro-lifers otherwise might have experienced from the convention\u2019s formal nomination of Joe Biden, who became only the fourth Catholic major-party nominee in U.S. history.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much frustration, and people are so excited about coming out and speaking out,\u201d said Kristen Day, DFLA\u2019s president, speaking to the Register Aug. 17 following her group\u2019s virtual pro-life caucus held outside the DNC site earlier that day. \u201cThey want to vote for Biden, but Biden\u2019s giving us no reason to vote for him. \u2026 He\u2019s talking about late-term abortion, paying [for abortion] with taxpayer funds and codifying Roe.\u201d\nPro-life Democrats nonetheless made their voices heard protesting in Milwaukee against their exclusion; and, according to Day, the mounting hostility to these voters and their concerns has only increased their determination and numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, she called the momentum and growth among pro-life Democrats this year \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\nDay said that her movement consists of pro-life Democrats who also \u201cwant social justice, racial justice, economic justice,\u201d but who are disappointed by \u201cthe fact that we\u2019re being excluded and not even a small effort is made to ask for our vote.\u201d\nShe said this climate is \u201cthe most hostile\u201d it has ever been for pro-lifers in the party and referenced a 2017 meeting with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, where he remarked that \u201cwe welcome pro-life people in the party as long as they don\u2019t vote that way.\u201d\nDay said that Perez\u2019s \u201chostility is like a growth,\u201d pointing to a number of incidents since then, including the fundraising website ActBlue not permitting her group to raise money for pro-life Democratic Reps. Dan Lipinski of Illinois and Collin Peterson of Minnesota and the Democratic Attorneys General Association\u2019s litmus test against pro-life Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recalled DFLA\u2019s work with former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008, as part of his faith outreach group, and cheering at a debate \u201cwhen Obama started talking about reducing abortions\u201d because that was language her group had advocated. And while DFLA wants to end all abortion, \u201cif we\u2019re all working to make abortion rare, that\u2019s pretty good; that brings us back into the party.\u201d\nDay compared that to now, where the party has backed \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortions and late-term abortions, not even making any sort of argument against late-term abortions,\u201d saying that the party\u2019s abortion extremism \u201chas gone too far.\u201d\nDay also commented on criticism leveled by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., against former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican critic of President Donald Trump, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Ahead of his appearance, Ocasio-Cortez called Kasich an \u201canti-choice extremist\u201d who \u201cfights against women\u2019s rights,\u201d in response to Kasich\u2019s comments to Buzzfeed that her \u201coutsized publicity\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she \u201crepresents the party.\u201d\n\u201cI think she\u2019s very misinformed about the issue of abortion because abortion is detrimental to women. It\u2019s not empowering. Most women who seek abortion are poor; they feel like they have no choice,\u201d Day said. \u201cI think she needs a lesson about pro-life Democrats and what we stand for because we want to empower women; we want to tell women, \u2018Yes, you can.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also pointed out \u201cthe irony of a pro-life Republican speaking at the convention and there are no pro-life Democrats speaking,\u201d in reference to Kasich speaking at the convention.\nMore than 100 current and former pro-life Democratic lawmakers, including Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, Peterson and Lipinski, sent a letter to the DNC platform committee asking for the reintroduction of \u201cthe conscience language from 2000 into the 2020 platform, which acknowledges that Americans have differing and deeply held views on abortion\u201d and calling \u201cupon the Democratic Party to avoid divisive policies, such as passing a law in Congress defining a right to abortion (codifying Roe v. Wade) and introducing taxpayer-funded abortion (repealing the Hyde Amendment).\u201d\nThe 2020 platform draft states that Democrats \u201coppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women\u2019s reproductive health and rights, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment and protecting and codifying Roe v. Wade.\u201d It also targets the Helms Amendment\u2019s ban on taxpayer funding for abortion overseas. The Democratic lawmakers pointed out in the letter that recent Marist polling shows that 60% of Americans oppose taxpayer-funded abortion in the U.S., and 76% of Americans oppose taxpayer-funded abortion overseas.\nLipinski, an eight-term congressman who lost his primary this year after he was targeted by abortion groups, spoke from D.C. to those participating in Democrats for Life\u2019s virtual event Aug. 17. He said that he hoped his loss \u201cdoesn\u2019t deflate Democrats for Life, but really brings forth a new energy,\u201d because \u201cwe need to make the Democratic Party understand that they need pro-life Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe called the Democratic Party platform \u201cout of step with Democrats\u201d and highlighted a DFLA analysis finding that in 389 out of 435 congressional districts a majority of voters support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy as well as support the Hyde Amendment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moral imperative that we protect life, and we in the Democratic Party standing for pro-life for the whole life, we need to stand strong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many of us out there, although they want to ignore us or say that we don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nTerrisa Bukovinac, founder of Pro-Life San Francisco and a member of DFLA\u2019s board of directors, spoke at the DFLA event and participated in protests outside the convention leading up to the pro-life caucus. She told the Register that she became a vocal pro-life Democrat because her views have been left-leaning since high school but she increasingly took issue with her party\u2019s pro-abortion stance. \u201cI\u2019ve just realized that there is such a lack of voices coming from the left that are opposed to abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more that I\u2019ve looked into it, the more that I\u2019ve realized that we are actually the majority. \u2026 That has really given me the motivation that I needed to stand out and be someone who is taking a position that appears to be unpopular in order to give people the courage to also stand beside me and ultimately put the necessary pressure on our party to change.\u201d Bukovinac said that it\u2019s \u201cdisappointing\u201d that \u201cthis is the first year that we\u2019ve been kicked out of being allowed to caucus as part of the Democratic National Convention.\u201d She added that the \u201cmove has put a fire under a lot of pro-life Democrats.\u201d\n\u201cBiden has completely betrayed pro-life Democrats,\u201d she said, as \u201che championed the life cause years ago, and many of the people that supported him then would not be in a position to support him now.\u201d She believes he \u201ccaved to the pressure of just a handful of activists on the left that absolutely do not understand the implications of what they\u2019re saying.\u201d Giving the example of the Hyde Amendment, she said that \u201cat least 2 million lives have been saved by the Hyde Amendment, disproportionately Black, brown and indigenous children of color,\u201d and yet pro-abortion activists in the party \u201care trying to make it seem like the Hyde Amendment is somehow discriminatory.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBukovinac said that, for her, \u201cvoting for pro-choice candidates or any candidate that\u2019s going to massively violate fundamental rights, a vote for those candidates is complicity in those acts that we must not be enabling in any way.\u201d\nIn her work with pro-life Democrats over the years, Bukovinac has observed \u201ca generational gap in how left-leaning people view the abortion issue\u201d and noted that among those who are pro-life Democrats \u201cthe boomer generation generally is a little bit more on the moderate side and a little bit more on the Christian side, but younger Democrats tend to be much more progressive, more along the Democratic socialist lines \u2014 and yet just as anti-abortion, if not more.\u201d\nOne of these younger pro-life Democrats, TJ Burgess, also came out to Milwaukee to protest the party\u2019s exclusion of pro-life Democrats. He is a freshman at Louisiana State University, a founder of National Men for Life, and a DFLA intern.\nHe told the Register that a lot of his beliefs were \u201cin line with liberalism and the Democratic Party\u201d with the exception of the abortion issue. Burgess is a baptized Catholic but described his pro-life stance as \u201cvery secular\u201d and stemming from his view that abortion is a \u201chuman-rights violation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy generation is much more secularized,\u201d Burgess observed. \u201cWithin the last 10 years, more young, diverse and secular people are rising up in the pro-life movement, and there\u2019s people like me that see these figureheads and are like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s somebody like me that I can align with, and they\u2019re in the pro-life movement,\u2019 [and] they feel more welcome.\u201d\nHe founded National Men for Life in 2018 because he believed that the pro-life movement can both \u201cinclude men in the movement\u201d and \u201cshow how diverse it is.\u201d He cited research he came across when founding the organization that found nearly one-third of abortions are performed on women because of partner-related reasons, showing the significant influence men can have in the process. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely vital for men to be active in the family and active within the pro-life movement, so that\u2019s what my organization seeks to do: to get men activated and inspired,\u201d he said, \u201cget them involved and show them that they are not alone \u2026 that it really is just standing up for human rights.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBurgess said he thought there was \u201chope within the Democratic Party, now more than ever,\u201d and observed that Democrats for Life of America\u2019s social media has been \u201cblowing up\u201d recently and that the group is increasing their outreach to younger pro-life Democrats, as well. In January, a Marist poll conducted by the Knights of Columbus found that 44% of Democrats said they would be \u201cmore likely to vote for\u201d candidates who would limit abortion to at most the first trimester.\nAnd while they were largely shut out of the Democratic National Convention, given this depth of party support pro-life Democratic activists promise they will continue to be vocal.\n\n\n\n\n\nDay said that a January exchange she had with former South Bend mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg in which he would not acknowledge that the party had room for pro-life Democrats served as a \u201chuge moment of awakening\u201d for pro-life Democrats. And that exchange, paired with Lipinski\u2019s loss, where Democratic Party leadership was \u201cnot protecting the incumbent like they normally do,\u201d has caused pro-lifers in the party to realize that \u201cif we stay silent any longer, we\u2019re going to be gone \u2014 and we cannot let that happen.\u201d\nNow, Day added, she is \u201cseeing so many more people willing to speak out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\nKeywords: \ndemocratic national convention\ndemocrats for life\nlauretta brown\npro-life democrats\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 Things Catholics Should Know About Kamala Harris\n\nAs vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris takes the stage tonight at the Democratic National Convention, a look at some of the issues she has championed throughout her career. \n\n\nAlyssa Murphy\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-Lifers Rally at Democratic National Convention: \u2018We Will Not Be Ignored\u2019\n\nFaith leaders and Democratic public officials have been asking the party to have a say in the drafting of the platform, or at least for the party to moderate its pro-abortion platform.\n\n\nMATT HADRO/CNA/EWTN NEWS\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFr.
