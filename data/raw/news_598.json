One banner in Rzeszow stated that an \"abortion ban is discrimination against the poorest,\" because poorer women will not be able to travel abroad for abortions, as Polish women who can afford to already do.\"I wanted to have more children; you killed this desire,\" read a banner held by one woman among the demonstrators in Warsaw.Some Polish women said that if they are denied the right to terminate pregnancies in cases of serious fetal deformaties, they would not try to have children at all.Poland's top human rights official denounced the further restriction of what was already one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, calling it a tragedy for women.\"The state wants to further limit their rights, risk their lives\u00a0and condemn them to torture,\" said Adam Bodnar, the human rights commissioner, or ombudsman, whose role is independent from the Polish government. \"This offensive is opposed by civil society.\"The only remaining legal justifications for abortion under Polish law are if the woman's life or health is at risk, or if a pregnancy results from a crime like rape or incest.\u00a0To date, about 98 per cent\u00a0of all legal abortions in the country \u2014 of which there were 1,110 in 2019 \u2014 were performed on the grounds of fetal malformations.Poland's constitutional court on Wednesday issued a justification of a controversial October ruling that bans abortions in cases of fetuses with congenital defects, even ones so severe that there is no chance of survival upon birth.The government then published the court's ruling in a government journal. Those steps were the formal prerequisites required for the new law to enter into force.Forget Brexit \u2014 the EU is trying to put out a fire in the eastAnalysisPoland's proposed ban on abortion part of broader push to turn back historyReproductive rights activists say many hospitals had already started cancelling procedures that until Wednesday were theoretically still legal, fearing possible repercussions.Members of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party, which is aligned with the Roman Catholic Church, had\u00a0sought the new restriction. They argued that it was a way to prevent the abortion of fetuses with Down syndrome, which have made up a significant share of the legal abortions in Poland.Women's rights activists consider the new law to be draconian.'A terrible day for women and girls in Poland'The protesters are demanding a full liberalization of the abortion law and the resignation of the government,\u00a0neither of which seem likely in the short term.In the meantime, women's rights groups are seeking new strategies to help women. The Federation for Women and Family planning says it will seek redress in international courts, arguing that the new law violates prohibitions of cruel treatment and torture. It is also assisting women who want to obtain abortion pills or travel abroad for the procedure.Some protesters on Wednesday covered their faces with green handkerchiefs, which are the symbol of the abortion rights movement in Argentina. The South American country recently legalized abortion, a historic change in deeply Catholic Latin America.A constitutional court ruling in Poland in October determined that abortions are only legal in cases of rape and incest, and when the mother's life is in danger. But the decision had not yet been officially published until now, three months after the ruling sparked widespread protests. (Omar Marques/Getty Images)Amnesty International, which called Poland's law taking effect \"a terrible day for women and girls in Poland,\" said bans never prevent abortions.\"Instead, they serve only to damage women's health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to travel to foreign countries to access abortion care they need and to which they have a right,\" said Amnesty senior research adviser Esther Major.Poland's ruling conservatives have long sought to further restrict abortion rights. Past attempts by parliament to do so triggered mass street protests, pressure that led lawmakers to shelve those plans.In a more than 200-page ruling, the constitutional court argued that allowing abortion when there are congenital defects is unconstitutional, because the Polish constitution protects human life. The constitutional court is made up mostly of Law and Justice appointees who ruled on a motion brought by lawmakers from the party.The government appears to have calculated that it could change the law with less of a backlash by getting a court under its political control to do the job during the pandemic. Instead, massive numbers of people have in past months defied\u00a0pandemic restrictions in order to demonstrate.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Forget Brexit \u2014 the EU is trying to put out a fire in the eastAnalysis Poland's proposed ban on abortion part of broader push to turn back historyFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
