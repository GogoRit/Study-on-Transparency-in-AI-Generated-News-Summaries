The Arizona Court of Appeals has given us the clarity that Planned Parenthood Arizona has been seeking for months: when provided by licensed physicians in compliance with Arizona\u2019s other laws and regulations, abortion through 15 weeks will remain legal,\" Planned Parenthood Arizona CEO Brittany Fonteno said in a statement Friday.At issue in the appeal were two abortion laws passed 158 years apart that appeared to be in conflict.Outgoing Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich wanted to uphold a 19th-century, Civil War-era near-total ban on abortion. He filed a motion in Pima County Superior Court in July to allow for that law to be enforceable.But a law passed by the Arizona Legislature that took effect in late September bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation \"absent a medical emergency\" with no exceptions for rape or incest. Physicians who violate the 15-week law face a class six felony under Arizona law.Before the ban on abortions after 15 weeks, abortions had been legal in Arizona up until viability, typically 23 weeks or 24 weeks.After Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson on Sept. 23 decided to side with Brnovich and reinstated the 19th-century law, the appellate court put the law on hold pending the outcome of Planned Parenthood Arizona's appeal of Johnson's decision. Planned Parenthood argued to the appeals court that \"Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize the state's\" abortion laws.The appellate judges did not throw out the 19th-century law but instead found that the 19th-century statute and the 15-week law are not in conflict. Rather, they \"can be reconciled such that physicians are permitted to perform abortions in compliance\" with the 15-week law and not be prosecuted under the territorial-era law, the ruling said.\u201cWe are relieved for all of Arizona that the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood and ouroffice,\u201d Pima County Attorney Laura Conover said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe ruling prevents an effort to go back to a mid-19th century, near-total ban that would not end the need for or choice of abortion. It would have only made it far less safe for those seeking medical procedures.\u201dConover's office had sided with Planned Parenthood in the Pima County Superior Court case.\u201cWhat a dramatic 11th-hour turnabout for reproductive health,\u201d Conover's statement said.Brnovich's office did not issue a statement after the ruling and could not be reached for comment. Attorneys from the Scottsdale-based Alliance Defending Freedom, who represent parties supporting Brnovich's position in the case, including Choices Pregnancy Center, could not be reached for comment.Cathi Herrod, president of the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, issued a statement Friday that predicted the case would end up with the Arizona Supreme Court. The Center for Arizona Policy was not a party in the case.\"The fight to protect unborn life and women from the harms of abortion does not end with an Arizona Court of Appeals ruling,\" Herrod's statement said. \"I am confident Arizona\u2019s pre-Roe\u00a0law limiting abortion to cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk will be upheld by Arizona\u2019s Supreme Court.\"Incoming attorney general vows not to support 1864 lawThe 19th-century law has been a target of newly elected Democrats. Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs called the law \"draconian\" in her victory speech, and Kris Mayes, who narrowly beat her Republican opponent to become Arizona's next attorney general, has vowed not to enforce the old law.\"I will withdraw the attorney general's current support for that law when I take office,\" Mayes told The Arizona Republic in November.Katie Hobbs, Kris Mayes speak about ruling to ban abortions in ArizonaKatie Hobbs and Kris Mayes speak about a Pima County judge's ruling that Arizona would return to banning abortions in most circumstances.Alex Gould, Arizona RepublicMayes on Friday issued a statement that said she agrees with the Arizona Court of Appeals ruling \"that doctors cannot be prosecuted under an 1864 law for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.\"The question of whether the 1864 near-total abortion ban violates the privacy clause of the Arizona Constitution \"was neither argued nor considered by the Court of Appeals,\" her statement said. \"That will be a question for another day. As your next Attorney General, I vow to continue to fight for reproductive freedom.\"The territorial-era law had been dormant since a Pima County judge issued an injunction against its enforcement following the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. But the old law returned to relevance in June when the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling that protected an individual's right to choose an abortion.Fear of prosecution under the old law, which mandates two to five years in prison for abortion providers, had\u00a0halted nearly all abortion services in Arizona for part of the summer and also briefly during the fall.Amid the confusion and chilling effect resulting from the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, Planned Parenthood Arizona, the largest abortion provider in the state, had paused abortion care for most of the summer and at some of its clinics through Oct. 27, when the organization announced it would resume abortion care statewide.Planned Parenthood Federation of America president and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson released a statement calling Friday's court decision \"a monumental victory.\"\u201cThere is no doubt that there will be more anti-abortion attacks in the coming months and years, but for now, the cruel and antiquated near-total abortion ban will not block Arizonans from maintaining control over their bodies, health care decisions, and futures,\u201d McGill Johnson said.Ongoing uncertainty about the two abortion laws prompted\u00a0the Arizona Medical Association and Dr. Paul Isaacson, a Phoenix abortion provider, to file a lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court in October independent of Planned Parenthood's court maneuvers in the Pima County case. Isaacson and the Arizona Medical Association are backed by a legal team including Perkins Coie LLP, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona.Like Planned Parenthood in the Pima County case, Isaacson and the association argued in their lawsuit that the courts must \"harmonize\" all of the state's laws on abortion. Those include the 1864 law but also newer laws passed in the post-Roe v. Wade era that regulate and seem to approve of abortion as a fully legal procedure.Pre-statehood law required up to 5 years in prison for abortion providersCrafted by the state's first territorial Legislature in 1864, the near-total ban on abortion requires two to five years in prison for anyone helping to provide an abortion that's not necessary to save a mother's life. A companion law that mandated a year in prison for a woman who gets an abortion was recently repealed.Anticipating that Roe v. Wade would fall, the Republican-dominated state Legislature in 2022 passed the 15-week ban on party lines. The law would not have been constitutional under Roe v. Wade, which allowed abortions under state guidelines in the second trimester. But lawmakers included a provision that expressly states the 15-week ban law does not repeal the 1864 law \"or any other applicable state law regulating or restricting abortion.\"Brnovich wanted the old law to work alongside the newer and less punitive 15-week law, with county prosecutors deciding which one would apply in each circumstance.During the Nov. 30 appellate court hearing, Planned Parenthood Federation of America lawyer Sarah MacDougall said that the court shouldn't simply allow county prosecutors to decide which laws are enforceable.Mike Catlett, deputy solicitor general and chief counsel of special litigation for the Attorney General's Office, told the judges the laws could work together just fine. If a doctor performed an abortion when the gestational age was 18 weeks, a prosecutor could decide whether to charge the offender under the 15-week law, which calls for felony charges and a loss of professional license, or the harsher law that requires prison time.But Judge Peter Eckerstrom, one of the three appeals court judges who heard the appeal, noted that if the pre-statehood law goes into effect, \"preposterous\" consequences are possible given other abortion laws on the books. For instance, the only abortions that would be performed legally would be to save the life of a mother, yet an Arizona law requires a woman preparing to get an abortion to be shown an ultrasound picture of the fetus.Arizona has nine licensed abortion clinics and about 1.6 million women of reproductive age. Beyond the 1864 law and the 15-week ban, the state has imposed various hurdles before a person seeking abortion care, including a mandatory counseling session, compulsory ultrasound and a 24-hour waiting period. Reproductive rights advocates also have said the abortion ban after 15 weeks is too restrictive.Republic reporter Ray Stern contributed to this report.Reach the reporter at\u00a0stephanie.innes@gannett.com\u00a0or 602-444-8369.
