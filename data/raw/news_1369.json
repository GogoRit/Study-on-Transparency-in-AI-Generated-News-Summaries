Now The Satanic Temple is also weighing in. The Salem, Massachusetts-based group, which doesn\u2019t believe in a literal Satan but describes itself as a \" non-theistic religious organization,\u201d sued Idaho in federal court late last week contending that the state\u2019s abortion bans infringe on the rights of members who may want to practice the temple\u2019s \u201cabortion ritual.\u201d \u201cOur members hold a sincere religious belief that they can and should have an abortion,\u201d in cases of unwanted pregnancies, W. James Mac Naughton, the attorney representing The Satanic Temple, said in a phone interview Wednesday. The organization filed similar lawsuits in Indiana last month and in Texas last year, and Mac Naughton said he wouldn\u2019t rule out filing additional lawsuits in other states.\n\nForcing people to abide by one religious belief \u2014 that life begins at conception \u2014 and denying them the right to practice a different one \u2014 that everyone has the right to control their own body \u2014 violates religious freedom, he said.\n\u201cAbortion is a tricky enough issue as it is, but it just gets all inextricably intertwined with religious beliefs,\u201d Mac Naughton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Satanic Temple, dubbed TST in the lawsuit, is separate from the Church of Satan, which was founded in the 1960s. Founded in 2013, the Satanic Temple advocates for secularism and considers Satan a literary figure who serves as a metaphor for defending personal sovereignty against religious authority. The Satanic Temple\u2019s religious tenets include beliefs that people should have control over their own bodies, that the freedoms of others should be respected, and that scientific facts shouldn\u2019t be distorted to fit personal beliefs. \n\nThe organization also has something it calls a \u201cSatanic abortion ritual,\u201d that includes the process of a person reminding themselves that their body is inviolate, undergoing the abortion and then reciting a personal affirmation. In the lawsuit, the organization says some of its members in Idaho are \u201cinvoluntarily pregnant women.\u201d Each woman has a property right to her own uterus, the organization said, and that right \u2014 including the ability to remove a \u201cprotected unborn child\u201d from the uterus \u2014 can\u2019t be legally taken by the state without compensation.The temple also contends that Idaho subjects involuntarily pregnant women to involuntary servitude by forcing them to provide an embryo or fetus with oxygen, nutrients, antibodies, body heat and other services, during gestation. Finally, the organization claims the state wrongly discriminates against many pregnant people by only allowing abortion for those who were subjected to rape or incest, and not allowing it for people who became pregnant accidentally. The Idaho Attorney General\u2019s spokesman Scott Graf declined to comment on the lawsuit because the office has a policy against commenting on pending litigation. \n\nAt least 21 states including Idaho, Indiana and Florida have enacted laws barring undo government interference in religious freedom, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The laws are not identical, but they frequently state that governments cannot interfere with an individual\u2019s ability to exercise religious freedom without a compelling government interest. When there is a compelling reason, the interference with the person\u2019s religious freedom must be carried out in the least restrictive way. Spiritual beliefs surrounding abortion and other reproductive health issues are often nuanced, however, even within individual religious groups. The ACLU also sued in Indiana last month, saying the abortion ban violates Jewish theological teachings as well as theology allowing abortions in some circumstances by Islamic, Episcopal, Unitarian Universalist and Pagan faiths.In June, a synagogue sued over Florida\u2019s law banning many abortions after 15 weeks\u2019 gestation, saying the law prohibits Jewish women from practicing their faith free of government intrusion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Rebecca Boone\n            \n\n                Rebecca is a correspondent based in Idaho.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
