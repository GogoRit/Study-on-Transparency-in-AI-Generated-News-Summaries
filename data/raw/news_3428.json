(KNOE) - State Senator Katrina Jackson has introduced a bill that would abolish the death penalty in Louisiana for crimes committed after August 1, 2021.Jackson says her pro-life views, along with the potential financial benefits, led her to draft the legislation.\u201cLife is truly the one thing that once you take it away from someone, you can\u2019t return it to them,\u201d Jackson explained.In 2014, Jackson, who represents seven Northeast Louisiana Parishes, wrote a controversial anti-abortion bill later struck down by the U.S Supreme Court. In this legislative session, Jackson says the sanctity of life will remain a focus.\u201cI\u2019m not only just supporting life regarding abortion,\u201d Jackson told KNOE. \u201cI have always said that I have supported life at every stage of life.\u201dJackson added the chances of someone being wrongfully convicted played a factor.\u201cThat is an issue for me to see us take someone\u2019s life and find out five to ten years from now, once we have taken their life, that they are innocent,\u201d acknowledged Jackson.Jackson adds that not only is eliminating capital punishment the moral thing to do, but the fiscally responsible move as well.\u201cWe not only pay for them to be in jail,\u201d Jackson explained. \u201cWe also pay for them to exhaust an extensive appeal, which pretty much most people on death row are passing away in jail.\u201dJackson says the state will save close to $10 million a year by eliminating the death penalty. She wants to use that money to chip away at Louisiana\u2019s education gap.\u201cSo that we can begin to do grants for literacy of two and three years old,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOpen up additional spots in pre-K three.\u201dJackson adds she is sensitive to the opinions of victims and says that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t take life in prison without parole off the books.\u201cIf somebody does something so heinous to you or your relatives, I still want the option of life without parole to be on the table,\u201d explained Jackson.Louisiana\u2019s last execution took place in 2010.Copyright 2022 KNOE.
