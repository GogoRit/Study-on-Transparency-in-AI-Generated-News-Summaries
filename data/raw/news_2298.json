The group\u2019s founder said she repeatedly met additional terms set forth by Fox and in the end was not given a suitable reason why the ad was rejected.\n\u201cWe are the survivors of choice. We are the faces of choice,\u201d abortion survivors say in the ad.\nThough he was disappointed, Presley said he wasn\u2019t surprised Fox Sports chose not to air the ad. He hopes the chatter that has followed the decision will still get the message into American homes, especially as pro-life people direct others to the various abortion survivor videos at\u00a0facesofchoice.org.\n\u201cOur prayer is that it still has an impact and it still shows people the truth of what abortion is,\u201d he said.\nWhen Presley\u2019s birth mother was two months pregnant and in South Korea, she had a curettage abortion, \u201cthe type of abortion where a doctor goes into a mother\u2019s womb and rips the baby apart and brings him out in pieces,\u201d Presley told the TEXAN.\nPresley\u2019s birth mother was sent home, but a few months later she realized the abortion \u201chad actually failed and I was still very much alive,\u201d he said. Presley was born in 1995 and placed in a foster home in South Korea. Randy and Kathy Presley of Norman, Okla., adopted Presley when he was 13 months old, and raised him along with nine other adopted and two biological children.\nPresley has a deformed arm, which is believed to have been caused by the type of abortion attempted. Throughout his childhood, he struggled secretly with low self-esteem, thinking he was less than others because of his deformity. \u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere in life,\u201d he said.\nWhen he was 13 years old, Presley\u2019s parents told him he had survived an abortion. Though he was grateful to know his story, the news sent him deeper into darkness.\n\u201cIt became apparent to me at that time that my life actually was worthless because the people who should have loved me the most thought my life was so \u2018unvaluable\u2019 they tried to take it,\u201d Presley said.\nAs a young teenager, Presley developed hatred toward anyone who was pro-choice, including abortion doctors, post-abortive women and Planned Parenthood workers. \u201cI thought they were the scum of the earth because it was people like them who made me the way I was, so broken,\u201d he said.\nAll the while, he continued projecting a good church kid fa\u00e7ade at Trinity Baptist Church in Norman, where his father was a worship pastor. The summer after his sophomore year of high school, God got Presley\u2019s attention at Falls Creek Baptist Conference Center in Oklahoma. The camp pastor that week talked about the Greek word\u00a0dunamis\u00a0and how God imparts in the believer the power to overcome the trials of the world.\n\u201cI remember thinking I didn\u2019t have that in my life,\u201d Presley said.\nHe accepted Christ as his Savior that week and started seeing changes in his outlook. He realized his value was not in what he did but in the fact that he was created in the image of a God who had a purpose for his life, he said.\n\u201cHe has proven his love to me by dying on a cross for the punishment of my sins when I was far from him,\u201d Presley said.\nAs God worked in his heart, Presley was convicted of a hatred toward his birth parents for the choices they made. Forgiven by God, Presley felt the least he could do was forgive his parents. \u201cI found forgiveness there,\u201d Presley said, \u201cand I found healing there.\u201d\nPresley graduated from Criswell College with a psychology degree in 2018, is married to Bethany and works as a student success manager at Criswell while serving as a youth pastor.\nHe lamented the 60 million lives lost to abortion in the United States since the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.\n\u201cWe live in a culture that tells women, \u2018If you want to get ahead in life, if you want to go anywhere in life, you have to take a life,'\u201d Presley said. \u201cWe live in a culture that tells men, \u2018Fulfill the passions of your flesh, and you are not held responsible for your actions.\u2019\n\u201cWe live in a world that applauds evil as seen by its support of the taking of the most innocent of human beings\u2019 lives. That\u2019s a culture of death.\u201d\nThe only light strong enough to overcome that kind of darkness, he said, is the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a follower of Christ, that light has been placed within you, and it is your calling and your duty to take that light into the world,\u201d Presley said, pointing to Matthew 5.\nPeople inspired by the ad\u2019s message can get involved in the pro-life movement by looking for crisis pregnancy centers in their cities where they can get involved or by joining pregnancy help or adoption support ministries in their local churches, Presley said.\n\u201cGet involved in those ways. If there aren\u2019t those ministries in your church, maybe God would call you to start those,\u201d he said. \u201cLove your neighbor in a tangible way so that as we speak for truth, as we affirm the value of human life, the world knows it by the way we value the lives of the born.\u201d\n Comments\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n Historic rural church building, empty for five years, houses new Missouri congregation\n Hedger to step aside as MBC multiplying churches director, begin ministry with Ridgecrest, Springfield\n U.S. Supreme Court Justice Alito sounds alarm after Christians denied jury duty in Missouri court\n First Baptist O\u2019Fallon offers missions training, trips\n Christian teacher in Kansas City fired for biblical convictions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEthics\nDefend the sanctity of life with compassion, convictionBenjamin Hawkins Missourians must remain vigilant in protecting the life of the unborn, since Planned Parenthood and other pro-abortion groups are working hard to bring a culture of death back to our state.
