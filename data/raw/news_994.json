SB 956 would also enshrine in the state constitution an existing law prohibiting public insurance coverage of abortion care. If approved by Pennsylvania voters, this amendment would pre-empt any state court from protecting abortion care. Without the protection of state courts, especially in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn federal protection of abortion rights, abortion access could be drastically restricted, criminalized, or banned entirely in Pennsylvania.\nCheck the bill's status here.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Sponsors    \n\n    Senator Judy Ward  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Session    \n\n    2021-2022  \n\n\n\n      Bill number    \n\nSB 956 \n\n\n\n      Position    \n\n    Oppose  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated IssuesReproductive Freedom\n\n\n\nDocumentspdfACLU-PA Opposition to SB 956 PN 1286 Senate 2022-06-06.pdf\npdfACLU-PA Opposition to SB 956 PN 1286 Senate Health and Human Services 2022-01-25.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.aclupa.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/aclu-pa_opposition_to_sb_956_pn_1286_senate_2022-06-06.pdf\n\n\n\n\n      Related content    \n\n\n \nSB 106 | Constitutional amendments to deny abortion rights, change...December 17, 2021\n\n \nHB 1500 | Abortion ban following fetal diagnosisMay 23, 2021\n\n \nHB 904 | Six week abortion banMay 23, 2021\n\n \nIt\u2019s time to end violence against sex workers.
