Most abortions do not take place in hospitals, and according to providers, they generally do not require extensive personal protective equipment, like the masks and gloves in short supply for doctors and nurses fighting COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 22, Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order barring any procedures that are not \u201cimmediately medically necessary,\u201d and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly declared that the order applies to any abortions not considered critical to protect the life or health of the parent. A group of abortion providers filed a lawsuit claiming that the order constituted a near-outright ban on abortions and was unconstitutional.\nAlready, hundreds of abortions have been canceled.\nA federal judge in Austin sided with the abortion providers, temporarily blocking the state\u2019s ban because it \u201cprevents Texas women from exercising what the Supreme Court has declared is their fundamental constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is viable,\u201d he wrote.\nBut the 5th Circuit said that judge, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, had erred because his order \u201c[bestowed] on abortion providers a blanket exemption from a generally-applicable emergency public health measure.\u201d\nDuncan said Yeakel was wrong to characterize Abbott\u2019s order as an outright ban on abortions.\n\u201cProperly understood,\u201d he wrote, the executive order is a \u201ctemporary postponement\u201d of many procedures, like colonoscopies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Texas bans abortions after 20 weeks, meaning prohibiting the procedure for any length of time leaves many patients unable to terminate their pregnancies at all. Abbott\u2019s order is set to expire April 21 but can be extended.\nThe case now heads back to federal court in Austin, where a hearing is scheduled next week. The 5th Circuit had already paused Yeakel\u2019s order blocking the ban, but Tuesday\u2019s opinion threw it out entirely.\nFurther litigation is all but guaranteed. States including Ohio, Oklahoma and Alabama have imposed bans similar to Texas\u2019, and similar lawsuits are playing out across the country.\nIn a statement, Dyana Limon-Mercado, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, pledged to continue fighting the state but did not say whether providers would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case or head back to federal district court.\n\"We have seen relentless attacks on reproductive health care, including abortion access, for more than two decades in Texas, but the governor\u2019s order is a new low,\" she said. \"How cruel and out of touch with reality do you have to be to exploit a global health pandemic to further your own political agenda?\u201d\nMeanwhile, Paxton cheered the ruling, thanking the court for its \"attention to the health and safety needs of Texans suffering from this medical crisis.\"\n\"Governor Abbott\u2019s order ensures that hospital beds remain available for Coronavirus patients and personal protective equipment reaches the hardworking medical professionals who need it the most during this crisis,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
