The NWHN also seeks to make clear that reproductive rights are immigrant rights.\nWhat Is a Hysterectomy?\nFirst, a bit of background on the procedure. A hysterectomy involves surgically removing a person\u2019s uterus; afterward, they cannot become pregnant.\u00a0\nHysterectomy is the second-most frequently performed surgical procedure among U.S. women of reproductive age. On average, about 600,000 hysterectomies are performed in the U.S. every year. One-third of all U.S. women will have a hysterectomy by age 60. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 3.2 percent of all women of reproductive age (15-44), and 10.6 percent of women aged 40-44 have had a hysterectomy. There are several reasons  women choose to have a hysterectomy, as shown in the table below.\u00a0\n\n\n\nReason for Hysterectomy (2011 \u2013 2015)\n\nPercentage of Women\u00a0(15-44 years old)\n\n\nMedical reasons (e.g., uterine fibroids, endometriosis, cancer)\n\n89.6%\n\n\nNo more children desired (a chosen family planning method)\n\n5.3%\n\n\nOther reasons (not detailed by CDC)\n\n1.7%\n\n\n\nA hysterectomy is deemed to be a \u201cmajor surgery\u201d by the Mayo Clinic and should be taken extremely seriously due to the risk of complications.\u00a0 In addition, it has significant outcomes that women should consider before having the procedure, including starting menopause early and an inability to become pregnant. Like any medical procedure, a hysterectomy should only be performed with the patient\u2019s informed consent.\u00a0\nSterilization Abuse in the U.S.\u00a0\nThroughout history, women in the U.S. have been subjected to efforts to control their fertility, including through abusive and non-consensual sterilization. The concept of \u201cinformed consent\u201d when they consent to a procedure is critical. According to the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint in 2020, coercive hysterectomies are being performed at the Ocilla ICE detention center.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is a long and extensive history of reproductive abuse of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) before the 20th century. As just one example, in the 19th century, the \u201cFather of Modern Gynecology,\u201d James Morion Sims, developed many reproductive health practices based on surgeries he conducted on enslaved Black women\u00a0without anesthesia. Today, people are starting to give credit for these medical advancements to the Black women who endured excruciating pain during Sims\u2019 surgeries. To this day, however, we only know the names of three women from Sims\u2019 records: Lucy, Anarcha, and Betsey.\u00a0\nSterilization abuse gained a false patina of scientific legitimacy during the height of the eugenics movement that began in the 1920s and continued well into the 1960s. During these decades, racism was fully integrated into U.S. public health, immigration, and segregation policies as eugenicists applied emerging theories of biology and genetics to human reproduction. White supremacists embraced eugenics and sought to \u201cimprove\u201d U.S. society by expanding white reproduction and limiting reproduction on the part of those deemed to be \u201cunfit.\u201d Sterilization was used to uphold white supremacy and limit the reproductive futures of BIPOC communities, as well as people with physical and/or mental health challenges. In the early 20th century, more than 60,000 people were sterilized in 32 states based on the \u201cscience\u201d of eugenics.\nState-sanctioned sterilizations peaked in the 1930s and 1940s but continued throughout the 20th century. In the 1960s and 1970s, federal programs started funding non-consensual sterilizations, which ultimately affected more than 100,000 BIPOC women. For example:\u00a0\n\nPoor and Black women in the South were so frequently victimized by non-consensual sterilizations that civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hammer coined the term \u201cMississippi Appendectomy\u201d to raise awareness about the experiences of women who, like her, went to hospitals for medical treatments and were sterilized without their consent.\u00a0\nFrom 1950-1966, Black women in North Carolina were sterilized at more than three times the rate of white women and more than 12 times the rate of white men.\u00a0\nIn 1965, the U.S. Public Health Service began providing family planning services to Native American and Indigenous families; by the 1970s, as many as 25 percent of Native American and Indigenous women of reproductive age had been sterilized.\u00a0\nPuerto Rican women were subjected to aggressive population control measures by the federal government, which promoted and conducted sterilization through coercive institutionalized pressure, such as door-to-door visits by health workers, financial subsidies for sterilization, and employer favoritism toward sterilized women. A 1965 survey found that about one-third of all Puerto Rican mothers aged 20 \u2013 49 had been sterilized. A 1968 study found that more than one-third of sterilized women did not fully understand that tubal ligation (a form of sterilization also called \u201ctying the tubes\u201d) was permanent; many of these women believed the procedure to be reversible and were not directly told otherwise by medical professionals.\u00a0\n\nCall for volunteers to speak out against sterilization abuse, printed in the NWHN\u2019s Network News newsletter, April/May 1979\n\u00a0\nThe NWHN Fights Back \nIn 1975, the newly formed National Women\u2019s Health Network testified at nationwide hearings on proposed federal sterilization guidelines. In support of safeguards proposed by Black and Latina activists, we called for a 30-day waiting period for procedures, a minimum age of 21 years old, detailed informed consent requirements, and a moratorium on government funding for the sterilization of institutionalized women and those deemed \u201cincompetent.\u201d\u00a0\nBy 1979, the NWHN was taking on the National Organization for Women (NOW), asking our members to speak at their local NOW chapter in response to its position on sterilization, which opposed any waiting period and disregarded what women of color (and poor white women) were experiencing. In March of that year, federal regulations went into effect restricting federal funds for sterilization until patients gave their voluntary and informed consent for the procedure.\nIn 1981, as part of its Sterilization Abuse Monitoring Project, the NWHN organized with member groups in New York City and elsewhere to develop an in-depth manual to help local groups monitor hospitals and clinics for cases of forced sterilization. This manual was a first-of-its-kind guide.\nThat same year, the NWHN sent a letter to OB/GYN departments at all major teaching hospitals in the U.S, asking for chairpersons to confirm in writing whether that hospital is complying with federal sterilization regulations and requested copies of each hospital\u2019s memo to staff explaining the regulations. One-third, or the 350, hospitals responded.\u00a0\nThe medical establishment intensely resisted these rules protecting against abuse, but they were ultimately implemented and, in many cases, remain in effect today. \u00a0But that doesn\u2019t mean that sterilization abuse was no longer a concern.\nThroughout this period and into the present day, our work has been profoundly shaped by NWHN charter member and long-time board member Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias, M.D., a leader in the fight against sterilization abuse in Puerto Rico, New York, and nationwide. Helen was a founding member of the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse (CESA), the first grassroots organization developed to combat forced sterilization.\u00a0 CESA, a multiethnic organization, was responsible for crafting protective guidelines and leading a multipronged campaign to demonstrate community support for government action to end abuse. Read more about Dr. Rodriguez-Trias and her work to end reproductive coercion HERE and HERE.\nSterilization Abuse Continued Where Women Weren\u2019t Free\u00a0\u00a0\nWomen who are incarcerated or otherwise detained by the state appear to be at highest risk these days. For example, a 2013 audit of state and federal prisons in California found that 144 tubal ligations had been performed on inmates and that 39 were performed without lawful consent. These data are, alarmingly, only from the time periods of 2005-2006 and 2012-2013, so the numbers are likely to be even higher.\u00a0\nThe most recent case of sterilization abuse comes from September 2020. A whistle-blower who works in an ICE detention center filed a complaint citing concerns about the apparently high number of hysterectomies being performed on immigrants who are detained at the facility. Since then, multiple women have come forward to share their firsthand accounts of having been subjected to sterilization, including a former detainee who says one of her fallopian tubes was removed without providing consent.\u00a0The NWHN strongly supports the congressional investigation into mass hysterectomies and medical neglect in ICE detention centers.\nThese are just a few of the myriad of stories and experiences of sterilization abuse suffered by marginalized peoples in the U.S.\nRegional (i.e., Europe, Africa, etc.) and international human rights courts are increasingly addressing forced sterilization as a human rights violation and highlighting how the practice disproportionately affects marginalized groups. Several treaty bodies include forced sterilization as a form of human rights abuse.\nFor example, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the world\u2019s primary document on women\u2019s equality, affirms women\u2019s reproductive rights. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has ruled that forced sterilization violates women\u2019s human rights. Among the members of the United Nations, only the U.S. Iran, Somalia, Sudan, and a few Small Island nations have yet to ratify CEDAW. However, we have several opportunities to address this problem.\nFirst, according to his Agenda for Women, President Biden will seek U.S. ratification of CEDAW. The Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee has debated ratification of CEDAW\u00a0several times, but the full Senate has\u00a0refused to\u00a0ratify it, in part due to\u00a0unfounded fears that CEDAW will increase abortion and prostitution and undermine U.S. sovereignty.\nSecond, Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Representative Adam Smith (D-WA), and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act of 2019 (H.R.2415/ S.1243). The Act condemns performance of unwanted and/or unnecessary medical procedures on individuals without their informed consent. It further recognizes the need for additional accountability, oversight, and transparency to protect individuals from these medical procedures while in ICE custody. Finally, the Act calls on the Department of Homeland Security to fully cooperate with investigations about, and take other actions related to, medical procedures in its detention centers. The NWHN will encourage and advocate for the Act (or similar legislation) to be introduced in the 117th Congress.\n2024 Update\nIn 2022, the 18-month bipartisan investigation ended, finding that allegations of mass hysterectomies were false. However, serious issues were found regarding medical procedures and policies at the Georgia facility and with Dr. Amin, the OB-GYN who performed the procedures. Medical records of 94 women were reviewed by OB-GYN Peter Cherouny, MD, who stated that Dr. Amin\u2019s care was \u201caggressive\u201d and practiced \u201cpretty good medicine for the 1980s, but we\u2019re not there anymore.\u201d While only two hysterectomies were performed from 2017 to 2019, Dr. Amin performed an unusually high number of other gynecological procedures on ICE detainees. The Irwin County detention center held 4% of women in ICE custody from 2017 to 2020, and Dr. Amin performed over 80% of gynecologic procedures during that time. ICE stopped referring patients to Dr. Amin\u2019s clinic after the whistleblower report, and in May 2021, the Biden administration ordered ICE to stop using the Irwin County facility to hold immigrants.\nConclusion\u00a0\nThe NWHN firmly believes that reproductive autonomy \u2014 the right to control when and whether to become pregnant, seek abortion care, and have a child \u2014 is a human right. According to an interagency statement published in 2014 by the\u00a0World Health Organization, \u201cSterilization without full, informed consent has been variously described by international, regional and national human rights bodies as an involuntary, coercive and/or forced practice, and as a violation of fundamental human rights, including the right to health, the right to information, the right to privacy, the right to decide on the number and spacing of children, the rights to found a family and the right to be free from discrimination\u2026Human rights bodies have also recognized that forced sterilization is a violation of the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\u201d.\nThe immigrant women in detention centers deserve autonomy over their bodies and reproductive choices, just like everyone else. This right does not depend upon a person\u2019s race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, creed, or immigration status.\nThe NWHN is also committed to ensuring that people have the most accurate information and high-quality health care to decide what is best for their bodies and their health. We strongly support access to all contraceptive options, including fully informed and consented hysterectomies and sterilizations, and we reject any effort to direct or coerce women into using any specific method. We caution providers, public health officials, and policy-makers against assuming one method is better or worse for any individual based on his or her race, ethnicity, age, ability, economic status, sexual orientation, or gender identity and expression. Read more about the NWHN\u2019s work on reproductive coercion, including our Statement of Principles on Long-Acting Reversible Contraception, coauthored with SisterSong and signed by hundreds of organizations and individuals.\nIt is essential that we continue fighting and advocating for the rights of all individuals, including those who are marginalized and oppressed. If you want to get involved, contact your member of Congress and express your support for a full investigation of sterilization abuses in detention facilities. You can also ask your member of Congress to support the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which supports immigrant rights.\u00a0\nGabriela Salas is the NWHN Policy Fellow\nAdditional Resources\nFit to Be Tied:\u00a0\u00a0Sterilization and Reproductive Rights in America 1950-1980 by Rebecca M. Kluchin, 2009, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey.\nLandmark court cases related to sterilization abuse:\n\nBuck v. Bell (1927): Carrie Buck, a poor white woman who was assumed to have inherited \u201cfeeblemindedness\u201d and \u201cpromiscuity\u201d from her institutionalized mother, was sterilized after giving birth to an \u201cillegitimate child\u201d. The suit, filed by Buck and her guardian, made it to the Supreme Court where the Virginia law, which allowed for individuals labeled as \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d to be sterilized, was upheld in the interest of \u201cpublic welfare.\u201d As a result of this case, thousands of Americans with mental illness or developmental disabilities were sterilized throughout the 20th century.\u00a0\nRelf v. Weinberger (1973): Mary Alice and Minnie Relf, poor Black sisters, were sterilized at the ages of 14 and 12 for being \u201cmentally disabled.\u201d Their illiterate mother had signed an \u201cX\u201d on a piece of paper that she believed had provided consent for the young women to receive birth control. The case exposed the wide-spread sterilization abuse that had been funded by the federal government for decades. The District Court found that an estimated 100,000 \u2013 150,000 low-income people had been sterilized annually under federally-funded programs. It also found that countless numbers were coerced into agreeing to be sterilized by doctors who threatened to terminate their welfare benefits unless they \u201cconsented\u201d to the procedures. The case resulted in the requirement that doctors obtain informed consent before performing sterilization procedures, prohibited the use of federal dollars for involuntary sterilizations, and prohibited the practice of threatening women with the loss of their benefits and welfare.\nMadrigal v. Quilligan (1975): Ten Mexican and Mexican-American women filed a lawsuit alleging that they had been systematically coerced by medical personnel to be sterilized while giving birth at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Seven out of the ten signed consent forms, the other three did not. All of the women who \u201cconsented\u201d were in labor; many said that they were told they could not be attended until they signed the consent form; some did not read English, and therefore had no way to understand of what they were signing, and at least one woman said that a nurse took her hand and signed an \u201cX\u201d for her. The women did not win their case but, because of this court case consent forms must be printed in both English and Spanish.\u00a0\n\nAdditional recent publications related to sterilization abuse in the U.S.\n\nUnion of Concerned Scientists \u2013 \u201cHysterectomies at an ICE Facility and the Complicity of Science in Reproductive Rights Violations\u201d\nNational Partnership for Women & Families \u2013 \u201cPast as Present: America\u2019s Sordid History of Medical Reproductive Abuse and Experimentation\u201d\n\nOrganizations that work on immigrant rights, including providing crucial legal aid:\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)\u00a0\nNational Immigrant Justice Center\u00a0\nInterfaith Community for Detained Immigrants\nImmigration Justice Campaign\nNational Coalition for Immigrant Women\u2019s Rights\n\nUpdated 2/13/2024 by Rachel Grimsley, RN, BSN, MSN, Nurse Writer\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tShare:\r\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Health Unlocked Episodes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n                040: A Sit- Down with Endometriosis Filmmaker Shannon Cohn\n            \n\n\t\t\t\tMarch 5, 2024\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Grimsley, (RN, BSN, MSN) Volunteer Health Officer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolicy Updates, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPress Releases\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n                Introducing the National Women\u2019s Health Network Policy Advisory Committee\n            \n\n\t\t\t\tFebruary 28, 2024\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNWHN Staff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThese health experts will spearhead research and policies related to health care access, biomedical research, and bodily autonomy for the NWHN.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolicy Updates, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPress Releases\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n                The National Women\u2019s Health Network Releases 2024 Policy Agenda\n            \n\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 24, 2024\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNWHN Staff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIts issue briefs, legislative actions, and policy recommendations are a road map to true health equity for women across the life continuum.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCampaigns, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolicy Updates\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n                The National Women\u2019s Health Network\u2019s 2024 Policy Agenda\n            \n\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 24, 2024\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBy:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthor Name\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNew ways to empower health care consumers across the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTell Your Story\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSign Up for our Newsletter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1413 K Street NW,\r\n4th Floor\r\nWashington, D.C. 20005\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail: \n[email\u00a0protected] \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(202) 682-2640\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFax: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(202) 682-2648\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for our Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 National Women's Health Network.
