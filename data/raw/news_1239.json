What to knowNews Sports Life Opinion Business Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals  NEWSWhat we know about Oklahoma's new abortion ban \u2014 the strictest in the nationDana Branham Carmen FormanOklahomanThe nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion ban is now in effect in Oklahoma.\u00a0Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday\u00a0signed House Bill 4327 into law, which bans abortions from the point of fertilization with limited exceptions.\u00a0The new law comes just weeks after the state enacted a six-week abortion ban modeled after one that took effect in Texas in 2021. But Oklahoma\u2019s law goes further than the restrictive anti-abortion law in Texas that was previously thought to be the strictest in the nation.\u00a0Related:Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signs nation's strictest abortion ban. It starts immediatelyProponents have touted the measure as a victory for the unborn. Abortion rights groups have said the law will be devastating for Oklahomans, and they plan to challenge the measure in court.\u00a0Here\u2019s what we know\u00a0about the new law.What does this mean for\u00a0abortion clinics?Because HB 4327 included an emergency clause, it took effect immediately upon the governor\u2019s signature.Abortion providers said they would stop offering the procedure, if they had not already, as soon as Stitt signed the bill into law.\u00a0Oklahoma\u2019s two Planned Parenthood clinics already had halted abortion services following a six-week ban that took effect earlier this month. Although the clinics were looking to resume abortions soon, that changed when the Oklahoma Legislature approved the more restrictive anti-abortion legislation.\u00a0Related:'It's horrible.' Uncertainty looms as Oklahoma clinic braces for Texas-style abortion banThe state\u2019s other two abortion providers, the Tulsa Women\u2019s Clinic and the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma City, said they would stop performing the procedure once Stitt signed HB 4327.Oklahomans seeking an abortion likely will have to travel out of state for the procedure.\u00a0How does this law differ from Oklahoma\u2019s\u00a0six-week abortion ban?\u00a0HB 4327 bans abortion after fertilization \u2014\u00a0so, any point during pregnancy \u2014 with limited exceptions.\u00a0Under Senate Bill\u00a01503, which went into effect earlier this month, abortions were still legal if they occurred before embryonic cardiac activity could be detected on an ultrasound, which is roughly the six-week mark of pregnancy.\u00a0SB 1503 provided an exception for later abortions in the event of a medical emergency but had no exception for cases of pregnancy caused by rape or incest.\u00a0Related:Oklahomans, Texans now comprise majority of patients at Kansas abortion clinic, doc saysThis\u00a0law bans most abortions after \u201cfertilization.\u201d What does that mean and when does it occur?Banning abortion after fertilization essentially prohibits\u00a0all abortions, because fertilization is the first step that leads to pregnancy.\u00a0Fertilization happens when a sperm cell and an egg cell join in the fallopian tubes to form a single cell called a zygote.\u00a0Over the next few days, the zygote will rapidly divide into multiple cells, and that cluster of cells will travel to the uterus, implant there and begin to grow. Pregnancy begins when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u00a0How will Oklahoma's new abortion law be enforced?\u00a0The law allows people to file civil actions against anyone, including a doctor, who helps a woman obtain an abortion at any point in her pregnancy.\u00a0Successful plaintiffs could be awarded at least $10,000 in damages.What exceptions does this law provide?\u00a0Under HB 4327, abortions are only legal under extremely limited circumstances: in the event of a medical emergency, or in the case of pregnancy caused by rape or incest, so long as the person seeking an abortion reported the crime to law enforcement.\u00a0The vast majority of rapes and sexual assaults go unreported.\u00a0With so many new anti-abortion laws taking effect in Oklahoma, which ones\u00a0matter?The abortion ban that begins at fertilization will supersede an earlier law that bans most abortions at about the sixth week of pregnancy.\u00a0Anti-abortion lawmakers say the near-total ban will work in tandem with a new law that classifies performing an abortion as a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison or up to $100,000 in fines.\u00a0Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat, R-Oklahoma City, who opposes abortion, said most of the state\u2019s anti-abortion laws will work \u201cin concert\u201d with one another. But it is unclear if\u00a0that will still be the case should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 spurring Oklahoma\u2019s trigger law to take effect.\u00a0Although HB 4327 includes limited exceptions for rape and incest, the state\u2019s trigger ban only allows for an exception to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency, which would seem to put the two measures in conflict with each other.\u00a0Who can be sued under Oklahoma's new abortion law? Who can\u2019t be sued?Any private citizen who performs an abortion or \u201cknowingly engages\u201d in conduct that \u201caids or abets\u201d a woman seeking an abortion in violation of this law could face a civil lawsuit. The law includes little detail about what counts as aiding or abetting, except to say that it includes paying for or reimbursing the costs of a woman\u2019s illegal abortionThe law is written in such a way that someone could be sued even if they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re breaking the law by helping a woman.\u00a0However, a woman who gets an\u00a0abortion could not be sued.\u00a0In what appears to be protections for taxi, Uber and Lyft drivers, the law stipulates a person who takes a pregnant woman to a provider cannot be sued if said person is unaware the woman intends to get an abortion.Someone could bring a lawsuit anytime in the six years following a woman\u2019s illegal abortion.Does this\u00a0law include medication abortions?Yes. Medication abortions, which are done by taking a series of pills over the course of a few days, are banned under HB 4327.Does this law outlaw Plan B?No. HB 4237 specifically says the law doesn\u2019t apply to emergency contraception, also referred to as Plan B or \u201cmorning after\u201d pills. So emergency contraception will remain legal under the law.Plan B isn\u2019t an abortifacient. The pills cannot terminate a pregnancy; they work by delaying ovulation, thereby preventing fertilization, or by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting.\u00a0The pills are meant to be taken within a few days after unprotected sex or after the failure of another birth control method to prevent pregnancy.Does this law outlaw birth control?\u00a0No. In addition to explicitly allowing for emergency contraception, the law says it does not ban any other type of contraception. So birth control methods like intrauterine devices, or IUDs, implants, condoms and birth control pills all remain legal.What about ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages?The law says any procedure to \u201cremove a dead unborn child\u201d as a result of a miscarriage, or removing an ectopic pregnancy, is not considered an abortion and wouldn\u2019t be prohibited under the measure.\u00a0An ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening situation that happens when a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus. Most occur in the fallopian tube, which can rupture as the pregnancy grows and cause internal bleeding.\u00a0An ectopic pregnancy can\u2019t be moved to the uterus and will never be viable, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.oklahoman.com.
