(Courtesy BCN Productions)An afternoon in North Easton\u2019s Borderland State Park might include a woodsy hike, a paddle on one of six ponds, or a tour of the mansion that served as the centerpiece for 2019\u2019s hit murder mystery, \u201cKnives Out.\u201dYet until recently, many of the astonishing accomplishments of the estate\u2019s architect and former matriarch, Blanche Ames Ames, were left to the archives.It turns out Ames was a pivotal strategist for women\u2019s suffrage, an effective political cartoonist, a foremother of the women\u2019s reproductive rights movement, an inventor, gifted painter and illustrator, and so much more.In a new documentary set to premiere at Stonehill College on Saturday, one of her granddaughters remarks that Ames conveyed mastery and authority in everything she undertook. Yet her 1969 New York Times obituary headline obscures her prominence, reading \u201cMrs. Oakes Ames Botanist\u2019s Widow\u201d with the subhead, \u201cIllustrator of Her Husband\u2019s Works on Orchids Dies.\u201dTwo years ago one of Ames\u2019 relatives approached documentary filmmaker Kevin Friend to consider making a film about Borderland. Friend grew up in Sharon and lives in Easton. He\u2019d been aware of the park his whole life, however, he says, \u201cWhat I was not aware of was Blanche.\u201d Friend says at first he envisioned a story in equal measure about Ames and her husband, the famed Harvard orchid expert (also an Ames but no relation). Then after a little research, he says, \u201cI was immediately fascinated by this woman.\u201dIn one of her most audacious moves, Ames, who was born in 1878, carved a wooden penis, then trotted it out on Commonwealth Avenue to demonstrate proper condom use. Authorities arrested her only to discover she was the daughter of a governor. This anecdote and others relayed in the first five minutes of \u201cBorderland: The Life & Times of Blanche Ames Ames\u201d sets a swoon-worthy tone for audiences hungry for dynamic women role models. For the remaining 45 or so minutes Blanche Ames Ames never disappoints.Told with an abundance of archival family photographs as well as through documents held at Smith College (where Ames served as president of her 1899 senior class), \u201cBorderland\u201d sketches out her distinguished family lineage. War generals come from both sides. She had a Shakespearean actress grandmother. Her father Adelbert Ames served as a Reconstructionist Mississippi senator, then governor, before the family moved to Lowell. Her mother Blanche Butler Ames wrote extensively, a lifetime of letters published into a book.Many film narratives would\u2019ve shifted gears directly from college to Ames\u2019 marriage into a family with similar or more influence.\u00a0 Her husband, Oakes Ames, was the son of a Massachusetts governor and inheritor of railroad money. But \u201cBorderland\u201d sensibly pauses on the couple\u2019s rocky early years when they lived with her husband\u2019s mother; the independent-minded Ames and her Victorian mother-in-law clashed. Ames also found the inequities of child rearing highly problematic. She criticized her husband\u2019s inaction and wrote to her mother that \u201cmarriage has added to my burdens.\u201dBlanche and Oakes Ames. (Courtesy BCN Productions)\u201cBorderland\u2019s\u201d writer and narrator Kate Klise surmises that building and moving into Borderland \u201csaved their marriage.\u201d Acknowledging this likelihood allows for a rarely seen story about a couple that prospers while also advocating for women\u2019s rights. Oakes publicly champions women\u2019s suffrage alongside his wife and she illustrates his books on orchids. \u201cHe definitely stood by Blanche,\u201d says Friend.All of this makes Ames\u2019 struggles more relatable to Klise. \u201cShe feels so contemporary, everything she was fighting for, it\u2019s where we are today still,\u201d she says. The author of more than 30 children\u2019s books, Klise fell for Ames while researching her life during writer-in-residence terms at Queset house, part of the Ames Free Library. Friend says that\u2019s why he approached her to help with production and draft the film\u2019s script.While mobilizing on behalf of women\u2019s suffrage, to the point where she helped un-seat U.S. Senator John Weeks in 1919, Ames also started voicing support for access to birth control (something that would not become legally available in Massachusetts until 1966). She devised a form of a diaphragm, among other inventions, and served 19 years as Birth Control League of Massachusetts\u2019 president. The film categorizes her as more progressive than Margaret Sanger.Klise points out that when people think of birth control they probably think of Sanger. And only Sanger. When they think of suffrage it\u2019s Elizabeth Cady Stanton. \u201cPeople can recall many sports names, or all the characters on 'Friends,' but we can\u2019t name six women suffragists? We have to do better,\u201d she implores. This frustrates her because then people may \u201cfeel like [all we need is] one hero to come along and lead the way.\u201dThe Stonehill College premiere kicks off a string of screenings Friend\u2019s company BCN Productions intends to plan throughout the region. Friend especially wants upper high school and college students to see the film, which they can request for free. A teacher\u2019s guide and scholar-led discussions are also underway.Friend says that Ames\u2019 pragmatic New England approach to getting things done has stuck with him. \u201cWhat I learned through Blanche is don\u2019t get emotional about it, just find a way to win,\u201d or in other words, \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. Get even.\u2019\u201d\"Borderland: The Life & Times of Blanche Ames Ames\" will premiere at McCarthy Auditorium, Stonehill College on Saturday, Feb. 22, 7 p.m.Film/TVErin Trahan Film WriterErin Trahan writes about film for WBUR.More\u2026AdvertisementMore from WBURResumeListen LiveLoading...CloseWBURWBUR90.0 WBUR - Boston's NPR News StationNPRContact Us(617) 353-0909info@wbur.org890 Commonwealth Ave.Boston, MA 02215More ways to get in touch.About WBURWho We AreInside WBURCareersWBUR StaffCommunity Advisory BoardBoard Of DirectorsCPB TransparencyDiversity, Equity And InclusionLicensing WBUR ContentEthics GuideSupport WBURMake A DonationBecome A MemberMember ServicesDonate Your CarJoin The Murrow SocietyBecome A SponsorVolunteerFollowfacebook Facebook Instagram YouTube Linkedin\u00a9 Copyright WBUR 2024WBUR Privacy PolicyWBUR EEO ReportsFCC Public FileFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceSyndicationThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply."
