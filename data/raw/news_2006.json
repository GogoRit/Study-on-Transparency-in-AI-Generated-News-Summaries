Doctors \u2013 specifically, those who care for pregnant women and perform abortions \u2013 are fleeing the state due to new abortion restrictions. \n    \n\n            Doctors like Lauren Miller, who has been treating women and performing abortions in Boise for the last five years. Her greatest fear? \u201cBeing tried as a felon simply for saving someone\u2019s life,\u201d she told CNN.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee where abortions are banned and legal -- and where it's still in limbo\n\n\n\n\n            Miller specializes in maternal-fetal medicine at the hospital where she works and handles high-risk pregnancies. She treats complications such as ectopic pregnancies, where a fertilized egg is outside the uterus, pre-eclampsia and other dangerous conditions.\n    \n\n            After Idaho passed a near-total abortion ban, Miller and other doctors like her say they are unsure about how to continue to do their job. \n    \n\n            Last August, Idaho made abortion illegal, with two exceptions.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\n\nMaternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road   \n\n\n\n\n            An abortion can still be performed if the mother\u2019s life is in danger, and in the case of rape or incest, but only after a police report has been filed and provided to the doctor. Even then, it\u2019s restricted to the first trimester. But Miller says the law is still somewhat murky.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe have a death exception and that is it without any other guidelines,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t act fast enough to save your life, prevent you from getting septic, I could be liable for civil cases \u2026 malpractice. But if I act too quickly and I\u2019m not 100% certain that the patient is going to die from the complication she\u2019s sustaining, then I could be guilty of a felony.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that bar is and no one wants to be the guinea pig first test case of that,\u201d Miller told CNN.\n    \n\n            State Representative Brent J. Crane, the lead negotiator on the bill, characterized the law as \u201ca work in progress,\u201d acknowledging to CNN that lawmakers are going to have to \u201ccome back and do more work to define what constitutes a risk to a mother\u2019s life in those highly nuanced situations.\u201d\n    \n\n    Unable to help \n\n\n            Complicating matters more, the new law, which went into effect in August 2022, allows certain family members of a patient to sue providers who perform an abortion for at least $20,000 if the procedure breaks the abortion law.\n    \n\n            Doctors in those cases also face suspension of their medical license, felony charges and even prison time. \n    \n\n            Beyond that, Idaho\u2019s governor also signed a law that says anyone helping a minor travel out of state to terminate a pregnancy \u2013 without parental consent \u2013 is guilty of a crime. \n    \n\n            Miller, who is also head of the Idaho Coalition for Safe Reproductive Health, calls it \u201cmoral injury.\u201d It saddens her that she cannot provide the care she\u2019s been trained to offer.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt goes against what we\u2019re taught as physicians to protect the health of our patients,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n            So, she decided to move her practice to Colorado, where abortion is still legal. And she\u2019s not the only one leaving.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDorbert, 33, learned during her pregnancy that her fetus had abnormalities that would cause death soon after delivery.\n\nGary White/The Lakeland Ledger/USA Today Network\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of Florida abortion laws, she carried her baby to term knowing he would die \n\n\n\n\n            Of the 117 doctors she informally surveyed in Idaho, 75 answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d when asked if they were considering leaving the state at least in part because of the abortion laws. \n    \n\n            Dr. Kylie Cooper, who worked alongside Miller, has already moved with her family out of Idaho and is now practicing in Minnesota, where abortion is legal.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt was a really difficult decision to make \u2026 there was a wave of emotions, lots of fear and anxiety for my patients and also for myself\u2026my husband and I had many conversations about what would it actually look like if I was charged with a felony and then went to prison,\u201d she told CNN.\n    \n\n            Cooper says she feels much safer after leaving Idaho. \n    \n\n            \u201cTo watch somebody get sicker in front of your eyes and not be able to help them is hard to comprehend,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not the way I was trained to practice medicine. We don\u2019t let people get so sick when we have all the tools to help them.\u201d\n    \n\n    \u2018The beginning of the collapse of an entire system\u2019 \n\n\n            Back in Idaho, Miller says five of the nine remaining full-time maternal-fetal medicine physicians in the state will have left by the end of this year.  \n    \n\n            These are the doctors who deal with the most significant pregnancy complications, an essential service to their patients.   \n    \n\n            Jim Souza, the chief physician executive at St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in Boise, told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of the collapse of an entire system of care.\u201d\n    \n\n            He likened it to a Jenga tower: \u201cYou can pull out certain planks and the tower still stands,\u201d he said. \u201cBut pull out too many planks or certain planks and the whole thing falls \u2026 unfortunately that\u2019s the position we\u2019re in right now.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA general view of an exam room inside the Hope Clinic For Women in Granite City, Illinois, on June 27, 2022. \n\nAngela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion clinics saw an increase in violence and threats in 2022, report says\n\n\n\n\n            Souza says that Idaho has already lost many of its maternal-fetal medicine physicians. \n    \n\n            \u201cIf the momentum doesn\u2019t shift, and we continue to pull planks out of the Jenga tower of this system of care,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no question that that there will be bad perinatal outcomes for moms and babies. You need these providers in order to provide the safety net.\u201d\n    \n\n            And because there are no ob-gyn residencies in Idaho, finding doctors willing to relocate given the abortion laws on the books is a real challenge. \n    \n\n            Still, Souza told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m an optimist at heart.\u201d\n    \n\n            While doctors in Idaho are already warning the public about the risks these abortion restrictions pose to the health of expectant mothers, there won\u2019t be any data to show the real impact these laws have on the maternal mortality rate in Idaho. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKzenon/Adobe Stock\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter fall of Roe, future doctors show less interest in training in states with abortion bans or as ob/gyns\n\n\n\n\n            That\u2019s because this July, Idaho\u2019s state legislature is due to sunset the Maternal Mortality Review Committee, which tracks pregnancy deaths.  \n    \n\n            In light of that, Miller warned, \u201cWe won\u2019t see the bad outcomes that occur secondary to these laws being in place. It\u2019s like we\u2019re trying to hide that information from the public so we can\u2019t see the repercussions of not having access to safe abortion care. I have no doubt that the mortality rate will rise.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
