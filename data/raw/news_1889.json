Wade, ending nearly 50 years of federal protection for abortion, some states began enforcing strict abortion bans while others became new havens for the procedure. ProPublica is investigating how sweeping changes to reproductive health care access in America are affecting people, institutions and governments.\n \n\n\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

Her embryo had become implanted in scar tissue from a recent cesarean section, and she was in serious danger. At any moment, the pregnancy could rupture, blowing open her uterus.\nDr. Mack Goldberg, who was trained in abortion care for life-threatening pregnancy complications, pulled up the patient\u2019s charts. He did not like the look of them. The muscle separating her pregnancy from her bladder was as thin as tissue paper; her placenta threatened to eventually invade her organs like a tumor. Even with the best medical care in the world, some patients bleed out in less than 10 minutes on the operating table. Goldberg had seen it happen.\nMayron Michelle Hollis stood to lose her bladder, her uterus and her life. She was desperate to end the pregnancy. On the phone, the two doctors agreed this was the best path forward, guided by recommendations from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, an association of 5,500 experts on high-risk pregnancy. The longer they waited, the more complicated the procedure would be.\nBut it was Aug. 24, and performing an abortion was hours away from becoming a felony in Tennessee. There were no explicit exceptions. Prosecutors could choose to charge any doctor who terminated any pregnancy with a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. If charged, the doctor would have the burden of proving in front of a judge or jury that the procedure was necessary to save the patient\u2019s life, similar to claiming self-defense in a homicide case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\nGet Our Top Investigations\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail address:\n\n\n\n\nArrow Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\nThanks for signing up.

There was no institutional process to help them make a final call. Hospitals have malpractice lawyers but do not typically employ criminal lawyers. Even local criminal lawyers weren\u2019t sure what to say \u2014 they had no precedent to draw on, and the attorney general and the governor weren\u2019t issuing any clarifications. Under the law, it was possible a prosecutor could argue Hollis\u2019 case wasn\u2019t an immediate emergency, just a potential risk in the future.\nGoldberg was only a month into his first job as a full-fledged staff doctor, launching his career in one of the most hostile states for reproductive health care in America, yet he was confident he could stand in a courtroom and attest that Hollis\u2019 condition was life-threatening. But to perform an abortion safely, he would need a team of other providers to agree to take on the same legal risks. Hollis wanted to keep her uterus so she could one day get pregnant again. That made the operation more complicated, because a pregnant uterus draws extra blood to it, increasing the risk of hemorrhage.\nGoldberg spent the next two days trying to rally support from his colleagues for a procedure that would previously have been routine.\nVanderbilt declined to comment for this article, but Hollis\u2019 doctors spoke to ProPublica in their personal capacity, with her permission, risking backlash in order to give the public a rare view into the dangers created when lawmakers interfere with high-stakes medical care.\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee Lobbyists Oppose New Lifesaving Exceptions in Abortion Ban\n\n\n\nFirst, Goldberg and a colleague tried the interventional radiology department. To lower Hollis\u2019 chance of bleeding, Goldberg wanted doctors to insert a special gel into the artery that supplied blood to her uterus to reduce its flow. But that department\u2019s leadership didn\u2019t feel comfortable participating.\nNext, they approached a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who a week earlier had said he would be able to provide an injection to stop the fetus from growing and decrease blood flow. But once the law went into effect, that specialist grew uneasy, he told ProPublica. He asked that his name not be used because of the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe specialist would have to do the procedure in a room of nurses and scrub techs with an ultrasound image projected on the wall \u2014 all potential evidence that could be used against him in a trial. He thought about his family, what it would mean to go to prison. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed in myself,\u201d he told Goldberg and his colleague as he refused to participate.\nThat night, Goldberg went home and buried his face into the soft fur of his 100-pound Bernedoodle dog, Louie. He believed strongly that knowing how to perform an abortion was a necessary part of health care; he\u2019d spent two years training in Pittsburgh to have the skills to help people like Hollis. Now he felt like everyone was leaving him alone with the responsibility. He worried about being able to manage that massive bleed alone.\nHe felt sick when he told Grimm his decision: \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nDr. Mack Goldberg, shown here with his dog, had training in complex abortion care and wanted to help Mayron Hollis, but his colleagues feared they could be prosecuted under the new law.\n\n\nGrimm felt a mix of anger, fear and sadness burning beneath his ribs. He could scarcely believe the situation. Raised Christian in the deep South, he had never agreed with abortion as a moral choice. But as an OB-GYN whose patient was in mortal peril, he couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend what politicians were thinking. He had told Hollis an abortion ban was coming, but had thought there would be an exception for cases like hers that came with high risks.\nHe knew Hollis would have difficulty traveling. It began to sink in: The families who would most starkly bear the consequences of the law would be those with little means, whose fragile stability could be disrupted by any unexpected hurdle.\nHe collected himself as he dialed Hollis. It was Aug. 26, the day after the ban went into effect.\nIt was also Hollis\u2019 32nd birthday. She was at her job as an insulator apprentice, monitoring her co-workers as they wrapped rolls of fiberglass around pipes, when she saw Grimm\u2019s name flash on her phone. She headed outside, her long hair coiled under a hard hat, her stomach churning.\nThe past month had been a dizzying, sickening whirlwind of thrill, then worry, then stubborn hope, then all-consuming terror. She didn\u2019t want to lose her pregnancy, but she didn\u2019t want to die. She had anguished over the decision, prayed about it with her husband, gotten a second opinion and gone around and around with Grimm.\nNow, as she stepped outside to take the call, all she wanted to hear was her doctor\u2019s usual calm reassurance and the plan for her care. \nBut Grimm\u2019s voice was heavy as he began: \n\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollis and her OB-GYN, Dr. Barry Grimm, had to navigate a life-threatening pregnancy under Tennessee\u2019s new abortion ban.\n\n\n\nFew Tennessee lawmakers stopped to consider the ramifications when they gathered in 2019 to pass what would wind up being one of the nation\u2019s most severe abortion bans.\nIt was a trigger law, just words on paper as long as federal abortion rights granted by a 1973 Supreme Court ruling remained in place. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Roe v. Wade was on the verge of being overturned,\u201d said state Sen. Richard Briggs, a heart surgeon who co-sponsored the bill. \u201cIt was theoretical at that point.\u201d\nTo many, the ban seemed like a publicity stunt. It didn\u2019t even get much pushback from doctors or abortion-rights advocates.\nBut the influential anti-abortion group National Right to Life was following a strategy.\nFor decades, the group\u2019s leaders have written and lobbied for model legislation aimed at injecting their particular vision of morality into abortion regulations around the country. In many conservative states, they exert a stranglehold on politics, publishing annual scorecards to track lawmakers\u2019 votes on anti-abortion legislation and funding primary challengers against candidates they don\u2019t consider committed enough.\nInvigorated by President Trump\u2019s conservative Supreme Court nominations starting in 2018, they pushed so-called \u201ctrigger bans,\u201d designed to go into effect in a future where Roe was overturned. It\u2019s an approach Bob Ramsey, a Republican legislator in Tennessee at the time, likened to throwing spaghetti at the wall \u201cto see what sticks.\u201d\nRepublican lawmakers knew that voting against the abortion ban bill could spell political peril.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it's all about the next election,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get together and debate the morality of pro-choice or the confusion for medical providers. It was pretty much a foregone conclusion.\u201d In the end, he abstained, and lost his next primary to an opponent who castigated him for not being anti-abortion enough.\nBut the law sailed through without Ramsey, on party lines.\n\n\n\nRoe v. Wade was still in effect when Republican lawmakers voted for Tennessee's abortion ban.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision came on June 24, 2022. Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban kicked in two months later. Overnight, procedures that had not been considered \u201cabortion\u201d by many, but simply part of reproductive health care, were a crime. That included offering dilation and evacuation procedures to patients whose water broke too early or who started bleeding heavily in their first trimester. Terminating dangerous pregnancies that never result in a viable birth, like those that settle inside a fallopian tube or develop into a tumor, was also technically an abortion. Each case now presents doctors with an ethical dilemma: Provide the patient the standard of care accepted by the medical community and face a potential felony charge, or try to comply with the broadest interpretation of the law and risk a malpractice case.\nNational Right to Life considers Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban its \u201cstrongest\u201d law, and the group\u2019s Tennessee lobbyist has said the law should only permit abortions that are urgently necessary, such as for someone bleeding out, and not allow those \u201cto prevent a future medical emergency.\u201d\nGov. Bill Lee has defended the law as providing \u201cmaximum protection possible for both mother and child.\u201d But some who voted in favor of the bill have since acknowledged they didn\u2019t read it closely or understand how completely it tied the hands of doctors. Briggs, the bill\u2019s co-sponsor, has advocated for changes and lost the endorsement of Tennessee Right to Life.\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe Need to Defend This Law\u201d: Inside an Anti-Abortion Meeting With Tennessee\u2019s GOP Lawmakers\n\n\n\nTennessee\u2019s ban and others triggered across the country are already unleashing havoc. The uncertainty over how the vague standards will be treated in the courts has created a chilling effect on patient care, doctors and other experts say. Though most bans contain exceptions for abortions necessary to prevent a patient\u2019s death or \u201ca serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\u201d data suggests few people have been able to access abortions under those exceptions.\nProPublica reviewed news articles, medical journal studies and lawsuits and found at least 70 examples across 12 states of women with pregnancy complications who were denied abortion care or had the treatment delayed since Roe was overturned. Doctors say the true number is much higher.\nSome of the women reported being forced to wait until they were septic or had filled diapers with blood before getting help for their imminent miscarriages. Others were made to continue high-risk pregnancies and give birth to babies that had virtually no chance of survival. Some pregnant patients rushed across state lines to get treated for a condition that was rapidly deteriorating.\nDr. Leilah Zahedi-Spung, a maternal-fetal specialist who left Tennessee in January because of the trigger ban, said that after the law went into effect, she referred an average of three to four patients out of state every week for abortion care to address high-risk conditions she could no longer help with.\nBut, she said, not everyone has the resources or ability to leave the state for an abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\nHollis said she was distraught when Grimm told her the abortion ban would limit her options.\n\n\nRaised in the depths of Tennessee\u2019s opioid epidemic in a family haunted by addiction, Hollis\u2019 earliest memory is of clutching her baby brother when she was 5 years old, as her alcoholic father flipped tables. When she was 9, she said, her mother\u2019s boyfriend gave her drugs and read her the Bible before he molested her. By 12, she was living with a teenage boyfriend and babysitting his brothers in exchange for hydrocodone pills.\nAt 21, Hollis began having children: first a son and then two daughters. At 27, when she had her third child, she was trying to stay sober. But the father of that child, Chris Hollis, showed up to the hospital high on opioids. The Department of Children\u2019s Services drug tested him and took custody of all of Hollis\u2019 children.\nIf her life with her kids had been chaotic, hustling to survive in the pill mill economy and dealing with multiple arrests, her life without them was a black hole of shame and self-hatred. She gave in to drugs and fights and ended up living on the street; one day, in September 2019, she landed in the hospital after an attempted suicide. Three days later, she was a passenger in a car crash that killed a close friend. It was at that moment that she decided she wanted to live. She went from the hospital to rehab.\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe Wanted an Abortion. A Judge Said She Wasn\u2019t Mature Enough to Decide.\n\n\n\nWhen Grimm met her in 2021, at a clinic for mothers with opioid use disorder, she was pregnant with her fourth child and sober. He believed Hollis could stay that way; she was sufficiently exhausted by her cycles of addiction. He often used her progress forging a new path for her family to inspire other mothers in the program. He liked her fast-talking boldness and how she owned her past. She liked the way he listened and didn\u2019t judge.\nAfter baby Zooey arrived in February 2022, it seemed to Hollis like life was finally gathering momentum. She had reconnected with Chris Hollis, who she first befriended working at Wendy\u2019s as a teenager. She had always known he held a flame for her, from the time he offered to take her duties cleaning the Frosty machine. Over the years they broke up and reconnected multiple times.\nNow both in recovery, they had gotten married, rented a house in Clarksville, a small town near a military base, and joined a church. Together, they ran a small vinyl siding business. Hollis managed the accounting and worked a factory job for extra income. She began to study for her peer recovery specialist certification, imagining a day when she would help other mothers climb out of addiction. She hoped to save enough money to buy a house and eventually pay lawyers to get her other children back.\nBut three months after Zooey\u2019s birth, Hollis faced a major setback.\nSomeone accused her of leaving her daughter unsupervised in a car outside a vape shop, records show. Hollis disputed it, but the Department of Children\u2019s Services put Zooey in the custody of her cousin while they investigated the allegation of child endangerment. Hollis and her husband moved out so the cousin could live at their family home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollis was introduced to drugs at a young age. She reconnected with a longtime friend, Chris Hollis, once they both got sober. Hollis was afraid the Department of Children\u2019s Services might take custody of her 5-month-old daughter Zooey at the same time she learned she was pregnant again.\n\n\nThen, in July, Hollis was shocked to learn she was pregnant again; she\u2019d just begun taking birth control pills, but it might have been too recent for them to be effective. Her first call was to Grimm, who worried that a pregnancy this soon, on top of four previous C-sections, put her at risk of developing a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. By Hollis\u2019 eight-week ultrasound in early August, Grimm\u2019s worst fears were confirmed.\nHer life was at risk, he told her. Her pregnancy could rupture and cause a hemorrhage in the first trimester. It was almost certain to eventually develop into a life-threatening placenta disorder. There was little data to predict whether the baby would make it. If it survived, it was sure to be born extremely early, spend months in critical care and face developmental challenges. He offered to schedule an abortion for two days later. If they moved quickly, the procedure would be relatively straightforward. But Hollis needed time to think.\nShe\u2019d felt a faint thrill when she learned about the tiny life inside of her. Building a family with her husband in their fragile new stability had felt like a chance to redeem herself. Abortion went against her beliefs. What if this was her last chance to have another child?\nGrimm gave her his cell phone number. \u201cWant you to know this is so difficult,\u201d he texted. \u201cWith you, no matter what you decide.\u201d\nIt was the second opinion, two weeks later, that convinced her. Doctors at another hospital confirmed her condition was, indeed, life-threatening and already worsening. One of the only places in Tennessee equipped to handle a pregnancy as complicated as hers was Vanderbilt.\n\u201cHoney,\u201d her husband told her, \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d\n\n\n\nMayron and Chris Hollis wanted another child but had to weigh the risks to Mayron\u2019s health.\n\n\nOn Aug. 24, about two weeks after learning the diagnosis, she messaged her doctor: \n\u201cDr. Grimm, me and my husband need to talk to you. We have really thought about everything and we need you to call us.\u201d\nBut two days later, Hollis paced outside her workplace listening to Grimm break the news that the other doctors had backed out \u201cdue to the current legal climate.\u201d\nThe only thought Hollis could muster was no. No no no no no. This could not be happening. Not now.\nShe squeezed her thumb in her fist as Grimm explained that Vanderbilt couldn\u2019t offer an abortion that would try to preserve her uterus \u2014 only a hysterectomy that would end the pregnancy and extinguish any chances she could ever get pregnant again. Grimm told ProPublica it was his understanding that ending the pregnancy this way would comply with the law\u2019s provision for avoiding irreversible impairment to a major bodily function. Other doctors involved in her care confirmed they felt their only option for providing an abortion was to sterilize her.\nGrimm told Hollis they could help her arrange to travel out of state, where doctors could perform an abortion and possibly save her uterus. Each day that passed would make that more difficult. Going to Pittsburgh, where Goldberg had connections, was her best option, but would require days of travel to complete paperwork and comply with Pennsylvania\u2019s state-mandated waiting period.\nHollis felt trapped in a different kind of risk calculation: At the same time the state was trying to force her to keep her pregnancy, it was also threatening to take away her daughter.\nAlready, she and her husband hovered over their phones in case Zooey\u2019s case workers needed their attention. She worried she might be accused of abandonment if she left. She also feared losing her job. Her bosses at the factory had laid her off for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d after learning she was pregnant for a second time in less than a year, she said. She had just started a new job and relied on it to help pay two rents and $9,000 for a lawyer to fight to keep Zooey. She didn\u2019t know where she would get money for a sudden trip anyway.\nShe hung up with Grimm, went back inside and cried for the rest of her shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ultrasound confirmed a high-risk cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, but Hollis couldn\u2019t afford to travel out of state for abortion care. She feared losing the job that paid for lawyers to fight her child welfare case.\n\n\n\nAs the months passed, Tennessee\u2019s medical community grappled with the real world implications of the new legal landscape.\nVanderbilt, the largest hospital in the state and a private institution, promised its doctors it would pay to defend against any criminal charges and was able to resume offering limited medically indicated abortion care, according to multiple doctors. Vanderbilt declined to comment.\nGoldberg and his colleagues\u2019 approach evolved. They began to admit nearly every patient and make each specialist individually assess them. It was costly and time-consuming, but Goldberg believed it made a difference for medical providers to have to look a patient in the eye before refusing to participate in their care. If they agreed an abortion was appropriate, he wrote up long defenses of the patient\u2019s condition and had three other doctors sign off.\nStill, almost weekly, Goldberg found himself having to turn away patients he believed should qualify for medically indicated abortion care. He and his colleagues also noticed that doctors at smaller hospitals, who had far less support, seemed to be treating complex cases as hot potatoes and sending them to Vanderbilt. That delayed care for patients. Goldberg worried about those who might not get transferred in time.\nProPublica spoke with 20 Tennessee medical providers about life under the ban, on condition of anonymity because they feared professional and personal repercussions; some said that they had witnessed a new trepidation in their ranks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen colleagues delay or sit on assessing the clinical data longer when they know the diagnosis is probably ectopic,\u201d one said, referring to pregnancies that implant outside the uterine cavity, which are always life-threatening. \u201cPeople were like, 'I don\u2019t want to be involved because I don\u2019t want to go to prison,'\u201d said another. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2014 even assessing the patient or having a role in their care makes people scared.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Goldberg\u2019s wife, a therapist who asked that her name not be published to protect their family\u2019s privacy, was hearing from a number of pregnant patients who had bled for weeks, but didn\u2019t understand why. Their providers hadn\u2019t mentioned the word \u201cmiscarriage\u201d or offered dilation and evacuation procedures. Instead they were told, \u201cLet your body do what it\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow an Anti-Abortion Law Firm Teamed Up With a Disgraced Kansas Attorney to Dispute the 2020 Election\n\n\n\nOnce the ban went into effect, Hollis felt doctors in Tennessee were afraid to touch her. A few days after her conversation with Grimm, overwhelmed, she texted him: \u201cSchedule a hysterectomy.\u201d He asked her to call him, but before she could, she began to feel an intense pain that made her double over.\nShe went to an emergency room near her home, but left after an hour without being seen. She drove to Vanderbilt and told workers she was at risk for a placenta disorder, the complication Grimm had told her she was showing signs of developing, hoping to get seen more urgently. \u201cNobody even looked at me after that,\u201d she said. She remembered waiting for hours in triage, crying and incontinent, until she gave up and headed to a third hospital, which gave her antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. Doctors had spent weeks explaining her condition was life-threatening; she didn\u2019t understand how she could be left to sit in a waiting room.\nShe never brought up the hysterectomy again. \u201cI thought the law meant I couldn\u2019t have one,\u201d she said. Grimm didn\u2019t follow up about the text and said he always remembered Hollis emphatically saying she wanted to try to preserve her fertility.\nAs friends and coworkers began to ask her about her visible pregnancy, Hollis acted excited. But there was nothing happy about the experience. She constantly worried about what her husband and Zooey would do if she died, and called up the Social Security Administration and her union to find out what kind of survivor benefits existed. She moved through her days trying to pretend she wasn\u2019t pregnant. It was the only way to keep the overwhelming fear at bay and continue working. Then, in mid-November, her employer laid her off, saying it couldn\u2019t accommodate the work restrictions required by her doctor.\nAt regular appointments, Grimm watched in horror as her placenta began to bulge and threaten her bladder, an expected consequence of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. She was exhibiting all the signs of developing placenta percreta, the worst form of a placenta disorder, a condition that makes high-risk specialists shudder. Delivery requires massive blood transfusions, often necessitates removal of the bladder and carries a 7% chance of death.\nGrimm didn\u2019t know what to do for Hollis other than to lower his boundaries and try to support her whenever she needed him. Her texts came at all hours \u2014 about her problems sleeping, her concerns about paying rent, her worries about the baby\u2019s movement and the pains she felt. She had not been at her company long enough to qualify for disability leave and begged him to help her appeal: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what else to do, I am running out of time and I\u2019m scared.\u201d\nIn the end, he couldn\u2019t offer much more than directing her to social workers and sharing earnest platitudes: \u201cYou\u2019re the bravest person I know,\u201d he told her.\n\n\n\nAfter Hollis was unable to get abortion care, Grimm, her OB-GYN, watched her condition progress into a dangerous placenta disorder.\n\n\nGrimm\u2019s wife noticed the weight he carried home. He found it difficult to be present, zoning out at his kids\u2019 sports games and leaving the dinner table to respond to calls. The culture of medicine assumed that doctors always had the answers and could never make mistakes. But Grimm felt helpless and wrestled with feelings of shame. In his darkest moments, he wondered if a different doctor would have somehow done better by her.\nGrimm had always stayed out of politics. But in conversations with family and friends, he began to share more about his work for the first time. Many in his circle abhorred abortion and thought they supported the idea of a ban. He tried to explain that it was more complex. \u201cIf this was your wife or my wife in these really intense situations, they'd be fine, because you have the resources,\u201d he told them. \u201cBut some people don\u2019t. And they\u2019re going to be forced into these impossible situations where they could die.\u201d\nHe knew of doctors who had left the profession after losing a pregnant patient. He wondered if this would be his quitting moment.\n\n\nOn Dec. 8, Hollis started bleeding. She was nearly 26 weeks pregnant. She insisted on driving herself to Vanderbilt, an hour away from her home; her husband joined her in the passenger seat and panicked when she started to pass out. They called 911, and an ambulance drove her the rest of the way.\nDr. Sarah Osmundson, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, was on call that day. She worked exclusively with the most difficult pregnancies, where every decision was a calculation between a pregnant patient\u2019s health and the chances of delivering a healthy baby. It was her job to help patients make an informed decision. Over the years, she said, she had seen some women choose to accept the risks of a dangerous diagnosis and die as a result. But since the law went into effect, patients were arriving at her office asking why they were being counseled all: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d they told her. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\nShe could tell Hollis was scared; she felt afraid as well. While she and her colleagues worked to help patients go out of state, she knew of some with cancer, heart conditions, preeclampsia or fatal fetal anomalies who felt forced to continue their pregnancies under the law. She feared it was only a matter of time until one of them died from the complications. She hoped it would not be Hollis.\nShe wanted Hollis to stay in the hospital for monitoring, but Hollis begged to go home. Zooey\u2019s child welfare case had been closed in October, and she didn\u2019t want to be away from her baby any longer than necessary. She had Christmas presents to wrap, bills to pay and a nursery to set up before her new baby arrived. On top of everything, her fridge was empty and her washer and dryer had stopped working.\nOsmundson gave Hollis her phone number, and the hospital released her after three days, planning for her to return in two weeks, when her pregnancy had reached seven months.\n\n\n\nDr. Sarah Osmundson, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, worries it\u2019s a matter of time until a patient dies of pregnancy complications because of the law.\n\n\nBut less than two days later, in the early morning hours of Dec. 13, Hollis\u2019 husband woke to screaming. He ran to her and slipped in her blood, which was pooling on the ground. Hollis had bled through her pants, soaking her socks and the rug by the front door. She and her husband texted photos to Osmundson, who became convinced an emergency cesarean needed to happen as soon as possible.\nAs soon as Grimm\u2019s phone rang, he was wide awake. He lay in bed in the dark, calling the hospital and refreshing his phone for updates. At any moment, he knew, Hollis could bleed to death.\nHollis\u2019 husband called an ambulance, and they took her to a local hospital to be stabilized and airlifted. But bad weather meant the helicopter couldn\u2019t fly. Finally, two hours later, they returned to the ambulance, which drove her to Vanderbilt.\nHollis was relieved to see Grimm waiting in his scrubs. He held her hand as they wheeled her into the operating room, which was filled with a surgery team of nearly 20 doctors. She looked pale and petrified. \u201cWe will be right there with you the whole time,\u201d he told her.\nTo Hollis, the doctors around her looked as scared as she was. The anesthesiologist told Hollis to count backwards from 10, but instead she prayed.\nOnce Hollis was under, Grimm helped make the incision. Typically, patients emerge from a C-section with a small, horizontal cut below their bikini line. But this delivery called for a vertical gash that stretched up past her navel so doctors could have full exposure to her uterus. It allowed them to see where the bleeding was coming from and gave them the best chance to control it.\nCareful not to disrupt the placenta, which was attached to the bladder and ballooning outward, Grimm gently removed a baby girl. She emerged weighing one pound and 15 ounces, limp and unable to breathe on her own. Doctors dried and intubated her, wrapped her and placed her under a radiant warmer to try to keep her organs from shutting down. No one knew if she would survive.\n\n\n\nProPublica\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe Wanted an Abortion. A Judge Said She Wasn\u2019t Mature Enough to Decide.\n\n\n\nThen, Dr. Marta Crispens, a gynecological oncologist trained to deal with big tumors, began work on removing the uterus. The placenta started gushing blood again. This was what made the condition so frightening: There was no predicting the level of bleeding and whether it could be contained in time. The intensity in the room ratcheted up. It seemed to Grimm like hours passed as he helped Crispens stanch the bleeding, though it was only minutes.\nHollis was given a blood transfusion. Finally, the operation ended. Hollis and her daughter had made it through alive.\nAs the doctors cleaned up, there were the usual back pats and shared congratulations between a team that had united to make it through a life-saving surgery. But they could all recall similar cases where things didn\u2019t end as well.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s OK,\u201d Osmundson recalled saying in the moment. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tragedy that this happened \u2014 this is not a win.\u201d\nCrispens felt everyone in the room was traumatized. \u201cThis is going to drive people out of the medical profession,\u201d she thought. \u201cWe took an oath \u2014 we have to be able to take care of these women before they get to this point.\u201d\nGrimm left the room, peeled off his scrubs and wept. \nWhen Hollis awoke from surgery, he was holding her hand. \n\n\nBaby Elayna spent the first week of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit, enclosed in a plastic crib that resembled an aquarium. Nurses bustled in and out to the sound of beeping that monitored the baby\u2019s fluctuating breathing and heart rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElayna, born at 26 weeks and two days, in the second week of her life.\n\n\nHer skin was pink and translucent, wires and patches poked out from all over her body, and her tiny face was covered with a breathing machine. Nurses told Hollis that Elayna was too fragile to be held. Hollis could only stick a latex-gloved hand through a hole in the crib to feel Elayna\u2019s penny-sized grip on the tip of her finger. Over that first week, doctors monitored Elayna\u2019s brain for bleeding and poured a protein into her breathing tube to help her lungs open and close.\nThough Elayna's survival seemed assured, she faced significant hurdles. About 80% to 90% of babies born at 26 weeks survive. Of those, about 40% end up with brain injuries. Over the first two years of life, 12% may develop cerebral palsy, and some have vision, hearing and intellectual development issues. Elayna would be particularly vulnerable to flu and other respiratory illnesses. About half of babies born prematurely get readmitted to the hospital within the first two years. The cost of her care, which included more than two months in the NICU, would come out of the taxpayer-funded state Medicaid program.\nAfter four days, Hollis had to leave Elayna in the hospital and go home. There was no availability in charity housing for parents of NICU babies, and she needed to take care of Zooey. \nThen, three days later, sheriff\u2019s deputies showed up at Hollis\u2019 door and took her to jail.\nThough the child welfare case had been closed, now prosecutors were charging her with a felony over the same allegation that she left Zooey unattended in a car. She faced eight to 30 years in prison. She paid $6,000 in bail, erasing the savings she and her husband had hoped to use for parental leave. A judge\u2019s order prohibited her from having any contact with Zooey, so her husband took over child care. With nowhere to go, Hollis spent the night in her car outside the hospital, going inside for Elayna\u2019s feedings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA week after giving birth, Hollis was arrested and prohibited from returning to her home. She slept in her car in the parking garage of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and placed a video call to her psychiatrist.\n\n\nAs Elayna\u2019s lungs developed, her breathing improved. Every time Hollis managed to hold her daughter to her skin, her heart practically burst. She marveled at the fight inside such a small being and scribbled notes in a NICU progress book.\nBut her unrelenting challenges kept pulling her away. She and her husband quickly maxed out their $400 credit card limit on new legal fees and were down to a few dollars to pay for gas. Hollis knew she needed to get back to work.\nThree weeks after Elayna\u2019s birth, she returned to her job as an insulator apprentice and a punishing new routine: waking up at 4 a.m. to drive to the construction site an hour away, where she worked a 10-hour day for $16 an hour. Some evenings she went to school for her apprenticeship. Other nights she led an online Alcoholics Anonymous meeting to bolster her application for a peer recovery specialist certificate. She had finally been approved for housing near the hospital. Every chance she could, she ended the day with Elayna, but often she just had to catch up on sleep.\nThen she got a call from the Department of Children\u2019s Services. They were opening a new case because THC had been detected in Elayna\u2019s umbilical cord. Hollis believed it was due to delta-8, a synthetic THC legal in Tennessee that doctors recommend avoiding during pregnancy. Hollis said she took it after the stress of her first hospitalization to help her sleep; she considered it less dangerous than the heavy antidepressant drugs her doctors had prescribed. Grimm wrote a letter to the department in her defense; he saw THC as a minor issue and emphasized her consistent negative tests for deadly drugs.\nSometimes, Hollis felt gripped with anger over her situation. The way she saw it, the same system that had forced her to risk her life offered little support to help her family stabilize in the aftermath. She wasn\u2019t sure where to direct the blame, letting it spill out on her husband, other relatives and sometimes Grimm. She resented that she hadn\u2019t understood enough about the law early enough to make a different decision. If she had been able to get an abortion, she thought, \u201cmy life could be so different right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nHollis visited her daughter in the hospital as often as she could.\n\n\nShe heard that lawmakers were considering a change to the abortion law, to make it clear it was not a crime for doctors to provide abortion care in order to prevent life-threatening emergencies. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I have my baby,\u201d she wished she could tell them. \u201cBut this was a risk I didn\u2019t have any choice in taking.\u201d She knew others wouldn\u2019t be as lucky. On Tuesday, the state legislature is scheduled to consider bills aimed at creating clear medical exceptions. Tennessee Right to Life has strongly opposed it.\nElayna grew bigger and passed new milestones: Doctors found no bleeding in her brain. She began to breathe on her own and take in small amounts of milk. She was moved to a private room, where Hollis could sleep on a cot.\nOne night in early February, Hollis kissed Elayna, stretched out on the cot and tried to sleep amid the beeping, whirring and cries of babies in other rooms. Her mind was filled with worries about what life would look like once they left the safety net of the hospital, with its around-the-clock care and endless supply of formula and miniature diapers. She worried about managing it all, and about what could happen if she made another small mistake. She couldn\u2019t bear losing either of her daughters and hadn\u2019t even had a moment to process the loss of her uterus.\nShe drifted off and slept as the nurse fed the baby at midnight. Her iPhone alarm barely roused her at 3:30 a.m., time to get up for work. \nOn Feb. 23, the hospital told Hollis she could take her daughter home.\nElayna weighed four pounds and 12 ounces, still the size of one of Zooey\u2019s dolls. Nurses removed all the wires attached to her and tested her to make sure she could keep her head up in her car seat. A nurse handed Hollis a stack of papers that contained instructions on feeding and bathing a premature baby and appointments for eye doctors, heart and liver specialists and neurological providers.\nHollis gently placed Elayna in her car seat and buckled her in. She tried to focus on today. It was Zooey\u2019s first birthday, and the court had allowed them to live together again. Her husband was bringing home a cake and Hollis was desperate to have a moment to celebrate with her family. That night, relatives stopped by to greet the baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollis brought Elayna home after more than two months in the neonatal intensive care unit, on Zooey\u2019s first birthday.\n\n\nBut about a week later, Elayna began showing signs of respiratory distress. One night, she suddenly stopped breathing. Hollis performed CPR until police officers arrived and saved Elayna\u2019s life.\nTwo ambulance rides later, Elayna was airlifted to Vanderbilt. Over the following days, doctors found she had rhinovirus and outfitted her with a breathing machine. They told Hollis it was possible Elayna could have a bacterial infection, such as meningitis, in the fluid around her brain. To find out, they would need to do a spinal tap, but they worried it would destabilize her further. As Elayna\u2019s condition worsened, Hollis wasn\u2019t able to hold her because it might deplete her energy.\nHollis stayed as long as she could, but too much was waiting for her back home and she hated seeing her baby suffering. She whispered a quiet blessing and left Elayna in the pediatric intensive care unit, cocooned under the glow of a warming lamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after coming home, Elayna was back in the hospital due to breathing problems.\n\n\n\nHow we reported this story:\nMayron Michelle Hollis shared her medical records with ProPublica and authorized doctors to speak about her and her daughter\u2019s medical care. ProPublica spent months following her in the aftermath of her pregnancy  and spoke to family members who are mentioned in this story. Doctors involved in her care chose to go on the record or share background information in their personal capacity, not as representatives of Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt declined to comment on the case. ProPublica also interviewed 20 medical providers in Tennessee and spoke with five maternal-fetal medicine specialists not involved in Hollis\u2019 case about cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies and two neonatologists about babies born preterm.\n\n\n\nMariam Elba contributed research.\nPhoto editing by Andrea Wise.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under \u2014\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\nAbortion\n\n\nPregnancy\n\n\nSex and Gender\n\n\n\n\nProtect Independent Journalism\n\nThis story you\u2019ve just finished was funded by our readers.
