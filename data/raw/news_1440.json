Wade this summer, their decision ended the constitutional protection for abortion and activated a new law in Texas that makes performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to life in prison and has only narrow exceptions to save the life of a pregnant patient.\nOgg, who represents the state\u2019s most populous county, said pursuing such cases is impractical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur resources are so few to deal with the rise in violent crime,\u201d said Ogg. \u201cSo the idea that law enforcement is going to spend a lot of time investigating [abortion cases] seems low.\u201d She added that she was not sure how a law enforcement officer who lacks medical training would go about proving that a decision grounded in scientific evidence is illegal.\nOgg added that she is disturbed that the state\u2019s abortion laws provide no exceptions for rape or incest and hopes that members of the Texas Legislature revisit the law next year. Some Republicans have expressed a willingness to add new exceptions to the abortion law.\nA group of conservative lawmakers have developed a plan to circumvent any district attorneys who refuse to enforce abortion laws. State Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, said he\u2019d introduce legislation that would empower district attorneys from across the state to prosecute abortions outside their own county.\nWiley said that even though she is against abortion, she finds criminal penalties for abortion providers \u201cconcerning.\u201d And she opposes the idea of district attorneys pursuing charges against individuals outside of their own counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my personal beliefs, but I don\u2019t want to impose my beliefs on you or someone else,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cThis battle has been going on since the \u201970s and now we are taking it to a whole new criminality \u2014 that was unexpected.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune Festival is here!
