Tennessee Register file photo by Katie Peterson\nThe path to ending abortion is through peaceful prayer rather than harsh confrontation, said current and former leaders of pro-life prayer campaigns in Nashville.\nTheir efforts stand in contrast to allegations made in the recent indictment by a federal grand jury of 11 people on charges of obstructing a clinic that provides abortions outside Nashville.\nThe indictments allege the 11 defendants violated federal law by using physical obstruction to intimidate and interfere with the employees of the carafem Health Center clinic in Mt. Juliet and a patient seeking reproductive health services at the clinic in March 2022. The incident allegedly occurred several months before the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case on June 24, overturning the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion across the country.\nAfter the Dobbs ruling was announced, there were press reports of other incidents at carafem and the Planned Parenthood clinic in Nashville of protestors accosting vehicles in parking lots, threatening employees, and more.\u00a0\nJeff Coleman, a former leader of the 40 Days for Life prayer campaign in Nashville to end abortion, said the indictments and other events have not and will not affect 40 Days for Life peaceful vigils.\n\u201cWe at 40 Days have always been a peaceful, prayerful vigil. We do not allow anyone in our group to harass or intimidate anyone who is seeking an abortion,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cWe understand the importance of being there for these women who have found themselves in a very bad situation and give them every opportunity they need to save themselves and their children.\n\u201cThe pro-life movement is made of people whose passion can overtake them, and they feel the need to do more than just pray,\u201d he added. \u201cThe media will always use these types of situations to demonize the pro-life movement, and a few passionate people shouldn\u2019t taint the whole movement.\u201d\nThe 40 Days for Life organization requires participants to act peacefully, said Courtney Hayden, who led the fall 2021 and spring 2022 40 Days for Life campaigns in Nashville.\n\u201cThere are so many different groups fighting for an end to abortion. However, we are grateful for the rules and guidelines that 40 Days for Life has for its participants across the globe,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cSigning their \u2018statement of peace form\u2019 ensures that we will be peaceful, prayerful, and obedient to the rules that 40 Days has set forth for the safety of their participants and everyone around.\n\u201cFasting is another major component to 40 Days, and that\u2019s where we draw our strength. Abortion is a scary thing, for those getting one and for those praying on evil\u2019s territory, so this peaceful and loving approach is so needed in these dark times,\u201d she added. \u201cForty Days for Life will continue in Nashville until there are zero abortion facilities in the city.\u201d\nMarilyn Cox, who is the leader of the current campaign, which will continue through Nov. 6, said the recent Jericho March on Saturday, Oct. 15, with 55 participants of all ages, was proof of the power of a peaceful, prayerful approach.\n\u201cBecause prayer is our focus, God\u2019s will was done as we walked seven times in silent prayer around the block of Planned Parenthood,\u201d Cox said. \u201cNo matter what the chaos and noise is in our culture of death, we who follow Jesus must stand firm proclaiming the truth. St. John Paul II always advised us: \u2018Be Not Afraid.\u2019\n\u201cWe welcome church groups to come out to pray together. Even though Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t performing surgical abortions right now, they are aiding women to travel to states that provide abortions,\u201d she continued.\u00a0\n\u201cWe will provide women information and help them to get a free ultrasound and guidance from Muliere Care, the most loving and helpful mobile pregnancy care center in our city,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThey provide assistance for women who have minimal support networks and are facing crisis or unplanned pregnancies.\u201d\nThe 40 Days for Life Fall Campaign kicked off with an evening Mass held jointly with students from University Catholic campus ministry. Volunteers signed up to pray outside the Planned Parenthood clinic on Dr. D.B. Todd Jr. Boulevard between 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday beginning Sept. 28. Other special events included the Jericho March, and the group will end the campaign with the praying of the rosary and Mass beginning at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 5, at St. Mary of the Seven Sorrows Church in downtown Nashville.\nIn the meantime, volunteers are still welcome to sign up for prayer hours, Cox said.\n\u201cBecause of the blessed news of the overturning of Roe v. Wade sending decisions back to the individual states, Tennessee is pro-life and pro-family. So our 40 Days for Life was more subdued in numbers on the sidewalk as we have been praying in thanksgiving to our Lord for his great mercy,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe pray that our state will continue to be pro-life.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile the number of participants has diminished this fall because of the news, there are more than 350 followers on the 40 Days for Life Facebook page, so people are definitely praying together,\u201d Cox said.\nFor more information or to sign up to pray, visit 40daysforlife.com/Nashville. Cox is encouraging anyone interested to come and pray as well as \u201cbring your guardian angel and a friend.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPreviousChrist the King cleans up in Nashville Scene Readers\u2019 Poll \n\n\n\n\nNextSt. Edward parishioners recall 70 years of family, love during anniversary celebrations [Photo Gallery]Next \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our email list\nKeep your finger on the pulse of Catholic life in Middle Tennessee by subscribing to the weekday\nE-Register here.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSt. Mary\u2019s Bookstore a stop on Fontanini Tour\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 27, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNashvilleCatholic.org: a robust choir\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 20, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAquinas College alumnus Col.
