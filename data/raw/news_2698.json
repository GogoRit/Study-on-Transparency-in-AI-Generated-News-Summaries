Anthony List and Missouri-based Choose Life Marketing. The Susan B. Anthony List ads were rejected from Facebook on the basis of a draft \"fact check\" from the anti-Trump news site The Dispatch, while Choose Life Marketing had its ad distribution privileges abruptly suspended with no policy explanation from Facebook.\nSenator Hawley wrote, \"Facebook\u2019s censors have apparently been busy this week. Your company\u2019s decision to restrict the spread of a story reporting on corruption allegations surrounding Hunter Biden is now a matter of national news and the subject of congressional inquiries. That makes it all the more inexplicable\u2014or, perhaps, all the more frustratingly predictable\u2014that Facebook would choose this same week to target pro-life content on its platform.\"\nThis week Senator Hawley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, called on Facebook and Twitter CEOs to testify on potential violations of federal election law in their censorship of the New York Post\u2019s reporting on Hunter Biden.\nRead the full letter here or below.\n\nOctober 16, 2020\nMark Zuckerberg\nChief Executive Officer\nFacebook, Inc.\n1 Hacker Way\nMenlo Park, CA 94025\nDear Mr. Zuckerberg:\nFacebook\u2019s censors have apparently been busy this week. Your company\u2019s decision to restrict the spread of a story reporting on corruption allegations surrounding Hunter Biden is now a matter of national news and the subject of congressional inquiries. That makes it all the more inexplicable\u2014or, perhaps, all the more frustratingly predictable\u2014that Facebook would choose this same week to target pro-life content on its platform.\nFirst, Choose Life Marketing\u2014a Missouri-based advertising agency doing business with crisis pregnancy centers throughout the country\u2014saw its ad distribution privileges abruptly suspended, without any explanation for what Facebook policy had allegedly been violated. When Choose Life Marketing sought to appeal that decision, they were informed that it might take \u201cweeks\u201d before Facebook could provide an explanation. Given the centrality of online advertising to businesses trying to make ends meet during the pandemic, Facebook\u2019s insouciance is unacceptable: a weeks-long blackout risks having a crippling impact on both Choose Life Marketing and its clients.\nSecond, the Susan B. Anthony List\u2014one of the nation\u2019s most prominent pro-life groups\u2014had its ads rejected by Facebook on the basis of a draft \u201cfact check\u201d from the anti-Trump news site The Dispatch. These ads described Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as supporting abortion up until the moment of birth, at taxpayer expense.[1] But the draft \u201cfact check\u201d used to \u201cdiscredit\u201d the ads acknowledged that \u201cBiden\u2019s views on abortion have evolved throughout the years,\u201d culminating in a 2012 denial of any governmental \u201cright to tell other people that . . . they can\u2019t control their body,\u201d and that Harris backed legislation that would \u201cremove state restrictions on abortions.\u201d[2] Additionally, the \u201cfact check\u201d observed that both Biden and Harris support repealing the Hyde Amendment, which presently bars federal funding for abortions.[3] The Susan B. Anthony List ads, in other words, are not false\u2014as The Dispatch itself noted when it backtracked on its own \u201cfact check.\u201d[4] Voters may disagree about the specific implications of Biden and Harris\u2019s remarks on abortion\u2014but Facebook has no business intervening in that political debate by privileging one interpretation over others.\nAll of this, no doubt, is part of an increasingly troubling pattern: it has become abundantly clear that Facebook is targeting voices that dissent from the national media\u2019s progressive consensus. Suppressing distribution of the New York Post\u2019s reporting on the Hunter Biden corruption allegations, it appears, was just the beginning.\nI look forward to learning more from you in the coming weeks, when you are under oath in a congressional hearing, about how these advertising takedown decisions were made.\nSincerely,\nJosh Hawley\nUnited States Senator\n\n\nIssues\n\nAbortion\nBig Tech\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Updates\n\nFirst Name\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\nEmail\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nCape Girardeau555 Independence Street, #1600Cape Girardeau, MO 63703Office: 573-334-5995Fax: 573-334-5947Columbia1123 Wilkes Blvd, Suite 220Columbia, MO 65201Office: 573-554-1919Fax: 573-256-1805Kansas City400 E. 9th Street, Suite 9350Kansas City, MO 64106Office: 816-960-4694Fax: 816-472-6812Springfield901 E.
