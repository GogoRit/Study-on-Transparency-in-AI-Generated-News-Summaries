Brian Stewart, R-Ashland. Photo from the Ohio House.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying that a journalist\u2019s job is to always search for the truth, and a politician\u2019s job is to never give the game away.\nAshville Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart made every Ohio journalist\u2019s job a little easier Wednesday after giving the game away regarding his attack on Ohio voters\u2019 power to amend our state constitution.\nIn league with Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose on a proposal to raise the threshold for amendments from 50% to 60%, they\u2019ve postured since Nov. 17 that this attack on voters has nothing to do with things like abortion care rights or gerrymandering reform, as has been proposed for future ballots.\nThey\u2019ve said instead that this is ostensibly about protecting the Ohio Constitution long-term from \u201cout-of-state special interests.\u201d\nStewart claimed in testimony that setting this standard was about \u201clooking ahead decades,\u201d not to 2023, and that this is about \u201ccurtailing the ability of special interests to buy amendments to benefit themselves first, and the public a distant second.\u201d\nAsked by reporters if the effort was tied to abortion and redistricting, Stewart said, \u201cI can\u2019t control suspicion in this building,\u201d and, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to control conspiracy theory or folks that want to imply impure motives.\u201d\nStewart told fellow House Republicans something quite different in a letter obtained by Cleveland.com\u2019s Andrew J. Tobias:\n\n\n        \u201c1. After decades of Republicans\u2019 work to make Ohio a pro-life state, the Left intends to write abortion on demand into Ohio\u2019s Constitution. If they succeed, all the work we accomplished by multiple Republican majorities will be undone\u2026\u201d Stewart wrote, and later notes that HJR 6 has the full support of Ohio Right to Life and the Center for Christian Virtue.\n\nAs his second numbered bullet point, he writes:\n\n\n        \u201c2. Despite enduring a year-long circus in the Ohio Supreme Court, Republicans won a 67 seat majority in the House in 2022. Unable to win a statewide election, Democrats now intend to rewrite Ohio\u2019s Constitution to put (retiring Republican Chief Justice) Maureen O\u2019Connor and other unelected liberals in charge of drawing legislative districts, affecting not only the Ohio legislature, but control of the United States House of Representatives as well. That\u2019s just in 2023.\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s own two bullet points are precisely abortion and gerrymandering. There is no third.\nGiving testimony, Stewart derided special interests benefiting themselves first and the public a distant second.\nIn private, Stewart is exhorting his fellow Republicans explicitly to benefit themselves and their special interest lobbyist friends first, and the public a distant second.\nIn fact, Stewart provides an intricate break-down of his own special interest supporters:\n\n\n        \u201cHJR6 is supported by Ohio Right to Life, the Center for Christian Virtue (CCV), the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Business Roundtable. We anticipate that once they work through their internal processes that The Buckeye Institute and NFIB will be proponents as well. I spoke to (Affiliated Construction Trades Ohio Executive Director) Matt Szollosi with the building trades union last week, and he confirmed they are neutral on the resolution. The handful of public sector unions that oppose HJR6 have aligned themselves with the Left\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the Ohio Business Roundtable said the same day in a tweet, \u201cThe Ohio Business Roundtable has not taken a position with HRJ6. This memo does not accurately convey our organization\u2019s position on this legislation.\u201d\nStewart concludes the letter by saying, \u201cIf we cannot pass HJR6 now, I hope you will seriously consider the consequences of inaction, and support this resolution in January as we begin the 135th General Assembly.\u201d\nWhy is January important? The new legislature has to pass it before February in order to get it on the ballot in a \u201csleepy May primary,\u201d as Stewart calls them.\nEven though LaRose specifically denied that abortion or any other specific proposal is motivating him, these targets of protecting extremist abortion bans and gerrymandering were obvious from the beginning.\nRepublicans including LaRose have spent the last year lawlessly defying the state\u2019s highest court, the rule of law, the voters, and the Ohio Constitution, to give themselves a fresh 67-32 unconstitutionally gerrymandered supermajority in the Ohio House, and a 26-7 supermajority in the Ohio Senate.\nIn September, redistricting reform advocates said they are looking to bring a new citizen-initiative to the ballot.\nOn Nov. 8, citizens protected access to abortion health care with 59% in Kansas, 52% in Kentucky, 56% in Michigan, and 52% in Montana.\nOn Nov. 10,\u00a0abortion rights advocates said they are planning a ballot initiative to protect reproductive health care.\nOn Nov. 17, LaRose and Stewart announced their plan to make Ohio\u2019s threshold 60%.\nOn Nov. 30, more than 140 groups representing voters, teachers, the faith community, and good government voiced their opposition.\nOn Dec. 8, one organization \u2014 a Florida-based special interest group with ties to ALEC that\u2019s promoted this same amendment change in Arkansas previously, as well as election restrictions in Pennsylvania,\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Iowa, and\u00a0Kansas \u2014 had an in-state visiting fellow testify in support. He warned against \u201cout-of-state special interests.\u201d\nOn Dec. 13, hundreds of Ohioans demonstrated at the Ohio Statehouse by symbolically casting ballots against HJR 6.\nIn his Dec. 14 letter to fellow Republicans, Stewart called the demonstration a \u201ctemper tantrum.\u201d\nIt seems, whether it\u2019s warning about \u201cout-of-state special interests\u201d or exploiting \u201csleepy May primaries\u201d for low turnout to pass fundamental changes to the constitution, or benefitting yourself first and \u201cputting the public a distant second,\u201d every accusation from Stewart is an admission.\nNevertheless, I salute Stewart. I salute him for falling ass-backwards into confirming that extremist minority viewpoints on abortion care access, and illegal Republican gerrymandering, really are what this is all about.\nThis is why he wants to push Ohioans to relinquish our majority voter power and submit to minority constitutional rule.\nIt\u2019s good for us to know that truth.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXOhio Rep.
