Law takes effect Sept. 15Lauren Chapman & Violet Comber-Wilen Article origination IPB NewsIndiana lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban on Aug. 5, which Gov. Eric Holcomb signed into law quickly after.Ben Thorp/WBAA\r\n\tIndiana lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban on Aug. 5, which Gov. Eric Holcomb signed into law quickly after. The ACLU and several abortion care providers are challenging the new law in court, but unless it is halted, the ban will take effect Sept. 15.\n\r\n\tWe asked members of the Indiana Two-Way for their questions about the ban. To join the Indiana Two-Way, text \u201cIndiana\u201d to 73224.\n\r\n\tWhat does the law do?\u00a0\n\r\n\tThe law bans abortion in Indiana, with a few, narrow exceptions.\n\r\n\tAbortions would only be allowed if the pregnant person\u2019s serious health or life is at risk; if there\u2019s a lethal fetal anomaly up to 20 weeks post-fertilization; and in cases of rape or incest, but only up to 10 weeks.\n\r\n\tIt also limits abortion to only hospitals and surgical centers owned by hospitals \u2013 and specifically bans abortion clinics.\n\nWill the ban affect access to contraceptives and emergency contraceptives?\n\r\n\tDuring testimony on the measure, Sen. Sue Glick (R-LaGrange) emphasized contraceptives and emergency contraceptives like Plan B would not be banned by this bill.\n\r\n\tHowever, the legislation signed into law leaves much of this promise up in the air, said Jennifer Drobac, an Indiana University law professor.\n\r\n\tShe said that language in the law could \u201cconceivably\u201d outlaw certain forms of birth control, including IUDs, that can interfere with the implantation process.\n\r\n\t\u201cThe problem with all of this is, how is a normal human being, person who's pregnant, supposed to know whether or not they're taking a medication or using a contraception that is actually prohibited \u2013 because they honestly think that what they're doing is OK, and, under the law, is not prohibited,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tShe added this vague language leaves room for interpretation. Drobac said the law does not go far enough in detailing what is acceptable, leaving contraceptive users potentially vulnerable to accidentally doing something illegal.\n\r\n\t\u201cSo that's the problem with the Indiana law, is it's dealing in an area of science that is sophisticated, with law that is not sophisticated,\u201d Drobac said.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t abortion restrictions decided by a ballot question in Indiana?\n\r\n\tA lot of Hoosiers wanted to know why there\u2019s not a public question about abortion on the ballot this November \u2013 especially after a high-profile Kansas referendum in early August.\n\r\n\tBallot questions (other than school funding referendums) are fairly rare in Indiana. There is no legal avenue for what\u2019s known as a \u201ccitizen-led\u201d initiative \u2013 for instance, gathering enough signatures to put a question on the ballot.\n\r\n\tStill, there\u2019s nothing in state law stopping legislators from creating one on abortion. But House and Senate Republicans rejected efforts from Democrats to do so.\n\r\n\tSenate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray (R-Martinsville) said that crafting such a question is difficult.\n\r\n\t\u201cCould you say \u2013 should abortion be legal? Should it be legal for the first trimester?\u201d Bray said. \u201cShould abortion be illegal with exception of the life of the mother, or the life and health of the mother, or the life and health of the mother and rape and incest? And if you say rape and incest or life of the mother, how do you define life of the mother?\u201d\n\nHow will Indiana\u2019s abortion law affect medications that treat other conditions like lupus?\n\r\n\tJody Madeira is a law professor at Indiana University Bloomington. She said this new law may affect access to these medications.\n\r\n\t\u201cPharmacists have to honor all prescriptions, but they are immune from criminal prosecution or civil liability if they refuse to honor prescriptions because in their professional judgment, it would be contrary to the law or a patient's health and safety are against the patient's best interests,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tShe said in some states, women have been refused medication treating conditions like arthritis.\n\r\n\tIn Indiana, pharmacists are typically expected to prescribe as the doctor ordered. But a 2019 law expanded protections for medical professionals who object to abortion on \u201cethical, moral, or religious grounds\u201d to refuse to participate in abortions, to include pharmacists who refuse to dispense abortion-inducing drugs.\n\r\n\t\u201cThere's nowhere in the abortion bill where it addresses pharmacists, refusals. Nor does it necessarily give pharmacists leave explicitly in the bill to sign off on prescriptions for abortion medication,\u201d she said.\n\nHow are hospitals preparing for the law taking effect?\u00a0\n\r\n\tDr. David Ingram is IU\u2019s Health chief medical officer. He said IU Health, Indiana\u2019s largest health care system, has spent the past few months deciding how to best provide support for health care providers.\n\r\n\t\u201cAll of our sites are prepared for that and we\u2019re determining what\u2019s the best access point, based on a number of factors for our patients seeking care,\u201d Ingram said.\n\r\n\tIngram said the cost of abortion in Indiana will increase due to the ban.\n\r\n\tMaternal-fetal medicine specialist Dr. Caroline Rouse said IU Health has also created a 24-7 rapid response team that\u2019s prepared to answer provider questions about what they are allowed to do under the ban.\n\r\n\t\u201cSo, in the event that a health care provider has an urgent legal question related to provision of abortion services, the rapid response team can be called for an opinion and advice,\u201d Rouse said.\n\r\n\tThe hospital will continue to provide legal abortion care through this response team, and by monitoring the impact of the abortion ban on infant and maternal mortality rates in the country.\n\nWill the ban lead to more people and businesses leaving Indiana?\n\r\n\tThe morning after Governor Holcomb signed a near-total abortion ban into law, one of the state\u2019s largest employers said the new restrictions will hinder its ability to attract talent.\n\r\n\t\u201cGiven this new law, we will be forced to plan for more employment growth outside our home state,\u201d pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, said in a statement.\n\r\n\tThe statement was the first comment Eli Lilly, which employs more than 10,400 people in Indianapolis, has made on the legislation.\n\r\n\tCummins spoke out the same day Eli Lilly issued its statement to oppose the ban. Both companies said the ban will make it hard to attract talent, and they will consider growth in other states.\n\r\n\t\u201cFor Cummins to be successful it is critical that we have a safe and welcoming workplace, and communities where we embrace our differences and enable all employees to thrive,\u201d the Cummins statement said. \u201cAs we continue to grow our footprint with a focus on selecting communities that align with our values and business goals, this law will be considered in our decision-making process.\u201d\n\nUnlike many smaller companies in Indiana, both Cummins and Eli Lilly were publicly silent until after the decision was passed.\n\r\n\tButHolcomb largely dismissed any impact Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban will have on attracting and retaining businesses and talent to the state.\n\r\n\tThe governor insisted the state is well-positioned to continue adding jobs and investments.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s because of access to talent,\u201d Holcomb said. \u201cAnd we have that access to talent \u2013 we had it yesterday, we have it today and we\u2019ll have it tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nJoin the conversation and sign up for the Indiana Two-Way.

Your comments and questions in response to our weekly text help us find the answers you need on statewide issues.\n\n\nWhere do the majority of Hoosiers stand on abortion?\n\r\n\tLaura Wilson is a University of Indianapolis associate professor of political science. She said getting an answer on abortion from polling is difficult as there\u2019s often a disconnect between opinion and action when it comes to polling.\n\r\n\t\u201cMany people will say generally speaking, they support something,\" Wilson said. \"Will they vote on the basis of that? Will they write their legislator on the basis of that? Will they go to protest on the basis of that?\u201d\n\r\n\tOn abortion polling specifically, Wilson said it\u2019s a particularly tricky issue to gauge public opinion on.\n\r\n\t\u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of parameters and a lot of exceptions, explanations, context that you can add to it,\" Wilson said. \"It\u2019s not as simple as we often make it feel, where you\u2019re either in support of it or against it.\u201d\n\r\n\tWhat little Indiana public polling about abortion there is available suggests a large majority of Hoosiers support at least some legal access to abortion \u2013 but exactly how much access is harder to gauge.\n\r\n\tLawmakers also passed a companion measure to put more money toward adoption and family supports. How adequate is the funding?\n\nThe package includes more than $70 million to help address services and programs for pregnant Hoosiers, families and children. That includes increasing the state adoption tax credit to $2,500 per child (up from $1,000) and ensuring Hoosiers no longer have to pay sales tax on children's diapers.\n\r\n\tMonique Kulkarni is a licensed psychologist with Valley Oaks Health, a community mental health center. During testimony on the bill, she said she supports the funding the bill puts toward various maternal health services \u2013 but she said it\u2019s not enough.\n\r\n\t\u201cA one-time allocation of funds, when Indiana ranks third in maternal mortality and 43rd in prevalence of mental illness and access to care, won\u2019t even be a drop in the bucket for the many agencies referenced in this bill,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tIUPUI professor Erin Macey has been studying financial support for pregnant Hoosiers.\n\r\n\t\u201cIndiana has a $6 billion surplus and what you\u2019ve proposed to spend on support for moms and babies in SB 2 represents less than 1 percent of that surplus,\" Macey said. \"Mothers are the foundation of our society and this does not show them that they are valued.\u201d\n\r\n\tOne study through the Indiana University Richard Fairbanks School of Public Health titled \u201cAsk the Women\u201d spoke to people in zip codes with high infant mortality rates in an effort to understand where they experienced gaps in care.\n\r\n\tMacy is a senior researcher for the Grassroots and Maternal Child Health Initiative, which oversees the study. She said a vast majority of the participants in the study worked over the course of their pregnancy. Roughly half of the participants experienced \u201csignificant interruptions\u201d in their ability to do work.\n\r\n\t\u201cMany of our participants were pushed out of work,\u201d she said. \u201cEither because they couldn\u2019t receive really basic accommodations and have bathroom breaks or go to prenatal visits.\u201d\n\r\n\tSen. Ryan Mishler (R-Bremen) called the bill \u201cbridge funding\u201d meant to help the state get through the next several months until lawmakers write a new state budget next year.\n\nThe family supports law includes credits, exemptions for adoption. Will it affect the process?\n\r\n\tMeg Sterchi is the executive director of Adoptions of Indiana, a nonprofit offering various education and support services for birth parents and adoptive families.\n\r\n\t\u201cI think that it's good that Indiana is increasing services, well, money, to provide more services to women who are pregnant. But I think we're just scratching the top of what is needed if we really want to help women who are pregnant,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tOne of the bill\u2019s major changes was raising the adoption tax credit from $1,000 to $2,500.\n\r\n\tSterchi said this price change will \u201cnot make a big difference.\u201d She said she feels the scope of this legislation should\u2019ve gone further to support pregnant people.\n\r\n\tShannon Schumacher is the president and CEO of the Villages of Indiana, the state\u2019s largest not-for-profit child and family services agency.\n\r\n\tWhile she is hopeful that adoption tax credits could encourage others to adopt, she said other issues can arise post-adoption, including limited attention on the well-being of birth mothers.\n\r\n\t\u201cOftentimes, with the birth mother, there's lots of attention on her during her pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut once the child is adopted, we know that oftentimes the support for the birth mother wanes at that point. So to make sure that there's continued support for those birth mothers after the baby is adopted [is important].\u201d\n\r\n\tHow will the ban affect doctors hoping to train or work in Indiana?\n\r\n\tIndiana, like many Republican-led states, has a shortage of providers. A 2018 report from the March of Dimes found 27 percent of Indiana counties are considered maternal care deserts, with no or limited access to maternity care. The state has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country.\n\r\n\tDr. Wendy Tian, a third year resident, said lately she is scared and worried about her safety. Tian grew up and went to school in Chicago and chose to come to Indiana for residency because the program has a strong family planning focus. She was also open to practicing in Indiana once she completes her training.\n\nBut that\u2019s changed.\n\r\n\t\u201cI always thought I wanted to do family planning. I'm now thinking about doing something else,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I still want to incorporate it. But I, for sure, don't know if I would be able to stay in Indiana postgraduation with what's going on.\u201d\n\r\n\tStill, she feels \u201cguilty for giving up\u201d on some of the most vulnerable patients in Indiana.\n\r\n\tEven before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Tian said the medical climate in Indiana could be hostile and frustrating. Indiana, like other states with abortion restrictions, allows nearly all health care providers to opt-out of providing care for abortion patients.\n\nThis story came in response to a listener's question.
