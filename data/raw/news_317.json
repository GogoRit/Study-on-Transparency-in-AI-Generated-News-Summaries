Protesters have been demanding a meeting with the head of government, Mateusz Morawiecki.\nVideo emerged of clashes with police during the day. Then, overnight, police began further interventions, detaining 37 of the protesters and dismantling their camp. Among those detained was Pawe\u0142 Tanajno, a minor candidate in this year\u2019s presidential elections and one of the organisers of the protest.\n\n\nTak wyglada frustracja przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w.

They also want salaries in public administration reduced, and the health minister to resign.\nThe government has already introduced a series of measures to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the economy from lockdown, as well as to support businesses, workers and the financial sector during the crisis. But the protesters argue it is insufficient, and many fear they are facing bankruptcy.\n\u201cThe assistance is a fiction,\u201d one protester told RMF24. \u201cThe \u2018unfreezing\u2019 scheme doesn\u2019t cover my industry at all. We filed the applications [for state support], but we can\u2019t get in touch with the officials, they don\u2019t answer their phones. We\u2019re left with practically nothing.\u201d\nThe protest was organised through social media by a group called Strajk Przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w (Strike of Business Owners), and protesters began to gather yesterday at 4 p.m. in the centre of Warsaw.\nFirst they blocked a busy roundabout with their cars, beeping horns in protest. This was a means of avoiding violating Poland\u2019s current lockdown restrictions (one also recently used by women protesting against a proposed abortion ban).\nHowever, they later began to engage in street protests, walking towards parliament and the prime minister\u2019s office. Participants shouted \u201clayabouts\u201d, \u201csellouts\u201d, \u201cwe will swap Morawiecki for dollars\u201d, and \u201cwe are the Poles\u201d, reports Polityka, a news weekly.\nPolice observing the demonstration pointed out that many were not wearing obligatory face masks. They were also not keeping to social distancing requirements and ignored police commands to obey the law.\n\n\nProtest przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w w Warszawie.

Police began to intervene around 1 a.m., reports Gazeta Wyborcza. As a result, 37 participants were arrested and further 150 asked for their identity documents.\n\u201cDuring the nighttime protest all safety rules were broken,\u201d stated the police. \u201cMany of the restrictions imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus were violated, and the behaviour of the protesters can be described as extremely disrespectful.\u201d\n\n\nW przypadku nocnego protestu mamy do czynienia z bezwzgl\u0119dnym \u0142amaniem wszelkich zasad bezpiecze\u0144stwa.

Among those present are Janusz Korwin-Mikke and Grzegorz Braun, both MPs and leaders of the far-right Confederation party.\n\n\nProtest przedsi\u0119biorc\u00f3w Grzegorz Braun, Janusz Korwin-Mikke https://t.co/anqq0CqsVW przez @YouTube\n\u2014 Roland Zalewski (@Zalewski53) May 8, 2020\n\nMain image credit: Grzegorz Celejewski / Agencja Gazeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgnieszka W\u0105do\u0142owskaAgnieszka W\u0105do\u0142owska is deputy editor of Notes from Poland.
