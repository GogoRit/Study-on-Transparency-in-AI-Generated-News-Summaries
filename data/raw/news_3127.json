LEAVEN PHOTO BY MARC ANDERSONby Marc and Julie Andersonmjanderson@theleaven.orgTOPEKA \u2014 Amazing. Inspirational. Powerful. Moving.That\u2019s how four archdiocesan eighth graders described the Ignite Rally and Mass for Life held Jan. 25 at Topeka\u2019s Performing Arts Center.The annual event drew an estimated 1,500 students ranging from middle school to college age from around the state and featured remarks by Debra Niesen, the archdiocesan pro-life consultant; an opening prayer by Father Mark Ostrowski, chaplain of St. James Academy in Lenexa; Mass celebrated by the Kansas bishops; and a video featuring a woman sharing her story of how Advice & Aid Pregnancy Centers helped her to choose life for her now-7-week-old child.The day\u2019s activities also included a talk by Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, an organization founded in 2006 with nearly 1,300 chapters on high school and college campuses across the country. Its signature \u201cI Am the Pro-Life Generation\u201d signs can be spotted at nearly every single pro-life march.Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, served as the keynote speaker for a crowd of approximately 1,500 students ranging from middle school to college age. LEAVEN PHOTO BY MARC ANDERSONIn her talk, Hawkins described her journey from uninvolved teenager to president of a national organization.\u201cI simply said yes to an opportunity that was presented to me when I was 15 years old to volunteer at a women\u2019s health center in my community,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time it was a pro-life pregnancy resource center.\u201dThat day, Hawkins said, changed her life.At the time, she wanted to work at NASA and was planning on earning a degree in aeronautical engineering.\u201cI was going places, and then everything changed because I learned what was happening,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat was happening 2,363 times every single day inside Planned Parenthood and other abortion facilities. And my question immediately was: \u2018Why isn\u2019t anyone saying anything? Why aren\u2019t there protests in the streets? Why is it that when I go to church every Sunday this isn\u2019t the first thing we talk about? How is this not coming up in my school? Where is the outrage? Why are they not talking about on the news every single night?\u2019\u201dAlmost immediately, Hawkins started a pro-life group at her high school.\u201cEverything in my life changed because I had said yes to one opportunity that was presented to me. A passion was ignited inside of me,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou never know how God is going to use your \u2018yes\u2019 \u2014 how God is going to use your willingness to speak for the most vulnerable.\u201dArchbishop Joseph F. Naumann, joined by Bishop Gerald Vincke of the Diocese of Salina, and Bishop Carl Kemme of the Diocese of Wichita, and numerous priests from across the state, celebrates the annual votive Mass as part of the Ignite Rally and Mass for Life held Jan. 25 at the Topeka Performing Arts Center. LEAVEN PHOTO BY MARC ANDERSONElsewhere in her talk, Hawkins discussed three action steps every person can take to \u201cmake abortion unavailable and unthinkable.\u201dThe first step, she said, is to see in your mind what an America without abortion looks like.\u201cTo see is a dangerous thing,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause once you see what our nation could look like when no child is deemed unworthy, when no one says it\u2019s just better to abort this child, then you\u2019re going to have to do something more.\u201dThe next step, Hawkins said, is to speak about abortion, but one cannot stop there either.\u201cAfter you begin to speak about abortion and you speak out, next you have to serve. What are you doing to serve?\u201d Hawkins asked. \u201cAs we prepare for a nation without Roe, we must do our part to ensure that every single woman knows the resources available to her.\u201dEven though there are more than 2,000 pregnancy resource centers across the nation, Hawkins noted that eight out of 10 people do not know where they are within their own communities.Closing her remarks, Hawkins read from the First Chapter of St. Paul\u2019s Letter to Timothy, instructing the youth to heed its advice.\u201cDo not be timid or fearful. Do not have cowardice. You are in the world\u2019s greatest human rights movement,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are part of a pro-life generation that will become the first post-Roe generation. You are part of history that\u2019s going to do something that hasn\u2019t been done for over 50 years in our country when we send Roe v. Wade back to the ashes of history, when we work state by state to make abortion unthinkable and illegal.\u201dAmong those hearing Hawkins\u2019 presentation were Joey Geier and Madison Kamer of Christ the King School in Topeka, and Jenna Henkensiefken and John-Patrick Ayella, both of Mater Dei School, also in Topeka.Describing the day as \u201cmoving,\u201d Ayella said he could \u201cdefinitely feel the atmosphere\u201d and he\u2019s going to \u201cspeak up more about abortion,\u201d while Henkensiefken called the day \u201cpowerful.\u201dKamer, likewise, found the day \u201cinspirational,\u201d and said she was especially touched by the woman featured in the video.\u201cShe just looked to get help,\u201d Kamer said, adding she plans to help \u201cspread the message.\u201dLike Kamer, Geier said he plans to speak up more.\u00a0\u201cAbortion is never OK. It has never been, never will be,\u201d said Geier. \u201cI think more people need to know that.\u201dFacebookXGoogle+PinterestLinkedInYou may also like\n\n \nArchdiocese \u2022 LocalBible study offers women the chance to grow in their...\n\n \nLocal \u2022 SchoolsBishop Ward kicks off $7.5 million campaign\n\n \nLocal \u2022 Youth & young adultArchbishop\u2019s Invitational honors young student artists...\n\n \nLocal \u2022 Youth & young adultMissionaries needed for summer Totus Tuus program\n\n \nLocal \u2022 Spanish ArticlesLa familia y sus miembros descubren c\u00f3mo les llama el...\n\n \nLent \u2022 LocalDevotion built on desire to follow Christ\u2019s final...About the author\nMarc & Julie AndersonFreelancers Marc and Julie Anderson are long-time contributors to the Leaven.
