Gov. Kim Reynolds immediately said in a statement she would sign the bill on Friday.The bill passed with exclusively Republican support in a rare, one-day legislative burst lasting more than 14 hours over the vocal \u2014 and sometimes tense \u2014 objections from Democratic lawmakers and abortion advocates protesting at the Capitol. Just after 11 p.m., lingering protesters in the gallery booed and yelled \u201cshame\u201d to state senators in the minutes after the bill was approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Related coverage\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFew US adults support full abortion bans, even in states that have them, an AP-NORC poll finds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne year later, the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision is both scorned and praised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year after fall of Roe, 25 million women live in states with abortion bans or tighter restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReynolds ordered the rare session after the state Supreme Court declined in June to reinstate a practically identical law that she signed in 2018.\u201cThe Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement. \u201cThe voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed.\u201d \n\nAbortion is currently legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. The legislation will take immediate effect with the governor\u2019s signature on Friday. It will prohibit almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparations were already underway to quickly file legal challenges in court and get the measure blocked, once Reynolds signs it into law.\u201cThe ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood, and the Emma Goldman Clinic remain committed to protecting the reproductive rights of Iowans to control their bodies and their lives, their health, and their safety \u2014including filing a lawsuit to block this reckless, cruel law,\u201d ACLU of Iowa Executive Director Mark Stringer said in a statement.\n\nIn the meantime, Planned Parenthood North Central States has said they will refer patients out of state if they\u2019re scheduled for abortions in the next few weeks. The organization, the largest abortion provider in the state, will continue to provide care to patients who present before cardiac activity is detected.There are limited circumstances under the measure that would allow for abortion after that point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected \u2014 such as rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality \u201cincompatible with life;\u201d and if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman.For much of the morning and afternoon, chants from abortion advocates echoed through the rotunda and could be heard from rooms where state representatives and senators were meeting in the morning and afternoon. Members of the public for and against the bill alternated conveying their viewpoints to lawmakers from both chambers for nearly four hours in total.\n\nSara Eide of the Iowa Catholic Conference encouraged lawmakers to vote in favor.\u201cThe unborn child is a distinct human life with her own value, with her own DNA, and with her own right to life and right to legal protections,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a state and as a society, we should commit ourselves to protect all vulnerable populations wherever we find them.\u201dHilary McAdoo, a fertility nurse, said her two daughters motivated her to voice her opposition Tuesday.\u201cJust because a person has the ability to become pregnant does not mean they should be forced to become a mother,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people before me want to govern women\u2019s bodies without understanding how they work.\u201dMcAdoo called the six-week cutoff \u201cimpossible and irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill shelved that sought changes to Iowa law outlining penalties for terminating a pregnancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP Player of the Week: Caitlin Clark helps Iowa win third straight Big Ten Tournament title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA century before Caitlin Clark, 6-on-6 basketball players in Iowa were blazing trail for her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws such as Iowa\u2019s ban abortion when a \u201c fetal heartbeat \u201d can be detected, a concept that does not easily translate to medical science. That\u2019s because at the point where advanced technology can detect that first visual flutter, the embryo isn\u2019t yet a fetus, and it doesn\u2019t have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy, medical experts say.\n\nA district court found the 2018 law unconstitutional in 2019 based on rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court that had affirmed a woman\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to abortion. After both bodies overturned those rulings last year, the governor sought to reinstate the 2018 law. But the state\u2019s high court deadlocked last month without ruling on the merits of an abortion ban, leaving the law permanently blocked. And so Reynolds called lawmakers back to Des Moines.Democratic lawmakers proposed amendments to the language to expand the exceptions, which were swiftly rejected.\u201cIowa women are less free than they were a week ago and it\u2019s because of the work of Republicans in the legislature and the governor,\u201d said House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, who voiced concern that there will be instant chaos and confusion if and when the bill is signed into law. \n\n\u201cWe will spend every day between now and Election Day letting voters know that the Republican Legislature was too extreme, went too far and voted against the interests of everyday Iowans,\u201d she added.Most Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
