There is expected to be a public signing ceremony with Gov. Ralph Northam in April.\nAn earlier version of the bill passed both chambers in early February.\nIn a joint statement, Virginia Bishops Michael F. Burbidge of Arlington and Barry C. Knestout of Richmond praised the lawmakers' decision to abolish the death penalty.\n\"We offer \u2014 and affirm the utmost need for \u2014 prayerful support for the families of victims of horrific crimes,\" they said. \"We also affirm, with clarity and conviction, the words of the Catechism of the Catholic Church: '(T)he death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person.'\"\nLegislation that would expand abortion coverage in Virginia's health exchange also is likely to be signed by Northam, who supports legal abortion.\nThe Virginia House of Delegates passed the bill allowing tax-funded abortion for any reason in Virginia's health exchange Jan. 26. The Senate OK'd the measure Jan. 22, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.\n\"Today, the House of Delegates made the tragic decision to expand drastically abortion coverage in Virginia's health benefits exchange,\" Burbidge and Knestout of Richmond said in a joint statement the day of the House vote. It echoed what the bishops said when the Senate passed its version.\nThe exchange is a virtual health insurance marketplace where Virginians can shop and enroll in health care plans. Taxes pay for managing it and subsidizing health care plans of tens of thousands of low- and middle-income Virginians.\n\"This legislation is identical to the bill the Senate passed that permits plans participating in the exchange to cover abortion for any reason, funded in significant part with Virginians' tax dollars,\" the bishops said Jan. 26.\n\"Replacing the current life-saving restrictions on abortion with a policy of abortion coverage without limits in our state exchange is drastic, dangerous and will result in the tragic end to more unborn lives,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMost Read Stories\n\n\n \n\n#1 New combative faith group to host 'Catholic prayer' for Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n \n\n#2 Attacking Pope Francis, anonymous cardinal seeks to curb the influence of his papacy\n \n\n#3 Here in the US, Catholicism is for sale\n \n\n#4 The Catholic Church needs married priests now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanRome biblical and Eastern institutes merged with Gregorian UniversityByCindy WoodenCatholic News Service\n \n\nNewsLife-threatening safety concerns keep Burkina Faso Catholics away from Sunday MassByTonny OnyuloOSV News\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanThe first outside legal analyses of Vatican's 'trial of the century' are in, and they're criticalByNicole WinfieldAssociated Press\n \n\nFrancis, the comic stripVaticanFrancis, the comic stripByPat Marrin\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR's Free NewslettersSelect any of the newsletters below, then enter your email address and click \"subscribe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per dayDaily Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updates: The latest news and feature articles\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Daily: (the latest articles, sent every morning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per weekWeekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Weekly: NCR staff talk music, television, books, movies and more\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Weekly: Environment editor Stephanie Clary dives into the week's climate change news\n\n\n\nMichael Sean Winters: The nexus between religion and politics\n\n\n\nNCR Book Club: Find your latest book to read\n\n\n\nScripture for Life: Reflections on the Sunday readings\n\n\n\nSunday Resources: Reflections on the readings sent two months ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x WeeklyBiweekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Francis Chronicles: Get to know the pope's pastoral side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Sections\n\n\nNCR Sections\n\n\nNews\n\n\nVatican\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSpirituality\n\n\nSunday Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Channels\n\n\nEarthBeat\n\n\nGlobal Sisters Report\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Menu\n\n\nWays to Give\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nYour NCR Legacy\n\n\nFriends & Tributes\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR\n\n\nRenew Subscription\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\nFree Newsletters\n\n\neNCR and Kindle Edition\n\n\nRequest a sample issue\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nHow to write for NCR\n\n\nLetters to Editor\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\n\nChange your address\n\n\nReprints\n\n\n\n\nAbout NCR\n\n\nMission & Values\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nStaff and Contributors\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nDonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Catholic Reporter\nFollow\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTikTok\n\n\nAdvertising Guidelines / \n  Terms of Use / \n  Privacy Policy / \n  Site Map\n/ Mailing Address: 115 E Armour Boulevard Kansas City, MO 64111 / Phone Number: +1-800-444-8910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
