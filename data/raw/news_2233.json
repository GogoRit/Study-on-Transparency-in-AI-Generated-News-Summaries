The execution spree ran roughshod over historical norms and stood entirely contrary to the decline in the practice of the death penalty that has been the trend in the US for several years.\n\nAmerican law permits the death penalty in some cases and in some states. The issue for Christians is not what the American law permits as justifiable punishment (lex talionis) but how Christians are to think about capital punishment and the death penalty.\nChristians should renounce the death penalty.\nChristians who are pro-life in all directions (abortion and war two others, but think too of health and provisions and shelter) include opposition to the death penalty as an element of being completely pro-life.\nOpposition to the death penalty is the first part: the second is establishing restorative justice.\nAs old trucks can become brand new, so criminals can find a new life.\nBut you will ask, What about the laws of Moses? Here\u2019s my argument.\nFirst, the OT clearly contains legislation about capital punishment. The famous lex talionis of Exodus 21:24 (Lev 24:20; Deut 19:21) legislated \u201can eye for an eye.\u201d The person who kills/murders a human is put to death as a just punishment. Most think the lex talionis was originally formed to curb relentless revenge, and so the law was formed to limit punishment to the degree it would compensate for the crime.\nSecond, the Cities of Refuge provided for unintentional slayers a place of refuge while waiting trial (Exod 21:12-14; Numb 35:6-34; Deut 4:41-43; 19:1-13). These Cities are near-equivalents of a prison system. There is an admission of the potential use of improper revenge written into the fabric of the Cities of Refuge They exist because the avenger was justified to put murderers to death. The Cities prevented avengers from meeting out \u201cinjustice.\u201d\nI conclude from these two sets of evidence that the death penalty is legislated in the Torah and that the death penalty is understood in the Bible as just. I see no reason to pretend that the Torah is barbaric: there is logical force in \u201chuman for human.\u201d I also conclude that the laws of Moses knew the problem of relentless revenge and fought for just punishments.\nBut, there are other considerations for the Christian who wants to walk in the Way of Jesus. His Way is the Way of the Cross.\nA question first, this one from Katherine Sonderegger: \u201cIs Holiness, or Absolute Power, only divine if it is tempered \u2013 or even overcome, superseded \u2013 by saving Goodness?\u201d (Systematic Theology 1).\nThird, Jesus clearly undermines the lex talionis. Not because Jesus didn\u2019t believe in justice, or that the death penalty was unjust. Here\u2019s what Jesus says in Matthew 5:38-42:\n\nYou have heard that it was said, \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.\n\nThe Torah of Moses specified justifiable revenge; Jesus contends that his followers are to extend grace.\nHe knows what justice permits and legislates; he just doesn\u2019t think that is the way to proceed for his community of faith.\n\nFor Jesus the lex talionis may be a form of just punishment, but among his followers there will not be the pursuit of revenge. There will be another Way. As I point out in The Sermon on the Mount, what was \u201cshow no mercy\u201d in the Torah under Jesus becomes an opportunity to show mercy.\nFourth, forgiveness is a notable emphasis of Jesus, of his followers, and of the Christian faith. Our faith teaches that whatever has been done by any human being in history, today, and in the future has been absorbed by the Cross and forgiven.\nForgiven people are to become agents of forgiveness by God\u2019s grace. In Jesus Creed, chp. 23, I explain that forgiveness, or at least the emphasis given to it, takes a path that the Judaism of Jesus\u2019 day was not prepared to take. Jesus and the early Christians sensed this shift: they were to create an alternative community, one not marked by a justice system of offense and retributive, undifferentiated punishment, but of offense and redemption that promotes forgiveness leading to restoration through repentance. Hence, the Way of the Cross reveals a restorative justice that goes beyond retributive justice.\nGrace and forgiveness unleash the power of God that re-makes humans. That is the Way of Jesus, the Way of the Cross.\nFifth, the system of embracing grace in the Bible sabotages the secular system of justice. God\u2019s love for us restores us by forgiving us. God\u2019s grace is a system in which revenge is denied and punishment absorbed. Cracked Eikons are restored by Christ to be glory-producing Eikons as a result of this gospel. The heart of the Christian gospel is the belief that all humans are made in God\u2019s image.\nAnd herein lies the reason why I think Christians ought to oppose the death penalty. Not because the death penalty is unfair, or it doesn\u2019t work, or because it is too hard to prove someone guilty, or because it costs too much \u2014 these are all pragmatic reasons with some merit, but not enough as far as I\u2019m concerned.\nThe reason Christians should oppose the death penalty is because they believe that (1) humans are Eikons of God who, because of the redemptive work of the trinitarian God in the Cross, Resurrection, and Pentecost, (2) can be restored to union with God and communion with others, and (3) those who are restored are Agents of Grace in this world.\nChristians can oppose the death penalty because they have hope and believe that God\u2019s grace can undo what has been done and remake the criminal into a person he or she was not previously.\nI do think life imprisonment is just, but I see no reason to go any further than that: of course, it is perhaps not \u201cjust\u201d to keep someone alive who has murdered another human, but the system of grace taught by Jesus deconstructs the system of justice by taking it to an entirely new level. These are Eikons we are talking about, not simply Perpetrator X vs. Victim Y before Judge Z.\nPerhaps time and efforts on our part will lead Perpetrator X to the sort of honesty before God, the Ultimate Judge Z, that discovers that God\u2019s redemptive work can make murderers anew.\nThe Apostle Paul is a good example.\nWe should write to our senators to oppose the death penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks & ResourcesA Church Called Tov: Forming a Goodness Culture That Resists Abuses of Power and Promotes HealingLaura Barringer; Scot McKnight\nTyndale Elevate2020-10-06256 pp., 16.49\n\nView More\n\nFree NewslettersSign up to receive monthly updates from Jesus Creed delivered to your inbox:\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\n\nJesus Creed is a part of CT's \r\n\tBlog Forum.
