I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know that abortion even had a smell?\u201d\nJohnson, 39, quit working at a clinic in Bryan, Texas, more than a decade ago after, she claimed, witnessing the abortion of a woman who was 13-weeks pregnant. Reporters have cast doubt on her story over the years, citing a lack of documentation, but she stands by it.\n\u201cNothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen: an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I saw was a spine twirling around in the mother\u2019s womb before succumbing to the force of the suction.\u201d\nJohnson now runs And Then There Were None, a group that urges abortion clinic employees to leave, which she founded in 2012.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRNC 2020\n\n\n\n\t\tEx-Democratic mayor says mining town 'lost hope' until Trump\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer life story was the basis for \u201cUnplanned,\u201d a popular, yet controversial, anti-abortion movie released last year.\nIn a recent podcast interview, Johnson said she was honored to have been asked to speak at the RNC and said she wanted to make the most of her five-minute address.\n\u201cI felt a lot of pressure to make the most provocative, impassioned, memorable pro-life \u2026 speech ever made,\u201d she said on \u201cThe Church Boys Podcast.\u201d\nJohnson added that she likes \u201cshocking people out of their apathy and into action.\u201d\nShe and her husband, Doug Johnson, live in Texas with their eight children, including Jude, a boy the couple adopted at birth in 2015.\nJohnson took some heat on Twitter earlier Tuesday after Vice News resurfaced a YouTube video the pro-lifer posted in June and later made private. The clip was first reported on by The Daily Caller shortly after it was published.\nIn the video, Johnson said it would be \u201csmart\u201d for police to racially profile her adopted son, adding that \u201cstatistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.\u201d\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRNC 2020\n\n\n\n\t\tRand Paul says choose Trump, not Biden, 'if you hate war' in RNC 2020 speech\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, Jude is an adorable, perpetually tan-looking little brown boy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut one day, he\u2019s going to grow up and he\u2019s going to be a tall, probably sort of large, intimidating-looking, maybe, brown man. And my other boys are probably gonna look like nerdy white guys.\u201d\nSome of her past remarks about gender were also unearthed, including a tweet in May that stated she would \u201csupport bringing back household voting,\u201d a policy that existed before women\u2019s suffrage which allowed only the head of a household \u2014 usually a man \u2014 to vote.\nShe stood by the remark on Tuesday.\n\u201cPro-aborts are SO scared of my speech tonight that will pull back the curtain of the barbaric reality of abortion, they are scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message,\u201d Johnson tweeted. \u201cWell, guess what??
