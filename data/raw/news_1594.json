Thus, she said, any changes should be adopted by the committee. But Cavanaugh also said making no changes makes the bill more vulnerable to a court challenge.\nRiepe argued against amending the bill, saying no matter how much it was changed, it would be challenged in court.\nThe Let Them Grow Act prompted dozens of people to flood a legislative chamber two weeks ago to testify for and against the bill.\nProponents said that minors need time to grow up before undergoing gender-altering procedures.
