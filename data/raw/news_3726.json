But he said the woman kept \u201cranting and raving\u201d and wildly waving her clipboard around.\nHarvey said he feared that Jacobson was going to hit his wife with the clipboard.\n\u201cSo without thinking, I went to club it away with the rifle and my finger was still in the trigger guard. It went off and hit her.\u201d\n\nThe gun discharged into the clipboard before striking her, prosecutors said. Jacobson denied that she ever waved her clipboard.\nMost abortions are illegal in Michigan due to a 1931 state law. The law was suspended in May and struck down earlier this week as unconstitutional.\nWith Post Wires\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\nabortion\n\n\ncrime\n\n\nmichigan\n\n\nshootings\n\n\n10/1/22 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTeen killed, another injured in shooting at high school  h...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\tTrending Now\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tin US News\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 63,420 times.\n63,420\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrump sues ABC, George Stephanopoulos for defamation after host accused him of rape in Mace interview\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 57,762 times.\n57,762\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFed-up homeowner arrested after tense standoff with squatters 'stealing' $1M house she inherited from parents\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 35,635 times.\n35,635\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLA socialite accused of conspiring with hubby, daughter to influence witnesses, jury, judge and ex-Yankee pitcher lover\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis story has been shared 30,905 times.\n30,905\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJudge invokes mom's heinous crime while sentencing her for starving baby to death while she vacationed on a beach for 10 days\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow on\n Page Six\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s bios wiped from royal family website\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKate Middleton\u2019s casual farm shop outfit pays tribute to her royal hobbies\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmma Heming celebrates \u2018pure\u2019 husband Bruce Willis\u2019 69th birthday amid dementia battle\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSee All\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tVideo\t\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSenator Ron Johnson grills Secretary Xavier Becerra over COVID-19 documents\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNow on\t\t\t\t Decider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmanda Bynes And Dan Schneider\u2019s Creepy Jacuzzi Sketch Questioned In Explosive \u2018Quiet On The Set\u2019 Documentary: \u201cA Little Odd\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhere To Watch \u2018Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV\u2019 Documentary Online\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBeat It!
