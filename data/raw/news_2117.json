Not treated as unequal to men, but as unequal to other women.\nThe fact is, many on the left want to exclude pro-life women from this year\u2019s milestone celebration of the success of the suffragists. They bristle at the thought of us having an equal claim to the women\u2019s rights movement. They equate being pro-life and female as somehow being self-hating and opposed to the full equality of women.\nTherefore, in their minds, we\u2014and the millions and millions of women around the country like us\u2014are not fully equal \u2026 to them.\nHowever, abortion is not the litmus test for feminism. If it were, then those on the left might be surprised to find out that most of the women who led the fight for suffrage would have been excluded from the movement, and women\u2019s suffrage may have eluded us to this day.\nIt\u2019s time for a little history lesson. The suffragists of the 19th and 20th centuries weren\u2019t just fighting for the right to vote, they were fighting for basic equality. They were fighting for the domestic violence victim who could only escape an abusive husband with the clothes on her back, because laws forced her to leave behind her children and even wages she had earned. They were fighting for access to higher education, the right to own property, economic freedom, the ability to enter into contracts, and other basic rights that they were so often denied.\nIt was a desperate battle that became the longest-running social movement in American history.\nWhile the early feminists fought for many things, they didn\u2019t fight for abortion. And while they fought for women to have more control over their own lives, they didn\u2019t consider taking the lives of their own children as a key to their independence. In fact, many of the early suffragists are quoted as condemning abortion and considered it an offense against women and their children.\nSuffragist Alice Paul, for example, said abortion was \u201cthe ultimate exploitation of women.\u201d\n\nIn high school, we all learned about Victoria Woodhull, who became the first female candidate for president in 1872 to raise awareness for women\u2019s suffrage. Woodhull called abortion \u201cmurder\u201d and said that women would only commit such an act when they were in a \u201cdemoralized condition.\u201d\nTwo of the most famous leaders of the suffrage movement, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, published The Revolution, a women\u2019s rights newspaper. The newspaper frequently published editorials forcefully opposed to abortion. Anthony denounced abortion along with a list of other evils such as murder, infanticide, adultery and rape in her famous speech \u201cSocial Purity.\u201d\nStanton, a social activist, abolitionist and suffragist, believed that abortion was used to oppress women, not lift them up. She called it \u201ca crying evil\u201d and said that giving women the right to vote was one way of actually helping to end abortion. She and other suffragists reasoned that when women could vote, they could end unjust laws that allowed husbands the sole discretion of deciding when their wives would become pregnant. Ending \u201cforced maternity\u201d by domineering husbands would do much to end women seeking abortions.\nThese women and many other leaders of the suffrage movement recognized the value of every human life and that one group\u2019s rights could never be built by destroying another\u2019s.\nMany modern feminists claim that abortion is empowering for a woman, giving her the ability to decide when and if to have children. But early feminists would find it ludicrous to claim that becoming empowered meant taking another\u2019s life and denying something that makes her uniquely female\u2014her ability to be a mother.\nToday\u2019s pro-life women believe in the intrinsic value of every human life and the equal rights of every human being, whether born or unborn. As such, we continue the fight for human rights and social reform in the image of the original suffrage movement until all are recognized as equal. That means pro-life women have just as much\u2014if not more\u2013of a claim to that history as any other woman.\nIn the words of the original suffragists, we \u201cshall not be denied.\u201d\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Washington Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
