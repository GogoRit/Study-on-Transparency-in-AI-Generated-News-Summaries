The position, tasked with promoting \u201cthe rights and empowerment of women and girls through U.S. foreign policy,\u201d was vacant for three years until Kelley Currie began her tenure as the third U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\u2019s Issues in January of this year. If Currie\u2019s role is permanently established by Congress, it would guarantee the longevity of this critical U.S. foreign policy post\u2014one that has not only influenced U.S. policymaking but also inspired other governments around the world.More on:\n\nWomen and Women's Rights\n\n\nU.S. Congress\n\nPromoting gender equality has been shown to drive economic growth, improve health outcomes, bolster the chances of lasting peace, and strengthen democracy.

The role was established \u201cto raise the importance of women\u2019s perspectives and participation in all areas of our foreign policy engagement,\u201d Verveer told us. \u201cThe Administration noted that this was in the interests of U.S. national security and [...] that we can\u2019t possibly begin to solve our pressing foreign policy challenges\u2014from growing economies and advancing peace and security to addressing climate change and more\u2014without women\u2019s full participation and engagement.\u201d\nSince then, a growing number of nations have taken steps to institutionalize gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment as a policy priority in the areas of diplomacy, defense, aid, and trade. For a few\u2014namely Canada, France, Mexico, and Sweden\u2014this means an explicit feminist foreign policy that places equality at its center. For others, it takes the form of budget targets for foreign aid, ministry-wide strategic guidance, and personnel parity measures. And for some, it involves the appointment of high-level positions focused on women and girls.\nIn the past decade, ten more countries have followed the United States\u2019 lead, creating an ambassador or envoy post within their ministries of foreign affairs focused specifically on gender equality. In 2010, the Seychelles established an Ambassador for Women and Children\u2019s Affairs, currently held by Dr. Erna Athanasius. In 2011, Australia appointed its first Ambassador for Women and Girls, an office initially proposed by a coalition of civil society organizations. As in the United States, the post has lasted across administrations, and Julie-Ann Guivarra is the country\u2019s fourth ambassador. And soon after the Swedish government launched the world\u2019s first feminist foreign policy in 2014, it appointed Ann Bernes as Ambassador for Gender Equality and Coordinator of Feminist Foreign Policy.\nThe creation of similar roles is accelerating. Norway created a special envoy post for women, peace, and security, held by Marita S\u00f8rheim-Rensvik, and Finland appointed an ambassador for gender equality, a position currently held by Katri Viinikka. In 2017, the United Kingdom designated Joanna Roper to Special Envoy for Gender Equality, and in 2018, Iceland appointed a Special Envoy for Gender Equality, while Spain named an Ambassador in a Special Mission for Gender Equality. And just last year, the Netherlands expanded the mandate of its Ambassador for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights & HIV/AIDS to a broader ambassador post for women\u2019s rights and gender equality, while Canada appointed an Ambassador for Women, Peace, and Security.More on:\n\nWomen and Women's Rights\n\n\nU.S. Congress\n\nSetting the Agenda\nThe appointments of gender ambassadors and envoys have changed the way these countries do business, at home and abroad. While all are housed within their respective foreign ministries, their specific mandates vary: some are primarily focused externally, while others work to mainstream gender equality within their departments.\nFormer Australia Ambassador for Women and Girls, Natasha Stott Despoja, reports that she \u201cwas responsible for all the government\u2019s work internationally on gender equality,\u201d participating in bilateral visits and in regional and multilateral forums on behalf of the government. Much of the Australian ambassador\u2019s work focuses on neighboring countries in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, her counterpart in Canada, the newly appointed Ambassador for Women, Peace, and Security Jacqueline O\u2019Neill, covers both global and domestic work. Her position was established \u201cto accelerate the pace of change in implementing the WPS [Women, Peace, and Security] agenda in Canada and abroad\u201d by advising the government and serving as \u201ca boost of surge capacity.\u201d Ambassador O\u2019Neill\u2019s mandate spans eight Canadian departments, and one federal agency, to ensure they share lessons, ideas, and challenges with each other.\nIn the United Kingdom, Special Envoy for Gender Equality Joanna Roper, promotes gender mainstreaming throughout the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where she has worked to build internal capacity on gender equality \u201cthrough gender equality courses, induction talks to new members of staff, as well [as] briefing outgoing Ambassadors.\u201d\nIn Sweden, Ambassador for Gender Equality and Coordinator of Feminist Foreign Policy Ann Bernes\u00a0leads a coordination team that works on policy and skills development,\u00a0operational planning, communication, and representation. The team partners with the Division for Gender Equality at the Swedish Ministry of Employment to coordinate gender equality work across the government, and drafts the Swedish Foreign Service\u2019s annual action plan on feminist foreign policy.\nMaking Progress\nExperience from countries with ambassador and envoy positions for women and girls shows that these offices make a difference. Appointing a gender equality ambassador or envoy carries symbolic power, and indicates a state\u2019s recognition of gender equality as a foreign policy priority. \u201cWhen an issue is not a strategic priority, it often doesn\u2019t receive the resources needed,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. She explains that her \u201crole is at the level of ambassador to send a signal of Canada\u2019s commitment. It enables unique access and helps confer importance\u2014both at home and abroad.\u201d\nThe role can also push the adoption of gender equality mandates across the foreign ministry. \u201cThere is no doubt that this role in Australia helped influence political and policy understanding of issues affecting women,\u201d says Stott-Despoja. \u201cThere was a demonstrable change in the way diplomats and other personnel within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade focused their energies and programs on ensuring that gender equality was a key part of their work.\u201d\nGender ambassador appointments can help change minds and organizational culture internally. In the United Kingdom, the \u201ccreation of the [Special Envoy] position recognized the need for gender equality to be taken seriously,\u201d according to Roper, and in the United States, the ambassador post helped overcome skepticism within the American foreign policy community. \u201cIt made a difference that this was an ambassadorial level position and that was purposeful. An ambassador was given greater recognition by most foreign governments and often within our own government,\u201d according to Verveer. \u201cMoreover, the position directly reported to the Secretary of State and that sent a signal throughout the Department that this was important.\u201d\nThe Way Forward\nThe creation of an ambassador or envoy post for women and girls is a small\u2014but smart\u2014investment that more governments around the world should undertake, not least during a time of tightening budgets and growing global concerns over the economic fallout of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To enable these offices to accelerate the adoption of gender mainstreaming internally, and the promotion of gender equality abroad, they must be fully-resourced and installed at the highest level. Reporting directly to the foreign minister or prime minister improves accountability and ensures that their mandates are seen as a priority across the government. And on the home front, it is time for the United States to lead the way again as it did a decade ago, by institutionalizing the State Department\u2019s Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues and its Ambassador-at-Large position. These steps will not just reinforce the United States\u2019 long-standing commitment to gender equality in foreign policy, but also bolster American economic and security interests abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Commons\n\n\n\n\n      Creative Commons: Some rights reserved.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\nView License Detail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Double Pandemic: Domestic Violence in the Age of COVID-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cViral Convergence\u201d: Interconnected Pandemics as Portal to Racial Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion Law: Global Comparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nMember Programs\n\n\nContact\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nFor Media\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nMembership\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92024 Council on Foreign Relations.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nPrivacy Policy and\r\n      Terms of Use.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
