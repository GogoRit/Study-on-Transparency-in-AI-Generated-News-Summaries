It simply keeps abortion policy in the hands of our legislators rather than state judges,\u201d Jackson wrote in an op-ed in The Advocate last month.\n\u201cOur body of pro-life laws ensure that women are empowered with the truth about their pregnancy prior to an abortion, that minors seeking an abortion have parental consent, and that babies born alive following a botched abortion receive immediate medical care. Our law also makes sure that not a dollar of your state tax dollars fund abortion. Yet these laws and others are at risk unless we pass Amendment 1,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana already has a \u201ctrigger law\u201d that would ban abortion in the state \u2014 with some exceptions to save the life of the mother \u2014 should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.\nJackson had also authored a bipartisan Louisiana law requiring that abortion clinics be held to the same standards as surgical centers, which the Supreme Court threw out in June.\nFour justices ruled in June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo that Louisiana\u2019s requirement that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at a local hospital would have made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for abortion clinics to comply, without offering a significant health benefit for women. Justice Stephen Breyer authored the opinion, and Chief Justice John Roberts concurred to tip the court\u2019s balance 5-4 against Louisiana\u2019s law.\nThe Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, as that law was known, received widespread support from both parties in the state legislature and was signed into law by then-governor Bobby Jindal, R, in 2014.\n\n\nKeywords: \nlouisiana\nabortion\nstate
