Wade being overturned.\nIn the case of the former, that would mean the end of protections for people with preexisting conditions, and the ban on lifetime caps, as well as the end of a provision that allows young people to stay on their parents\u2019 plans up to age 26 \u2014 moves that would all disproportionately impact women.\nIn the case of the latter, the regulation of abortion would be returned to states, where it\u2019s likely that between 18 and 24 states would ban or severely restrict abortion services entirely, she said, adding that access to other important reproductive health services, such as contraception, also would be impacted.\n\u201cAll the rights we hold dear \u2026 are in jeopardy,\u201d Kolbert said during a joint news conference in suburban Philadelphia, where she, Gov. Tom Wolf, and two Democratic state lawmakers called on the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate to put the brakes on confirming President Donald Trump\u2019s high court pick, federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett, until after the election.\n\u201cThe ascension of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court is extremely dangerous,\u201d Kolbert said, noting that if Barrett is confirmed, which now seems locked in, the high court \u201cwill have a 6-3 vote margin, all conservative, many of whom will alter our understanding of constitutional law.\u201d\nThat puts rights ranging from abortion access and marriage equality to voters rights and workplace discrimination protections on the chopping block.\nKolbert\u2019s musings are hardly idle.\nIn 1992, she was the lead attorney in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that effectively guaranteed the right to abortion, though it did give states the right to regulate the procedure after a fetus was considered \u201cviable,\u201d or able to survive on its own outside the womb.\nCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has called Kolbert\u2019s defense of the right to abortion \u201cone of the most audacious litigation strategies in Supreme Court history.\u201d Between 1985 and 1998, the Philadelphian was involved in every reproductive rights case to be argued before the Supreme Court, according to an official biography.\nPennsylvania\u2019s senior senator, Democrat Bob Casey, of Scranton, has already said he has no plans to meet with Barrett, who was unveiled as the White House\u2019s high court pick just days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an icon to progressives, and stalwart defender of women\u2019s rights.\nThat leaves Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who\u2019s publicly reversed himself on the position he took on President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick, federal Judge Merrick Garland. Back then, with 11 months to go before the election, Toomey joined fellow Republicans to say the Senate needed to put off naming a replacement until after the election.\nThis year, Toomey says moving ahead with Barrett\u2019s nomination is fair game because, unlike 2016, the White House and Senate are both controlled by Republicans, and that Trump should get his pick. It\u2019s a bit of rhetorical sound and fury signifying some epic hypocrisy.\u00a0\nIf Republicans manage to ram through Barrett\u2019s nomination before Election Day \u2014 or worse, during a lame-duck session in which potentially defeated senators would not have to face the voters \u2014 the Indiana jurist could be on the bench in time to rule on the Republican spearheaded challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\nIt\u2019s a tight timeline: The court is scheduled to hold oral arguments on Nov. 10, Simon Haeder, a Penn State University public policy professor, wrote in a recent Capital-Star op-Ed.\nBut it could still happen, Duquesne University Law School professor Bruce Ledewitz, an expert in constitutional law and Capital-Star opinion contributor, said Thursday.\nBarrett already has said she opposes the law, and once wrote that she believes that U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts, who had previously voted to save the statute, \u201cpushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning,\u201d when he did so, according to the Washington Post.\n\u201cIt seems to me that women suffer the most if Affordable Care Act goes down,\u201d Kolbert said, adding that. \u201cmany of us forget what insurance was like before Affordable Care Act,\u201d as she noted that women will \u201cbe forced to pay more mammograms,\u201d as well as pregnancy care and well-women services.\nTrump, who faces former Vice President Joe Biden in November, has argued that the entire law \u201cmust fall,\u201d though, to date, he has not offered a formal plan to replacement beyond a vaguely worded executive order that tells the government, without any administration guidance, to come up with something, an expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute told Kaiser Health News.\nFor Kolbert, the attack on the Affordable Care Act, is \u201cjust really mean-spirited \u2026 in the days of the pandemic.\u201d\nIn an age of weaponized hyperbole, Kolbert\u2019s soberly offered assessment feels like an epic understatement.\nWhich is precisely why it\u2019s so unnerving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\u2018All the rights we hold dear are in jeopardy,\u2019 famed lawyer Kathryn Kolbert warns of conservative Supreme Court | John L.
