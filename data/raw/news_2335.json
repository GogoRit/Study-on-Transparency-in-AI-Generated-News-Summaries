Kay Granger for re-election.\nNational Right to Life praised the Fort Worth Republican for her work on important pro-life legislation and her 100% voting record in the 116th Congress.\n\"Nothing is more sacred than life, and that's why I'm proud to be endorsed by National Right to Life and other pro-life leaders and organizations,\" said Granger. \"In Congress, I'll continue to defend the unborn against those who do not value life or the values we hold dear in the 12th district.\"\nGranger co-sponsored and voted for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require that a baby born alive during an abortion must be afforded the same degree of care that would apply to any other child at the same gestational age. She also voted for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, legislation to protect unborn children at 20 weeks. Granger also opposes using tax dollars to pay for abortion and taxpayer funding of abortion providers.\nIn December, President Donald Trump also endorsed Rep. Granger for reelection.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n City of Fort Worth hosting PPE giveaway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Presidents of North Texas realtors groups say settlement proposal likely not a bridge to cheaper homes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How unlicensed group care homes operate with little oversight: \"I think the system failed my brother\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Millions of Spring Break travelers head back to North Texas amid gloomy weather\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man in critical condition after West 7th shooting\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Roe v.
