(ACASAC) write about how women\u2019s movements and organized civil society in Mexico have advanced a policy agenda for the health sector. \n\n\u00a0\nLeer en espa\u00f1ol \u203a\nSince the 1990s, women\u2019s health and rights movements and organized civil society in Mexico have created, implemented, and promoted a clear policy and political action agenda for the health sector.\nOur demands have centered around quality health services for abortions, greater access to sexuality education and contraceptives for women, improving the quality of care to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, and the legalization of abortion. This important work could not be carried out without the participation and leadership of women.\u00a0\nThe United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, which centered on human and women\u2019s rights, made clear the consensus between governments to prioritize maternal healthcare. The Summit suggested that maternal healthcare is a human right. The challenge has been putting this into practice. While human rights provide us with a powerful focus for action, without the ability to institutionalize those rights, the status quo does not change.\nIt has been difficult to make maternal healthcare a right because for decades there were no existing mechanisms for implementation, such as institutions, practices, trained personnel, accountability measures, or the political will of the Mexican government. We had the focus, the international treaties, and the legal frameworks, but there were no mechanisms that allowed citizens to access the rights granted to them in Mexico\u2019s national and state-level constitutions and international agreements.\nBeginning in the twenty-first century, we saw success in the work toward institutional accountability. In 2010, we inaugurated the Maternal Mortality Observatory in Mexico, which monitors implementation of public policies and statistics. It allows us to see advances in maternal health.\nThe Maternal Mortality Observatory in Mexico has also carried out audits to identify concrete areas for improvement, from healthcare workers\u2019 knowledge to indispensable supplies and medicines to proposing simple and replicable methodologies. It has produced results in Mexico such as: the paradigm shift from a focus on risk management in maternal care to obstetric emergency care, providing free obstetric care, and publishing maternal mortality statistics that allow us to monitor state- and national-level trends.\nToday we find ourselves facing an uncertain horizon due to the restructuring of Mexico\u2019s public institutions. Some of the autonomous bodies that have created accountability and transparency are now at risk, including attempts to dissolve the National Access to Information Institute. Victims, collectives, and civil society organizations occupied the offices of the National Human Rights Commission in a desperate act to combat the weakening of state institutions.\nWe are at a decisive moment where we must build the movement\u2019s strength and work more collaboratively than ever before in order to fight setbacks and accelerate progress towards maternal health as a human right and a chosen, safe, and joyful motherhood.\n \n\n\n    Latest News & Related Content   Filter By:  All Related                      News                                               Stories                                  In the Media     Perspectives     Evaluations                              Grantee Research                            Press Releases               View All Related                       \n\nRelated Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Rights\nGrantmaking supported strengthening human rights protections, advancing government accountability, and improving the reach and quality of justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Rights\nGrantmaking supported strengthening human rights protections, advancing government accountability, and improving the reach and quality of justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Work in Mexico\nFor more than three decades, grantmaking in Mexico supported civil society organizations focused on human rights, reproductive healthcare, and migration issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover\n\nAbout\nWhat's New\nPrograms\nGrants\nLearnings\n\n\n\nConnect\n\nOur Offices\nPress & Media\n     \n\n\n\nStay Informed\nSign up for periodic news updates and event invitations. \n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \u00a9 2024 John D. and Catherine T.
