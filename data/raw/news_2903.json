That's one reason why the \"perinatal death\" issue is a legitimate concern.\nFormer nurse Jill Stanek even testified to the U.S. Congress that it's not some made-up scare tactic. She reported her first-hand experience where hospital abortion workers were taking babies from botched abortions off to die.\n\"One night a nursing co-worker was taking a little abortion survivor to the soiled utility room,\" she recalled. \"And when she told me what she was doing, I couldn't bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone. So I cradled and rocked him for the 45 minutes that he lived.\"\nStanek said that heartbreaking experience \"transformed me\" into \"a pro-life activist for sure.\"\nPro-Abortion Groups Champion AB 2223\nCalifornia's AB 2223 is promoted by the state's \"Future of Abortion Council,\" a coalition of 40 pro-abortion groups whose goal is \"to Protect, Strengthen, and Expand Abortion Services in California.\" The abortion council is currently advocating for nine different abortion expansion bills.\nAB 2223, authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) and co-authored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore Kevin Mullin (D-South San Francisco), additionally protects anyone who \"aids or assists a pregnant person in exercising\" these rights. It also allows a woman to sue any police department or legal authority which arrests or charges her for hurting or killing her child under provisions of the bill.\nCBN News has reached out to Assemblymember Wicks' office for comment. \u00a0We'll post a response here if we receive one.\u00a0\n'It Legalizes Infanticide, Plain and Simple'\nCalifornia Family Council President Jonathan Keller said if this bill passes the state legislature, it will be \"open season on unwanted newborns\" in the state.\u00a0\n\"For years, pro-life advocates have argued there is no moral difference between ending a child's life days before birth or days after birth. California's pro-abortion legislators now seemingly agree,\" Keller noted. \"A political culture that justifies killing millions of children in the womb is now declaring open season on unwanted newborns. Every Californian must oppose this heinous bill.\"\nOther legal experts who also live in California also say that AB 2223 would essentially legalize infanticide in the state. \u00a0\n\"Under the guise of \"reproductive health,\" this bill seeks to decriminalize killing babies not only in the womb but also even after the baby is born,\" Attorney Nada Higuera with Tyler & Bursch, LLP explained. \"This is the most extreme, anti-life bill in California's history. It legalizes infanticide, plain and simple.\"\nNational Center for Law and Policy President Dean Broyles warns the bill could possibly legalize the infanticide of children several weeks and even up to one year after birth since the term \"perinatal\" is somewhat open-ended.\u00a0\n\"AB 2223 seeks to legalize the killing of babies in California after birth. Depending on how the term 'perinatal' is interpreted by the courts, this bill legalizes the infanticide of children several weeks after their birth and possibly as late as their first birthday,\" Broyles argued. \"If this barbaric bill is enacted, there will be no criminal or civil liability for the mother or those who assist her with killing her baby post-birth.\"\nAnd Attorney Susan Arnall, Esq., Director of Outreach for the Right to Life League, also pointed to the absurdity of giving the ability to someone who helped a mother kill her baby after birth to sue law enforcement officials.\u00a0\n\"In California under AB 2223, former Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, who murdered three infants born alive after botched abortions, could not be prosecuted,\" Arnall explained. \"And incredibly, someone like Gosnell who helped a California mother kill her newborn after birth will actually have a cause of action to sue police for investigating the matter if AB 2223 becomes law.\"\n\n\n\n\nShare This article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink was copied!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      About The Author\n  \n\n\n\nSteve Warren and Benjamin Gill\nSteve Warren and Benjamin Gill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock the best from CBN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are signing up to receive general newsletters from CBN.
