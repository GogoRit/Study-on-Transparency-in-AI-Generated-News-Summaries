Lynn Winmill granted a pause Wednesday on the Idaho law banning nearly all abortions as it applies to emergency care at hospitals, following a challenge by the U.S. Department of Justice. The department argued the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. (Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Judge B. Lynn Winmill granted a pause Wednesday on the Idaho law banning nearly all abortions as it applies to emergency care at hospitals, following a challenge by the U.S. Department of Justice. The department argued the law violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.\nThe abortion ban becomes effective Thursday, but doctors facing emergency medical decisions are protected from penalties under the abortion ban for now with Winmill\u2019s ruling.\u00a0\n\u201cSpecifically, the state of Idaho, including all of its officers, employees, and agents, are prohibited from initiating any criminal prosecution against, attempting to suspend or revoke the professional license of, or seeking to impose any other form of liability on, any medical provider or hospital,\u201d the ruling states, if an abortion is necessary to avoid placing the health of a pregnant patient \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d or risking serious impairment to bodily functions or organs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion group says lawsuit is frivolous\nBlaine Conzatti, who is president of the Idaho Family Policy Center and a key proponent of Idaho\u2019s abortion laws, issued a statement Wednesday evening celebrating the fact that the trigger law will still be effective as of Thursday.\n\u201cThis frivolous lawsuit will ultimately be exposed as a last-ditch attempt on the part of a pro-abortion presidential administration to keep abortion legal and easily accessible in Idaho,\u201d Conzatti said. \u201cThe trigger law is a great next step toward ensuring the legal protection of all preborn babies, but it\u2019s not our final goal. We\u2019re going to keep pushing until every preborn child, regardless of the circumstances of their conception, receives equal protection in every area of state law.\u201d\n\n Idaho Democratic legislators say law should never have been passed\n\n\nIn a statement, Democratic legislators said they were relieved to hear about the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis law should never have been passed in the first place,\u201d House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said in the statement. \u201cIt is an outrage that GOP legislators voted to deny a woman an abortion even where continuing the pregnancy will cause her paralysis, serious organ damage, lifelong infertility or amputation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe injunction will be in effect until a final judgment is reached in the case at a later date, according to the order.\n\u201cAllowing the criminal abortion ban to take effect, without a cutout for EMTALA-required care, would inject tremendous uncertainty into precisely what care is required (and permitted) for pregnant patients who present in Medicare-funded emergency rooms with emergency medical conditions,\u201d Winmill wrote.\nThe Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office declined to comment on the ruling, saying the case is still ongoing.\nWinmill issued the written decision two days after a hearing in Boise between the Department of Justice and attorneys for the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office and the Idaho Legislature. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit at the beginning of August against the state of Idaho on the grounds that the abortion ban violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). That law requires hospitals that receive payments for the federal Medicare program to provide medical care to stabilize all patients who come to the hospital with a medical emergency. Violating the federal EMTALA law can result in a hospital losing its ability to receive Medicare payments, which is one of the main sources of revenue for hospitals.\nIdaho\u2019s trigger law prohibits abortion in Idaho in nearly all cases, with potential defenses for rape, incest or to save a patient\u2019s life. If a medical provider violates the statute, they can be convicted of a felony with a sentence of two to five years in prison. Anyone who performs or assists in abortion can also have their license suspended for a minimum of six months or permanently.\u00a0\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s complaint said Idaho\u2019s trigger law puts health care providers in an untenable position of risking either criminal prosecution under the state law or\u00a0 enforcement actions under the federal EMTALA law.\n\u201cThe clear and intended effect of Idaho\u2019s criminal abortion law is to curb abortion as a form of medical care. This extends to emergency situations, obstructing EMTALA\u2019s purpose,\u201d Winmill wrote. \u201cIdaho\u2019s choice to impose severe and sweeping sanctions that decrease the overall availability of emergency abortion care flies in the face of Congress\u2019s deliberate decision to do the opposite.\u201d\nFederal judge sides with Texas, blocks HHS guidance on emergency abortions\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s hearing, Winmill indicated he was inclined to grant the Department of Justice\u2019s request to halt implementation of the law, saying he had several concerns about situations highlighted by physicians and he thought the federal law and Idaho\u2019s law seemed to be in \u201cabsolute conflict\u201d with each other.\nThe decision is contrary to a ruling that came Tuesday night from a federal judge in Texas, who said guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services about the law \u201cgoes well beyond\u201d the text of the federal law, which he wrote \u201cprotects both mothers and unborn children, is silent as to abortion, and preempts state law only when the two directly conflict,\u201d according to reporting from States Newsroom. That decision applies to the state of Texas, members of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations.\u00a0\ngov.uscourts.idd.50547.95.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIdaho federal judge partially blocks abortion trigger ban\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun August 24, 2022\nIdaho federal judge partially blocks abortion trigger ban\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun August 24, 2022\n District Judge B.
