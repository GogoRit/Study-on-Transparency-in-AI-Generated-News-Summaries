Wade. It follows an earlier legal challenge to a Utah law banning most non-emergency abortions. That law remains unimplemented, tied up in court.\nUtah\u2019s abortion clinic ban seeks to stop new facilities from getting licenses and was set to take effect on Wednesday. It would also faze out existing licenses by next year. Stone\u2019s decision prevents Utah from joining states such as West Virginia, North Dakota and Mississippi, all of which have pushed out abortion clinics.\nPlanned Parenthood argued that the Utah law effectively banned abortion because 95 percent of the procedures are provided in clinics and hospitals aren\u2019t as well-equipped to offer low-cost outpatient care, including the abortion pill. Planned Parenthood said state lawmakers\u00a0and\u00a0Gov. Spencer Cox\u00a0enacted the law to bypass the court system while it weighs challenges to other abortion restrictions.\nREAD MORE: Utah bans abortion clinics in new wave of restrictions\nSarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood\u2019s Utah affiliate, said the ruling \u201cmeans that clinics can continue providing essential health care to our patients, who for months have lived in a state of chaos and confusion over the impact of this law on their lives.\u201d\nWhile welcoming Tuesday\u2019s ruling, Stoesz said the threat to Utah residents\u2019 health and personal freedom \u201cremains dire as politicians continue to undermine our judicial process.\u201d\nIn his ruling, Stone agreed to delay implementing the law because Planned Parenthood had presented enough preliminary evidence to suggest it \u201csingles out\u201d abortion clinics without reason. The challenge will now advance through the court system while the law remains on hold.\n\u201cThere is nothing before the Court to indicate that an injunction would be adverse to the public interest,\u201d Stone said in his ruling.\nThe office of Utah\u2019s Attorney General declined to comment on pending litigation. Republican lawmakers have previously said the law was designed to provide clarity to hospitals and clarify parts of the legal code that would no longer be relevant once the state\u2019s abortion restrictions are fully implemented. They also have noted that clinics could apply for expanded licenses as hospitals under the new framework.\nUtah is one of 19 states to have tightened abortion restrictions since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade, with many relying on \u201ctrigger laws\u201d passed in the years leading up to the decision. Such laws laid out restrictions that would be triggered by any Supreme Court ruling that reversed Roe.\nIn Utah, overturning Roe triggered two pieces of legislation: an 18-week ban passed in 2019 and a 2020 ban on abortions regardless of trimester, with several exceptions to protect maternal health or in cases of rape or incest reported to the police.\nPlanned Parenthood sued over the 2020 ban, and last July, Stone\u00a0delayed implementing\u00a0it until legal challenges could be resolved.\nAbortion remains legal up to 18 weeks in the state as the court weighs that challenge.\nWhen Utah passed its clinic ban in March, it became the first state to adopt such a law in the post-Roe era.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Debbie Jeffreys of Metairie, Louisiana, holds a sign during nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision, at Duncan Plaza in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., May 14, 2022.
