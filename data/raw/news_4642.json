While not conclusive, the leaked U.S. Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade portends the sobering reality that reproductive rights are under serious attack across the country. Virginia faces two conflicting realities when it comes to abortion in the Commonwealth. First, the good news: if Roe v Wade is overturned, abortion will still be legal in Virginia, absent a change in the law.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nBut equally true is the fact that abortion rights are in deep peril here. Virginia is literally just one vote away from banning abortion. During the 2022 General Assembly, seven anti-abortion bills were introduced. Efforts to reinstate onerous, medically unnecessary barriers to abortion like a twenty-week abortion ban, written informed consent, and biased counseling were thwarted, but similar and even more restrictive bills could be re-introduced by legislators in future sessions. And while these barriers and abortion bans would affect all people, they would create the most significant barriers for Black and Brown communities, people with disabilities, people in the LGBTQ+ community, people who are poor, people who are young, and people who live in rural areas.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nNearly one in four women who can become pregnant in America will have an abortion in their lifetime. And that means that, almost\u00a0certainly, someone you know and love has made the decision to end a pregnancy.\u202fPeople end pregnancies for a myriad of reasons \u2013 they aren\u2019t ready to be a parent; they have survived abuse, rape, or incest; they cannot afford another child; they are at risk for complications that can put their lives in danger.\u00a0 These decisions are deeply personal, and they are best made by people who know what is best for themselves. Abortion is a low-risk, incredibly safe medical procedure. In short, it is healthcare. Where abortion is illegal, pregnant people\u2019s health suffers, and sometimes, they die. History has proven that making abortion illegal doesn't stop people from seeking the care they need; it only makes it less safe. The decision to have an abortion is a healthcare issue that should be left up to an individual and their doctor; it should not be made by politicians and judges.\u00a0\nSo now more than ever, it\u2019s important that people act. Join the ACLU of Virginia and coalition partners* across the Commonwealth, to urge all that believe in reproductive freedom to:\u00a0\nTake the time to hear the stories of people who\u2019ve had an abortion, or if you\u2019ve had an abortion,\u00a0share your story.\nSupport abortion funds, abortion providers and organizations advocating for abortion access.
