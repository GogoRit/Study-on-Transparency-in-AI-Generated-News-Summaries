    "description": "The theme of International Youth Day 2020\u00a0is \"Youth Engagement for Global Action\". It is intended to highlight the ways in which the engagement of young people at local, national and global levels is enriching national and multilateral institutions and processes, as well as draw lessons on how their representation and engagement in formal institutional politics can be significantly enhanced.\u00a0The theme of the day prompts three questions:\u00a0What is meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0What is the\u00a0status of meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0How does the WHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and the Human Reproduction Programme strive to practice meaningful youth engagement in its work?\u00a0\u00a0What is meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0Meaningful youth engagement, as defined by the\u00a02018 Global Consensus Statement,\u00a0is an inclusive, intentional, mutually-respectful partnership between young people and adults whereby power is shared, respective contributions are valued, and young people\u2019s ideas, perspectives, skills, and strengths are integrated into the design and delivery of programs, strategies, policies, funding mechanisms, and organizations that affect their lives and their communities, countries, and world.\u00a0\u00a0It is framed by five principles:\u00a0that it should be\u00a0rights-based; transparent and informative; voluntary and free from coercion; respectful of young people\u2019s views, backgrounds, and identities; and safe.\u00a0What is the\u00a0status of meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0Though global rhetoric increasingly acknowledges the value of meaningful youth engagement,\u00a0the reality is that\u00a0intentional\u00a0and institutionalized\u00a0efforts to include young people in political and programmatic processes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and\u00a0to ensure they have the real power to hold decision-makers accountable\u00a0\u2013\u00a0remain\u00a0limited. When young people are given opportunities to contribute, it is most often older, urban, educated, and well-connected young people that are selected, and their engagement remains largely tokenistic and their responsibilities menial\u00a0(e.g.,\u00a0leading energizer activities at\u00a0conferences, taking notes during\u00a0meetings, or formatting references in reports). When they are in a position to make substantive contributions, these are rarely measured effectively to demonstrate their value. Further, young contributors are often not appropriately acknowledged\u00a0(e.g., with authorship)\u00a0nor compensated\u00a0(e.g., with formal contracts and payment)\u00a0for their work.\u00a0\u00a0How does the WHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and the Human Reproduction Programme strive to practice meaningful youth engagement in its work?\u00a0The WHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and the Human Reproduction Programme strives\u00a0to\u00a0apply the principles\u00a0of meaningful youth engagement\u00a0in practice\u00a0in a number of ways, particularly in its work on adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights\u00a0(ASRHR).\u00a0One example of this is\u00a0the WHO and UNFPA-led\u00a0supplement\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Journal of Adolescent Health\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0stock of progress made in ASRHR in the 25 years since the International Conference on Population and Development and set out priorities for the future.\u00a0\u00a0First,\u00a0seven young people\u00a0from Botswana, Fiji, India, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey\u00a0were identified using a\u00a0structured selection process, in collaboration with the Partnership for Maternal,\u00a0Newborn, and Child Health.\u00a0Their selection was based on profiles with specific criteria, just as was done for representatives from international organizations, governments, academia, civil society, and funding agencies.\u00a0Second, the young people were issued formal contracts, guaranteeing their acknowledgement as co-authors and compensation for their time and effort. These contracts spelled out clear\u00a0expectations regarding their\u00a0roles and responsibilities, as well as focal persons they could turn to for support.\u00a0\u00a0Third, the young people engaged actively and as equal partners with the other contributors\u00a0throughout the process. They started out by sharing their individual ideas and perspectives, and then worked collaboratively with each other and with the broader group of co-authors to pull together key themes and messages and develop the papers.\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the\u00a0young people\u00a0worked with an artist to develop an illustrated video to bring the supplement to life, highlighting what they felt to be the most important messages of the supplement.\u00a0\u00a0Fifth, two of the organizations represented by the young people (IFMSA and IYAFP) are contributing to regional webinars to disseminate the supplement and draw out\u00a0its\u00a0particular relevance for each WHO region.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

engagement to improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights\u00a0\u00a0Every day, young people\u00a0are\u00a0enriching institutions and processes\u00a0at the local,\u00a0national,\u00a0and\u00a0global levels.\u00a0\u00a0This year, the\u00a0theme of International Youth Day is \"Youth Engagement for Global Action.\"\u00a0It\nhighlights the importance and value of young people\u2019s contributions\u00a0and\u00a0draws\u00a0lessons on how their representation and engagement in formal institutional politics can be significantly enhanced.\u00a0\u00a0The theme of the day\u00a0raises\u00a0three questions:\u00a0What is meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0What are the benefits and challenges of meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0How does\u00a0WHO strive to\u00a0practice meaningful youth engagement in its work?\u00a0What is meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0Meaningful youth engagement, as defined by the\u00a02018 Global Consensus Statement, is an inclusive,\nintentional, mutually-respectful partnership between young people and adults.\u00a0\u00a0Power is shared\u00a0and\u00a0respective contributions are valued.\u00a0Young people\u2019s ideas, perspectives, skills, and strengths are integrated into the design and delivery of programs, strategies, policies, funding mechanisms\u00a0-\u00a0and organizations that affect their lives and their communities, countries, and\nworld.\u00a0\nWhat are the benefits and challenges of meaningful youth engagement?\u00a0Meaningful youth engagement ensures that young people are equal and valuable partners \u2013 not only beneficiaries \u2013 in efforts to improve their health and wellbeing. It increases the likelihood that policies and\u00a0programmes\u00a0will be acceptable,\nappropriate, and responsive to their needs and preferences.\u00a0\u00a0Although global rhetoric increasingly acknowledges the value of meaningful youth engagement, it often remains\u00a0more of an aspiration than a reality. There is still considerable resistance to giving young people a place at the table.\u00a0When young people are given opportunities to contribute, it is most often older, urban, educated, and well-connected young people that are selected.\u00a0Their engagement is often tokenistic and their responsibilities small,\u00a0for instance\u00a0leading\nenergizer activities at conferences, taking notes during meetings, or formatting references in reports. Additionally, young people\u2019s contributions are rarely measured effectively to demonstrate their value,\u00a0and\u00a0their\u00a0contributions\u00a0are\noften not appropriately acknowledged, either with authorship or compensation.\u00a0\u00a0This must not be the case. Meaningful youth engagement\u00a0is central to the success of policies and\u00a0programmes\u00a0aimed at improving young people\u2019s health and\u00a0wellbeing, and\u00a0can\u00a0provide\u00a0young people\u00a0with opportunities\nto develop skillsets\u00a0they will need as\u00a0the next generation of leaders.\u00a0\u00a0How does the WHO strive to practice meaningful youth engagement in its work?\u00a0The WHO Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and the Human Reproduction\u00a0Programme\u00a0(HRP)\u00a0strive to apply the principles of meaningful youth engagement,\u00a0as defined in the Global Consensus Statement,\u00a0particularly\u00a0with\u00a0work\non adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights (ASRHR).\u00a0\u00a0For example, it put meaningful youth engagement into practice with the WHO and UNFPA-led\u00a0supplement of the\u00a0Journal of Adolescent Health. This supplement\u00a0takes\u00a0stock of progress made in ASRHR in the\n25 years since the International Conference on Population and Development\u00a0and sets\u00a0out priorities for the future.\u00a0\u00a0The process of developing the supplement was:\u00a0Transparent and informative.\u00a0Seven young people from Botswana, Fiji, India, Lithuania, Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey were identified using a structured selection process, in collaboration with the\u00a0Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child\u00a0(PMNCH). Their selection was based on profiles with specific criteria,\u00a0the same\u00a0as for representatives from international organizations, governments,\nacademia, civil society, and funding agencies.\u00a0Rights-based.\u00a0The young people engaged actively and as equal partners with the other contributors throughout the process.\u00a0They played a key role in ensuring that young people\u2019s rights were front and center in the content\nof the supplement.\u00a0\u00a0Voluntary and free from coercion.\u00a0The young people were issued formal contracts,\u00a0assuring co-authorship\u00a0and\u00a0compensation\u00a0for their time and effort. These contracts were developed with and approved by the young\npeople, themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Safe.\u00a0The contracts spelled out clear expectations regarding their roles and responsibilities, which were fully in line with their abilities. Additionally, throughout the process, they had a focal person they could turn to for support.\u00a0\u00a0\nRespectful of young people\u2019s views, backgrounds, and identities.\u00a0The young people began by sharing their individual ideas and perspectives, and then worked collaboratively with each other\u00a0and with the broader group of\nco-authors to pull together key themes and messages and develop the papers. Next, they\u00a0worked with an artist to develop an illustrated video to bring the supplement to life, highlighting what they felt to be the most important messages of the\nsupplement.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA)\u00a0and the\u00a0International Youth Alliance for Family Planning\u00a0(IYAFP), two of the organizations represented by the young people,\u00a0are contributing to\u00a0upcoming\u00a0regional\nwebinars to disseminate the supplement and draw out its\u00a0particular relevance\u00a0for each WHO region.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changing world of adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights\n3 February 2020\n\n\n\n\nFact sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent pregnancy\n2 June 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent and young adult health\n28 April 2023\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Youth Day\n\n\n12 August 2020 12:30 \u2013 14:00 CET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\nEastern Mediterranean\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\nWestern Pacific\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\nCyber security\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nPermissions and licensing\n\n\nPreventing sexual exploitation\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nReport misconduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\nPrivacy policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\u00a9\n\n2024\n\nWHO\n\n                       \n"
