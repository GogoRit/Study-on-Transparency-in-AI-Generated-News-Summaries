Ron DeSantis tweeted about the bill he signed into law on April 14. (photo: Screenshot from @GovRonDeSantis Twitter account; last visisted 4/15/22)\n\n\nKatie Yoder/CNA\nNation\nApril 14, 2022\n\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill protecting the unborn from abortion after 15-weeks gestation on Thursday. During his remarks, he referred to the aborted babies recently found in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing today is saying that we will not let that happen in the state of Florida,\u201d the Republican politician said.\u00a0\nAnti-abortion activists Lauren Handy and Terrisa Bukovinac of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising (PAAU) first told reporters on April 5 that they obtained 115 aborted babies from a driver for a medical-waste company outside a D.C. abortion facility, Washington Surgi-Clinic, with the intention of giving the unborn children a dignified funeral and burial.\u00a0\nFive of the babies, who appear to be of late-term gestation, were located by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) on March 30. PAAU says it arranged for the D.C. police to collect and examine the babies, fearing that the babies\u2019 injuries could be evidence of illegal abortions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, lawmakers have sent multiple letters calling for a full investigation and autopsies of the babies\u2019 bodies. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has given no indication that the city intends to autopsy the remains.\nDeSantis addressed what he called a \u201cterrible scandal.\u201d\n\u201cThey found all these remains of babies, and they found five who were basically infants \u2014 premature, they would have been, but they would have been able to survive outside the womb,\u201d he said. \u201cYet Washington, D.C., is treating that just like we would treat the trash from our lunch or something like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really horrifying to see that that could go on in our country, but particularly in our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d he concluded, and he thanked the Daily Wire\u2019s Mary Margaret Olohan for her coverage of the story.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeSantis signed into law House Bill 5 in Kissimmee, Florida. The legislation bans abortions in that state after an unborn baby reaches 15-weeks gestation, except to save the life or physical health of the mother and in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today to defend those who can\u2019t defend themselves,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThis will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation.\u201d\nIn addition to providing protections for the unborn, DeSantis highlighted that the legislation expands efforts to reduce fetal-infant mortality cases and works to improve hospitals\u2019 prenatal care.\u00a0\nPreviously, Florida law barred abortion after 24 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life leaders such as Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser praised DeSantis and Florida legislators for the new law.\n\u201cGov. DeSantis and the Florida Legislature have delivered a milestone victory for women and children,\u201d she said in a press release on Thursday. \u201cThe legislation enacted today may save more than 3,300 lives a year by protecting unborn children, as well as their mothers, from cruel and dangerous late abortions.\u201d\nShe concluded, \u201cAs we await a decision in the Dobbs case, momentum is growing across America to modernize our extreme abortion laws.\u201d\nThe new Florida law comes as the Supreme Court prepares to decide a highly anticipated case, Dobbs v. Jackson, which involves a 2018 Mississippi law restricting most abortions after 15 weeks. The case could potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, and leave abortion up to each individual state.\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \naborted babies\n15-week abortion ban\nflorida\nron desantis\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLauren Handy, Aborted Babies and the Ethics of Pro-Life Activism\n\nROUNDTABLE: What does ethical pro-life action look like?
