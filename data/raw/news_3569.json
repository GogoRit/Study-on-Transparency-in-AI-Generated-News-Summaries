month\n\t\t\t\n\nCredit: Alastair Grant/AP\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is 8.30 on an autumnal Wednesday morning, and a group of people are standing on a grass verge outside Bournemouth\u2019s abortion clinic. One middle-aged man holds up rosary beads. A silver-haired woman is carrying a placard which reads \u2018Pregnant? Need Help?\u2019 and is accompanied by a phone number. They have gathered to protest against abortion as part of a six-week \u2018vigil\u2019 organised by Texas-based group 40 Days For Life.\u00a0The group holds internationally-coordinated demonstrations around the world, twice a year - but this is the first since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade in June, after which a dozen US states banned abortion in almost all circumstances.\u00a0And, since the demonstration began in September, anti-abortion protesters have gathered in more than a dozen other cities across Britain, including Leeds, Reading, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Cardiff, Liverpool, Southampton and Brighton - hundreds of volunteers operating a rota system to ensure a round-the-clock presence.\"We have seen an increase in protests outside clinics since Roe was overturned. It feels like they've been emboldened. As though they think this is their time,\" says Katherine O\u2019Brien at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas), the UK\u2019s largest abortion provider.\u00a0Supporters of 40 Days for Life now stand accused of using US-style tactics to harass women as they enter clinics, including encouraging them to take so-called \u2018abortion reversal pills\u2019. These contain high levels of progesterone to, it is claimed, counter the effects of the medically approved abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. Also known as 'telemedicine' or 'pills by post', these were widely adopted during the pandemic, so women could manage their own abortions - within the first ten weeks of pregnancy - at home.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tProtesters in favour of abortion rights at the US Embassy in London in June this year following the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v Wade\n\t\t\t\n\nCredit:  Vudi Xhymshiti/Anadolu \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nOn August 30 this year, the telemedicine system became permanent in England and Wales, meaning that it now tends to be the most vulnerable who attend clinics in person: under-16s, women experiencing abuse, or those who have had a diagnosis of foetal anomaly in a wanted pregnancy. It is they who have to run the gauntlet of the protestors standing outside.There have been fresh concerns that this so-called \u2018reversal\u2019 treatment may be offered at a new \u2018crisis pregnancy centre\u2019 which opened last month in Edinburgh and is funded by US group Stanton Healthcare, founded by US Christian activist Brandi Swindell and which has links to anti-abortion organisations. Its website promises to give women \u2018alternatives to abortion\u2019 but a spokesperson tells me that \u201cthere are no plans to offer abortion pill reversal\u201d.On its website, 40 Days for Life falsely states that \u2018one in ten [women] experience immediate complications (many of them life-threatening) after taking the abortion pill.\u2019 Yet NHS guidance makes it clear that just 1 in 1,000 abortions will have serious complications, such as heavy bleeding, while 70 in 1,000 may need a secondary, usually minor, procedure. This summer, the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists debunked the effectiveness of so-called \u2018reversal pills\u2019, saying that there is \u201cno reputable evidence\u201d they work. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned that given improperly, progesterone can cause damage to the nervous, cardiovascular and endocrine systems. A 2020 medical trial was ended after several patients experienced serious haemorrhaging.\u00a0In an email, 40 Days for Life founder Shawn Carney - a 40-year-old Texan and father of eight - tells me that it is an \u201cabsurd claim that volunteers are handing out unregulated pills, when in fact, volunteers are simply providing information for alternatives to abortion and giving women a choice if they want other options.\u201d\u00a0He claims that since he started the group in 2004, it has \u2018saved\u2019 22,031 lives in 64 countries and persuaded 242 abortion workers to quit their jobs.\u00a0Granted charitable status last year, Stanton Healthcare already has a \u2018crisis centre\u2019 in Belfast which opened in 2015 and has previously been accused, by an undercover reporter, of wrongly telling women that abortion causes breast cancer (accusations it has denied).\u00a0It does offer free ultrasound scans, in an echo of the tactics I witnessed when visiting an abortion clinic in the US state of Missouri in 2019, where protestors in official-looking hi vis jackets outside the clinic would persuade women to instead visit their \u2018crisis center\u2019 - stationed down the road in a bus - for a free ultrasound scan in an attempt to persuade them to continue with their pregnancy. Pro-choice charities are concerned that, in the UK, this could amount to \u201creproductive coercion\u201d.\u201cIt is incredibly worrying that anti-abortion groups are peddling a medication that carries two significant risks,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \u201cFirstly, there is absolutely no evidence that this non-treatment works in terms of preventing miscarriage or, as they would describe it, \u2018reversing an abortion\u2019. Secondly, there is also a very real risk of haemorrhage from using these medications.\u00a0\u201cThis is an attempt to prevent abortion at any cost \u2013 including a woman\u2019s health and wellbeing. That protesters might be encouraging women to take potentially harmful medications is yet more evidence of the growing need for buffer zones.\u201dOn October 18\u00a0 MPs voted by 297 to 110 in favour of an amendment to the Government's Public Order Bill, which would introduce national buffer zones and make it a criminal offence punishable by up to six months in prison to harass, obstruct or interfere with any woman attending an abortion clinic or any member of staff.It still has several stages to clear before becoming law, including going through the Lords.\u00a0Jessica Bone of Sister Supporter, a British advocacy group that campaigns for buffer zones, points out that to achieve this nation-wide \u201cgoing to be hard work, given everything else that\u2019s going on in the political sphere\u201d.\u00a0Parliamentary documents previously revealed that US-funded anti-abortion group The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children had written letters in the hopes of influencing Parliament to drop the amendment.In Scotland, a buffer-zone battle has also broken out. Nicola Sturgeon recently backed the development of a bill - also supported by the British Medical Association and Royal College of GPs - to introduce them for all clinics in the country. 40 Days For Life has said that it would be prepared to help mount a legal challenge to Scottish buffer zones, prompting Sturgeon to respond: \"Am I surprised that they want to try and export that to other countries and to stir up the same sort of opposition to women's rights? No, I am not. But I am pretty determined that I will do everything I can to resist it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t40 Days for Life protesters outside a Marie Stopes clinic in London, in 2010\n\t\t\t\n\nCredit: Susannah Ireland/REX/Shutterstock\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, campaigners and abortion care workers emphasise that such measures are needed more than ever. 40 Days For Life may claim that its supporters are engaged in \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d including prayer, singing and fasting, but since the current demonstrations began on September 28, clinics around Britain have experienced what many describe as \u201charassment\u201d.\u00a0\u201cIt does feel like something is shifting,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \u201cProtestors are turning up at clinics where we haven\u2019t seen them before and being increasingly aggressive: standing outside the doors, directly approaching women with leaflets containing medically inaccurate information,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \u201cWe've had baby booties lined up in bushes. And they pray so loudly that you can hear them in the consultation rooms. It\u2019s incredibly distressing. The women we\u2019re treating can come in close to panic attacks, in tears and really frightened.\u201dThe current rhetoric of anti-abortion groups is keen to link the US and UK. On September 3, Carney flew to London ahead of the vigils to join a \u2018March for Life\u2019 and deliver a speech to a crowd of cheering supporters. \u201cGreetings from a post-Roe United States of America!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWe were able to overturn the law. If we can do it, you can do it.\u201d\u00a0O\u2019Brien confirms that US anti-abortion groups are actively recruiting in the UK, including younger members. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly through churches and religious networks,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes churches will organise marches to the local abortion clinic, so they can have a vigil outside with the congregation. That increases numbers significantly.\u201dWhile the global trend edges towards decriminalisation, in Britain abortion remains illegal outside the 23 weeks and 6 day limit, and without the consent of two doctors. Two women in England are currently facing life sentences for ending their pregnancies outside these parameters. And while the Northern Ireland ban was overturned in 2019, the abortion service has yet to be commissioned - meaning 161 women travelled to England and Wales for terminations last year.There are voices of dissent within the Government. Following the overturning of Roe, Conservative MP Danny Kruger said he didn\u2019t agree that women had \u201can absolute right to bodily autonomy.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that he would favour halving the time limit in the UK to 12 weeks, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey has voted against abortion rights and Jacob Rees-Mogg has said abortion is never justifiable, even in cases of rape.\u00a0Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has abstained on all major votes linked to abortion rights since becoming an MP in 2015 - including last month's buffer zone amendment - only casting a pro-abortion vote in April 2021, voting in favour of giving the Northern Ireland secretary powers to commission abortion services there.Katherine O\u2019Brien thinks we can\u2019t afford to be complacent.\u201cWe are a pro-choice country, but there's a growing number of extremists targeting women and the Government's inaction reinforces the idea that what they're doing is morally and socially acceptable.\u201cWe can see that this is the direction of travel, so we in Britain have to stop and think 'Is this where we want to go?\u2019\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReligion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen\u2019s rights\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment speech bubble icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense this content\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n                    The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.
