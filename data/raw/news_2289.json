This campaign will tick off a lot of people, but at the same time it\u2019s going to challenge them and make them think,\u201d said Lisa Noble, who became executive director of the group late last year.\n\u201cAlmost any person you talk to that isn\u2019t familiar with the pro-life movement is shocked when they hear that you can get an abortion up to nine months. We have to spread the message wide that not only is it true, you\u2019re paying for it as well.\u201d\nEdmonton Prolife\u00a0has organized protests, distributed pamphlets and displayed educational booths against abortion for more than 30 years. The $50,000 \u201cDid You Know?\u201d campaign will be the largest in the organization\u2019s history.\nIt\u2019s a bold move that fits right into Noble\u2019s personality. Noble joined Edmonton Prolife in 2017, and she hopes to expand its mission. No matter the backlash against the pro-life movement, Noble pulls no punches.\n\u201cPeople can end up yelling, screaming, swearing at me \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 it\u2019s fine. I stand my ground,\u201d she said. \u201cI have pretty thick skin. You have to realize that most of the time people don\u2019t know any better. They haven\u2019t been exposed to the full reality of abortion and that\u2019s just what we have to show people.\u201d\nIn Canada abortion is legal at any stage of pregnancy, although the vast majority are done before the 20th\u00a0week.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to see an end to abortion all together, but I know it\u2019s not something that will happen overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we make the noise and bring attention to the truth, I believe in my lifetime we could see the end of late-term abortions in Canada. That would be an important first step.\u201d\nBorn and raised in Newfoundland, Noble first felt a calling to the pro-life movement at age 14 when a high school classmate gave a presentation on abortion.\n\u201cShe told this story from the baby\u2019s point of view, from the time it was conceived until it was aborted,\u201d Noble recalled. \u201cShe would detail the stages of growth, when it developed fingers, toes, everything. Then, when the baby was aborted, she described all the things that baby would feel.\n\u201cAt that point in my life I didn\u2019t have a clue about any of these things. And hearing this story, it almost made me want to throw up,\u201d Noble said.\u00a0\nThirty years later, and having raised three children of her own, Noble hopes to become a leading voice in the pro-life cause, with\u00a0 the most important goal being the closure of abortion clinics.\nNoble expects pushback against the \u201cDid You Know?\u201d campaign, but the biggest obstacle is apathy.\n\u201cNothing will ever change if we just say we\u2019re pro-life and leave it at that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t drive by an abortion clinic, knowing babies are being killed there every day, and just be OK with it because, well, at least some of us are pro-life. We just can\u2019t. At the end of the day, we have to try and save those babies.\u201d\n(Grandin Media) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under:\n\nprolife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\nCare, not killing enshrined in March for Life\n\n\nItaly's prime minister takes case of baby on life support to highest levels of diplomacy\n\n\n\u2018Religious women\u2019 have more kids, study shows\n\n\nPro-lifers censored, challenge claims\n\n\nPro-life program helps with challenges of choosing life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in this category:\n\n\t\t\t\u00ab Pain, hope, healing on ministry frontlines\t\t\n\n\t\t\tWorld Day sets sights on reconciliation \u00bb\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease support The Catholic Register\nUnlike many media companies,\u00a0The Catholic Register\u00a0has never charged readers for access to the news and information on our website.
