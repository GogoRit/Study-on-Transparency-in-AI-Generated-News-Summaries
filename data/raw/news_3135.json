(CNS photo/Tyler Orsburn)On the latest episode of the Gloria Purvis Podcast, Gloria speaks with Cherilyn Holloway, the founder of Pro-Black Pro-Life, an organization that aims to build trust and open the line of effective communication around difficult issues.In their conversation, Gloria and Cherilyn debunk myths around Black women, Black motherhood and Black poverty. They also talk about how the voices of Black people are often overlooked or tokenized within the pro-life movement and how pro-life stances have become entangled with partisan politics. Finally, Gloria and Cherilyn question the racist stereotype that Black women are more eager to get abortions than other women.This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.Gloria Purvis: I think people probably hear Pro-Black Pro-Life and think, \u201cWhat?\u201d Can you help people understand what you experienced in the pro-life movement that made you realize, \u201cYou know, there needs to be the emphasis that there is a part of the movement that\u2019s pro-Black\u201d?Cherilyn Holloway: In 2017, I became the executive director of my local pregnancy center. But they didn\u2019t really talk about the issues as \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice.\u201d It was just like, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help women choose life instead of abortion.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until I accepted that job where I was like: \u201cOh, well, yeah, this is what I am. I am pro-life.\u201d The racial issue didn\u2019t really come up until about 2018, when I went to a pro-life women\u2019s conference and got some statistics on abortion in the Black community. And I was floored by the numbers. And I just kept thinking to myself, \u201cThis is so odd that nobody in the Black community is talking about this.\u201dGP: One of the things I think you and I have talked about before is how Black people are presented or perceived within the [pro-life] movement. Can you talk a little bit about that?CH: When I would go to [pro-life] different conferences, the only time I would see Black people even presented with a microphone is if they were either post-abortive or they had left an abortion clinic. There wasn\u2019t anyone [represented] who entered into this movement via their religious beliefs or just their own personal moral beliefs that [a fetus] is a human life. It was always kind of like, \u201cLook who we rescued.\u201d It was very easy for people to become tokenized, right? The reality is that the moment you kind of stepped out of their little box [by also talking about racism] then it was like: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute. This is not what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201dThe moment you kind of stepped out of their little box [by also talking about racism] then it was like: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute. This is not what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201dWith Pro-Black Pro-Life I have created this platform where there is no political alliance. We are a ministry, we are Christian, but we are here for everybody. We want there to be a space for you to be able to wrestle through all racial injustice, including racial injustice within the womb.GP: I know there are gonna be people saying: \u201cBut why pro-Black? What does that even mean?\u201dCH: It means that we are here for the advancement of the Black community, and we care about family. We care about your children. We care about education. We care about health care. We care about all the systemic racial issues that are happening in the Black community. And we want to help build up the Black community to help itself from within.We have done a crappy job\u2014specifically the churches in these communities\u2014of embracing them, specifically single mothers. You cannot say how terrible single motherhood is and then expect people to want to be single mothers when they find themselves unwed and pregnant. Where is the discipleship? Where are we walking alongside these women and saying: \u201cYes, this happened. We\u2019re gonna walk alongside you, and we\u2019re going to help you create a better life for yourself and your child when it comes to your relationship with Christ\u201d?You cannot say how terrible single motherhood is and then expect people to want to be single mothers when they find themselves unwed and pregnant.GP: People really [believe that] if you are pro-life, you\u2019re a conservative Republican, and if you are pro-choice or pro-abortion, you\u2019re a Democrat. Do you think that that also weighs heavily into how Black people see the movement and why they may or may not get involved in the pro-life side? CH: Absolutely. Because people are watching Fox News, they\u2019re seeing clips on their Facebook feed and thinking like: \u201cThis is ridiculous. This person doesn\u2019t know anything about the Black community.\u201d Or: \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t speak for me, and they\u2019re pro-life. And I care about abortion, but I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m like that person.\u201d The first question people always ask me is, \u201cDid you vote for Trump?\u201d And they ask me that for themselves\u2014not for me. They\u2019re trying to decide whether they like me or not. And I refuse to answer.GP: I know you\u2019re not Catholic, but I\u2019m curious what advice you have for a community like the Catholic Church, which is really just as divided as Americans are more broadly.CH: I would just say, don\u2019t be afraid. This whole idea that it\u2019s \u201ctoo much, it\u2019s too much to care about....\u201d\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do! And so being able to have courage enough to stand in the gap for what is right\u2014you do it while you\u2019re afraid until you\u2019re no longer afraid. And that\u2019s what I started doing. I had talked to a bunch of people that were pro-life [and] realized that most of them were on the same page with me with the whole pro-Black thing. It\u2019s not anti-white. It\u2019s not.I had talked to a bunch of people that were pro-life [and] realized that most of them were on the same page with me with the whole pro-Black thing. It\u2019s not anti-white.GP: This is a very important point to emphasize because too often, when people say pro-Black, it is perceived as anti-white because there is a pro-white movement that is decidedly anti-Black. And people can\u2019t see that Black people live in this country under different terms than white people do. To say you\u2019re pro-Black does not mean you are anti-white. It means you love the Black community, which for far too long has been an object of derision.When I first saw \u201cPro-Black Pro-Life,\u201d I immediately got it. But I realized there are also voices that have been elevated in the [pro-life] movement that have Black faces, but their messages are decidedly antagonistic toward Black movements of justice.CH: The thing I had to realize is that I\u2019m not here for the pro-life community. I reach outside for the pro-life community. I never needed a mic handed to me from someone within the pro-life community to be able to speak or have a platform because that was never God\u2019s intention for me. My job is to get people to have a full understanding and awareness of [abortion issues] while they\u2019re caring about everything else. So when they see police brutality or hear about the mortality rate of Black mothers giving birth, and when they get enraged about that, they can get enraged about what\u2019s happened in the Black community when it comes to abortion.I\u2019m not here for the pro-life community.\u00a0I never needed a mic handed to me from someone within the pro-life community to be able to speak because that was never God\u2019s intention for me.GP: Do you think that because our community experiences racism, these kinds of attacks against our being, there\u2019s a natural receptivity to the desire to defend life in the womb?CH: Absolutely. I have these two-hour conversations with groups of Black women, groups of Black men, and they always start off disagreeing with me. I\u2019m getting ready to step in front of someone\u2019s choice\u2014that\u2019s what they\u2019re thinking. But you\u2019re not \u201ctaking the choice away.\u201d You\u2019re bringing them the truth.\u00a0GP: The notion that poor Black women don\u2019t want their children, or that poor Black women somehow are unfairly handcuffed to poverty because of having children\u2014the narrative that we want these abortions is a false one. It\u2019s being put on us in the name of \u201cfreedom,\u201d in the name of being \u201cupwardly mobile.\u201d And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having a conversation saying, \u201cLook, this is the deal.\u201dCH: You also have to be willing to let people ask you questions and let them ask you questions that are very difficult. I have a friend who was told that her son had a 30 percent chance to live, multiple times during her pregnancy. And her fear was like, \u201cIf I give birth to this baby and the baby\u2019s not alive, I\u2019m gonna be crushed, and I already have another baby I\u2019ve gotta take care of.\u201d Her son is 7. [Talking to people about abortion involves] breaking down to them all the lies we\u2019ve been fed, and how we just so naturally believe that if it\u2019s legal, everything must be okay\u2014which we know is not true.More: Pro-Life / Abortion / Racial Justice / RacismGloria PurvisGloria Purvis is host of The Gloria Purvis Podcast from America Media.
