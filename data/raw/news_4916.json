Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe vs. Wade in June, it left the legality of abortion up to individual states. In Wisconsin, an abortion ban first enacted in 1849 immediately took effect, and legal abortion in the state virtually ended.\u201cIt has been a really historic year,\u201d said Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin president and CEO Tanya Atkinson, reflecting on the changes made to the decades-long precedent of the right to an abortion. It was an equally momentous year for people who oppose abortion. \n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJune 24, 2022, is the day that pro-lifers have dreaming for decades,\u201d said Matt Sande, legislative director for ProLife Wisconsin. Looking ahead to 2023, advocates on both sides of the issue are planning to pursue further changes to the state\u2019s laws regarding abortion. Planned Parenthood changes courseStarting in June, Zoie Hawpetoss began a new job at Planned Parenthood: \u201cabortion patient navigator.\u201d She works with people seeking help to determine what abortion services they\u2019re eligible for. She also helps make out-of-state appointments and provide financial assistance and logistical support for those trips. The patient navigators can be reached directly, and Hawpetoss said she is often a patient\u2019s first point of contact.  \u201cSometimes people\u2019s emotions are running a little bit high, and they\u2019re stressed out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sometimes it just starts as simple as just listening to them and getting them more calm.\u201dThe month before Roe was overturned, about 25 Wisconsinites had abortions performed in Illinois. Since Wisconsin\u2019s ban was reinstated in June, an average of nearly 300 Wisconsin abortion-seekers traveled to Illinois each month.Hawpetoss said many of those people face \u201csignificant barriers,\u201d and it\u2019s her job to help with things like travel, hotel bookings and child care. \u201cI think I have the train schedule memorized from Milwaukee to Chicago,\u201d she said.Planned Parenthood\u2019s health centers in the state all remain open and are still offering reproductive care services, STD testing, birth control, cancer screenings, and other services. The centers in Madison and Milwaukee that used to provide abortion services are still providing the care needed before and after an abortion, just not the procedure itself. More than a dozen health care providers from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin are now traveling to Illinois to provide abortion services. \u201cIf you need an abortion, you can still contact Planned Parenthood,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cPlanned Parenthood can still be there to support you to access that abortion in another state, whether that\u2019s Illinois, or whether perhaps you have a support system somewhere else in the country.\u201dPlanned Parenthood will continue to fight the state\u2019s abortion ban, Atkinson said, specifically by supporting democratic state Attorney General Josh Kaul\u2019s effort to overturn the 1849 statute that criminalizes abortion in nearly all cases.ProLife Wisconsin seeks further changes  Anti-abortion advocates also have plans to make further changes to the state\u2019s existing abortion laws. According to Sande, ProLife Wisconsin plans to pursue legislation that would adjust the language of the current abortion ban.The existing ban does not apply to abortion that \u201cis necessary, or is advised by 2 other physicians as necessary, to save the life of the mother,\u201d which critics say is not specific enough to be medically useful. \u201cWe would like to tighten up that vague and undefined \u2018life of the mother\u2019 language, and essentially replace it with an equal care language requirement requiring equal care for mother and child,\u201d Sande said. The organization also plan to pursue state funding for adoption tax credits and so-called \u201cpregnancy resource centers,\u201d which some experts say are inadequate to meet the needs of pregnant people and may even promote misinformation. Much of the issue\u2019s future in the state will come down to the spring election for an open seat on the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, Sande said. That election could flip the ideology of the conservative-leaning court, opening pathways to overturn the 1849 ban. \u201cThis is a big one, because it\u2019s an abortion referendum,\u201d said Sande. Still, Sande said he feels \u201cthankfulness and joy\u201d for the changes that have already been made in 2022. According to an analysis of a national study by the University of Wisconsin Collaborative for Reproductive Equity, health care providers have not performed any abortions in the state since the fall of Roe vs. Wade. \u201cIn April and May of 2022, Wisconsin abortion providers reported 590 and 620 abortions, respectively. In July and August, those numbers fell to zero,\u201d it said. \n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood to resume abortion services in Sheboygan \n\n \n\n\n\nAfter latest ruling, what abortion restrictions still exist in Wisconsin? \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA vows to appeal Dane County ruling on Wisconsin abortion law \n\n \n\n\n\nAnti-abortion groups urge DAs in Milwaukee, Dane counties to prosecute abortion providers \n\n \n\n\n\nAppointments fill up quickly as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin resumes abortions \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
