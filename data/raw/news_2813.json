GoshayThe RepositoryCANTON\u00a0 A local group has launched its extended fall protest against\u00a0abortion in hopes of\u00a0educating\u00a0women on alternatives, its organizers say.On Wednesday morning, members of\u00a040 Days for Life took up their posts on the sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood's Canton\u00a0clinic at 2663 Cleveland Ave. NW, where they will conduct informational pickets for the next 40 days.It's the 23rd year for the\u00a0campaign, which is conducted in the spring and the fall. And it comes at a critical time with a now open Supreme Court seat.\"We're out here because we're looking to let people know they have options,\"\u00a0said Paul Crowley of Waynesburg. \"Although they don't do abortions here, they make referrals, sell\u00a0and fund abortions\u00a0here.\"As Crowley spoke,\u00a0traffic whizzed by, with some drivers punctuating the air with horn blasts.Crowley, a board member of Stark County Right to Life, said\u00a0pickets will be conducted every day\u00a0from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. until Nov. 1.Though 40 Days for Life is nonpartisan, Crowley said he personally\u00a0supports President Donald Trump and his decision to appoint a Supreme Court Justice prior to the November election. Trump's top contenders include two\u00a0women jurists who are opposed to legalized abortion.Linda Warren of Plain Township has served as the local leader of 40 Days For Life since 2010. She said she got involved after her daughter saw\u00a0a pro-life gynecologist.\u00a0\"I've been on the sidewalk\u00a0ever since,\" she said.Warren said the group not only opposes abortion, but it also tries\u00a0to educate\u00a0women on alternatives where they can get the services and screenings,\u00a0such as mammograms, they need.\"We want them (women) to have places to go and be healthy,\" she said.Regarding the contention that a woman has a right to choose, Warren and Crowley said the argument ignores a key point.\"When a woman is pregnant, there are two bodies,\" she said.Crowley said 40 Days for Life demonstrates in front of Planned Parenthood clinics as a means to communicate with potential clients.\u00a0\"I find it more effective to come here because when they come here, they're looking for options,\" he said. \"At the same time, Planned Parenthood is looking to fill its abortion quotas. They're looking to increase abortions, not decrease them.\"Studies show\u00a0abortion rates have reached a 40-year low in the U.S. The Ohio Department of Health reports that\u00a01.43 million abortions were performed in the state from\u00a01976 to 2018, including 40,122 Stark Countians.ODH also reports that 559\u00a0Stark County women underwent the procedure in 2018, including 381 whites, 114 Blacks\u00a0and 64 women from other races.A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll reports that\u00a077 percent of Americans want abortion to remain legal, but of that number, 26 percent want more restrictions. Just 13 percent of Americans polled want to see the law overturned.\u00a0Warren said she thinks abstinence education may be a factor in the decline in abortion rates. And\u00a0more women have access to the \"morning-after\" pill.Warren, who said she does research using\u00a0Planned Parenthood's own annual reports, contends that the agency's health services for women and\u00a0its distribution\u00a0of contraceptives have decreased.Birth control, Warren said, gives women \"a false sense of security,\"\u00a0citing a Guttmacher Institute analysis which found that half of the women who get abortions used some form birth control during the month in which\u00a0they became pregnant.Asked how picketing helps their cause, Warren replied, \"It's covered in prayer.\"\"We want what is best for women. We want them to be healthy,\" she said.\u00a0Crowley, 36, said he has been involved in the anti-abortion movement since attending his first March for Life in 2008. He said he hopes other millennial men will step forward.\"I come out here because there's a need for pro-life men,\" Crowley said. \"Who's to say that someone driving by\u00a0won't change their mind? I feel this is part of my calling in life...men are the forgotten victims of abortion. Their tears are the ones no one sees.\"As some people\u00a0walked into the clinic, Warren and Crowley said 40 Days for Life, which is a nationwide, grassroots network, condemns the tactics of activists who harass and threaten women.\"If they do, they're not with 40 Days for Life,\" Crowley said.\"There's no anger, no condemnation,\" Warren said. \"Who am I to judge?\"Nearby, an unidentified passerby stopped and briefly shared her own abortion experience with the protesters.\u00a0They gave her some reference materials.\"If we weren't here, that wouldn't have happened,\" Warren said. \"We're here to bear witness to the humanity of the unborn children, and to help women.\"Planned Parenthood Ohio spokeswoman Laurel Powell offered the following statement:\u201cPlanned Parenthood is proud to be a longtime provider of compassionate, inclusive reproductive and sexual health care for patients at our Canton health center and across Ohio. We\u2019re committed to meeting the health care needs of these patients, so in recent months, we\u2019ve invested in our health centers, expanding our existing services to include telehealth appointments, flu vaccinations, and much more.
