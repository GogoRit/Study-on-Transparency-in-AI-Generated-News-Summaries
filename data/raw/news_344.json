But a closer look at other European countries shows the trend does not go towards liberalisation either, while at EU level, the European Commission is legally unarmed.\nThe protest against a strict abortion ban in Poland continues and is now turning into an anti-government movement.\nIn a country where the overwhelming majority supports termination of pregnancies in case of foetal abnormalities, demonstrations were just a matter of time. However, the outrage is directed not only at the judges who cleared the law, but also at the ruling Law and Justice party that de facto controls the court.\nThe Polish Church, which was previously considered an inviolable authority, is also the target of mostly young demonstrators, some of them dressed as handmaids.\n\u201cIt started with the abortion law as an incentive for expressing this anger,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, co-founder of All-Polish Women\u2019s Strike, the key force behind the protests\n\u201cBut right now it\u2019s about everything,\u201d she told EURACTIV Poland.\n\n\n\nPolish Ombudsman: 'Rule of law has not applied to abortion in Poland'\nA referendum on abortion under the current conditions in which the ruling party has unlimited possibilities for propaganda and debate in the public media, would not give room for real and in-depth discussion, Adam Bodnar, told \n\nPoland closer to total ban on abortion after top court ruling\nIn today\u2019s edition of the Capitals, find out more about the failed attempt of Spanish far-right party Vox to oust Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s government, \u2018Poland\u2019s highest court making it even harder to get an abortion in the country legally, and so much more.\n\n\nIt is estimated that around 100,000 Polish women travel abroad each year to get an abortion, according to UN experts, often to neighbouring Germany or Czech Republic, where terminations are much easier to obtain.\nAt the same time, there is a gap between legal abortions taking place in a medical environment and so-called \u201cclandestine or informal abortions\u201d, which the UN estimates between 80,000 and 180,000 per year. The Polish government claims this number is fewer than 10,000.\nIn early November, members of the Polish Left wrote a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, requesting the EU executive to act on tightening the anti-abortion law in Poland. A similar letter was sent to Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli.\nA Commission spokesperson confirmed to EURACTIV the letter had been received and a reply would be provided \u201cin due course\u201d.\nAsked whether the restriction of abortion rights is in accordance with European values and EU fundamental rights, the Commission referred to the EU treaties. \u201cFrom a legal perspective, let me remind that according to the treaties, the EU has no competence on abortion right and legislation in this area is up to member states,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson, however, recalled the words of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said earlier this year that \u201cstrong women\u2019s rights are an asset and an achievement for the whole of Europe\u201d.\n\u201cBacksliding is not an option for a continent that aims for winning the future,\u201d von der Leyen added, saying: \u201cProgress is hard won, but easily lost\u201d.\nA look around Europe\nAbortion laws vary greatly across the EU\u2019s 27 member states, from a complete ban, to allowing it only under certain conditions, putting legal restrictions on it, or letting women freely choose whether or not to have an abortion.\nOnly Malta and a few micro-states like Andorra and San Marino currently have more restrictive abortion laws than Poland.\nA woman who terminates her pregnancy in Malta risks a prison sentence of up to three years, even if she became pregnant by a rapist or if the pregnancy endangers her health or life.\u00a098% of the country is Catholic and divorce was still illegal in the country until 2011.\nCountries like Ireland and Cyprus have liberalised to allow abortion up to certain gestational limits.\nIreland, where the Catholic Church has a strong influence on the assessment of moral issues as well as on politics and legislation, had one of the strictest abortion bans in the EU, under which women could face sentences of up to fourteen years if they terminated a pregnancy.\nA protracted debate in Ireland led to a public referendum on constitutional reform. That led to the rule\u2019s abolition in 2018, paving way for a modernised legal framework for abortion rights in Ireland.\nPublic opinion was additionally heavily influenced by the damaged reputation of the Catholic Church due to cases of abuse and their handling of them.\nUnder the new rules, abortion in the country became legal if conducted within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After this period, abortion is permitted in cases where a women\u2019s life or health is at risk or if is the possibility of a fatal foetal abnormality.\nIreland\u2019s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar described the vote as the culmination of a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d in the deeply Catholic country.\n\nFurther east, the debate is getting more polarised. Central and Eastern European countries in particular have seen multiple attempts to reduce women\u2019s legal entitlements to abortion or to introduce new barriers.\nSlovakia\u2019s\u00a0parliament earlier this month voted against proposed restrictions that would have required women to wait 96 hours before an abortion, banned clinics from \u201cadvertising\u201d abortion services, and required women to justify their reasons for seeking an abortion.\nIt was one of several bills proposing restrictions on reproductive rights that were rejected in the country\u2019s parliament in 2019 and 2020.\nThe\u00a0Netherlands are among the most liberal Western European countries with a deadline of 24 weeks. After talking to a doctor, a woman only has to wait a five-day cooling-off period before being treated in a clinic.\n\nMost EU countries allow\u00a0abortion\u00a0on demand up to 10 or 14 weeks of pregnancy, including\u00a0France, Belgium, Denmark, and\u00a0Greece. The deadlines are pushed out for cases of rape or foetal abnormality, but information dissemination or advertising by service providers is banned or regulated.\nWhile\u00a0Portugal\u00a0has similar timelines, it has tightened its laws in other ways, requiring women to have counselling first and pay for the procedure.\nAccording to Eurostat,\u00a0more than half of the EU\u2019s member states have experienced a gradual decline in\u00a0abortions\u00a0during the last decade.\nIn the case of the UK, France and Germany, which have the most abortions in absolute terms, figures have remained relatively stable, but reached 622,480 in 2018 only in these four countries, with France in the lead.\nHowever, the liberalisation of abortion is being called into question again in many Catholic countries in Europe and the new restrictive Polish laws are a model for conservative parties in Slovakia, Italy, Spain or Croatia who want to reverse liberal deadline solutions.\nPro-life \u2018Geneva Consensus\u2019\nAcross the world, the pro-life movement seems to be gaining strength. According to the latest figures 26 countries around the world prohibit abortion altogether, including Congo-Brazzaville, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Madagascar, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Palau, Philippines, Senegal and Suriname.\nIn October, 32 countries signed the Geneva Consensus Declaration, a pledge to protect women and defend life.\nThe controversial document, co-sponsored by the US, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Hungary and Uganda, states that \u201cthere is no international right to abortion\u201d while tackling the promotion of equal rights for women and the need for universal health coverage.\nThe other signatories were Bahrain, Belarus, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Djibouti, Eswatini, Gambia, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Libya, Nauru, Niger, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Zambia.\n(Edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon.
