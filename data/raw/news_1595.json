(AP) \u2014 The South Carolina Senate passed an abortion ban on Thursday in the Republican-led chamber\u2019s latest quest to craft a law that passes constitutional muster, but differences with a stricter proposal from the House could derail the effort once again.Republicans have faced several setbacks in their efforts to further restrict abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal protections this summer, allowing the conservative state\u2019s previous ban to take effect.First, a special session spanning a dozen meetings throughout the summer and fall resulted in no new ban when neither chamber budged from their respective proposals. Then, just days before lawmakers convened this January, the state\u2019s highest court narrowly struck down a 2021 law banning abortion after cardiac activity is detected around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWith Thursday\u2019s 28-12 vote, Senate Republicans insist they have found their solution in a ban on abortions after cardiac activity is detected around six weeks of pregnancy. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey emphasized that several clarifications of the bill\u2019s language and repeals of conflicting laws will satisfy a majority on the South Carolina Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s top public health doctor warns senators wrong lessons being learned from COVID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTighter proposed South Carolina budget would include raises for teachers and state workers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootball powers converge to support South Carolina athlete compensation bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate measure includes exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and the patient\u2019s life and health up to 12 weeks. Meanwhile, a full ban from conception has again advanced to the House floor in a development that threatens to prevent another abortion restriction from becoming law in South Carolina. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vote indicates that Senate Republicans\u2019 position has not changed since this fall. The overall body appears uninterested in pursuing any alternative restrictions \u2014 lesser or greater. Republican Sen. Sandy Senn\u2019s amendment to instead bar abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy failed to pass. Sen. Richard Cash, one of the Legislature\u2019s most vocal abortion opponents, withdrew his amendment that would have matched the House proposal.\n\nSenators moved quickly to advance the long-sought Republican priority. Republican leadership bypassed the traditional committee process to hold a vote this week on the bill. Massey said additional public input was unnecessary given the mountain of testimony over years of hearings on the issue.Supporters said the court\u2019s January decision added urgency to prevent the state from serving as what Republican Sen. Billy Garrett called an \u201cabortion haven.\u201dBut in doing so, some of the five women in the chamber said the Senate failed to address key nuances in the fraught subject. Democratic Sen. Margie Bright Matthews called the effort a \u201cknee jerk\u201d reaction by the \u201cheavy hand of a bunch of men.\u201dSenn suggested the rush came at the proposal\u2019s own legal expense.\u201cThere\u2019s no way the court can make an informed decision with the scant legislative record,\u201d Senn said Thursday, adding: \u201cIt was ramrodded through committee and it\u2019s been ramrodded on this floor.\u201dThe Charleston Republican was the only member of her party to ultimately vote against the ban. She and Massey sparred repeatedly this week as Senn attempted time after time to amend the bill.\n\nThe measure states outright that it does not ban contraception. One of Senn\u2019s failed amendments sought to explicitly name implants and emergency contraception like Plan B in the list of protected forms of birth control.Massey said the bill had been carefully crafted to ensure such contraception is allowed. Senn said a doctor had expressed concerns that the proposal\u2019s medical definitions could be interpreted to exclude certain forms like copper intrauterine devices.The measure also requires physicians to share a patient\u2019s name and contact information with the local sheriff in the event of an aborted pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. Another amendment sought to prevent that information\u2019s disclosure unless the patient consents.Sen. Mia McLeod noted that most victims do not report the crime. By requiring that physicians divulge that information, McLeod said the chamber seemed to have \u201cno appetite for balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason for that,\u201d Senn responded. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have balance until more women run and until more women get elected.\u201dIt was not the only time the lack of women got attention this week.The stark gender divide that unfolded in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s summer decision reemerged as Senn and the other four other senators repeatedly called attention to their minority status in the 46-member chamber.\u201cDid you know that with us five women here in the state Senate, that there are millions -- literally millions -- of people here in South Carolina depending on the five of us to make sure this bill is just so?\u201d Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson asked Senn on Wednesday.Several key changes were made before its final passage. Judges would have discretion to impose sentences up to two years imprisonment and fines up to $10,000 for a physician in ownership of medical records who fails to properly maintain documentation relating to abortions. Another amendment made it clear that doctors do not need to delay emergency care necessary to save a patient\u2019s life or health by first taking an ultrasound to check for a heartbeat.\n\nThe bill would also repeal a 1974 law criminalizing people who seek abortions. While Massey said he had never heard of the statute\u2019s enforcement, the Senate wanted to remove the possibility altogether.Both Cash and Massey urged the lower chamber\u2019s Republican supermajority to pass their version.\u201cLet\u2019s take the win. And if you want to continue pushing for something more aggressive then so be it. But don\u2019t stop this one,\u201d Massey told reporters on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s at least save thousands of lives and we can continue talking about whether we can go further or not. But pass this bill.\u201d\u2014-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
