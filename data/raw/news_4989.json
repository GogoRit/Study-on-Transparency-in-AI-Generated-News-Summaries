Wade. (Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, abortion would be criminalized as a felony in Idaho 30 days after a court ruling is handed down.\u00a0\nFollowing Politico\u2019s publication last week of a leaked draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, political observers on all sides of the abortion debate are bracing for Idaho\u2019s so-called trigger law to take effect.\nBut at least one anti-abortion group, the Idaho Family Policy Center, will push to move beyond what\u2019s already in Idaho Code by advocating for a bill in the Idaho Legislature that would classify abortion as homicide or murder and remove exemptions for rape and incest.\u00a0\nIn 2020, the Idaho Legislature passed Senate Bill 1385, which would take effect 30 days after the issuance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that gives states the rights to regulate abortion. Idaho\u2019s trigger law would make it a felony to perform an abortion or attempt to perform an abortion. Breaking that law would be punishable with a prison sentence of a minimum of two years for the medical professional who performs the abortion. A first offense would also result in the suspension of the medical provider\u2019s professional license for six months, while a second offense would result in permanent revocation.\u00a0\nThe only carve outs in Idaho\u2019s law are to save a pregnant patient\u2019s life and for rape and incest if the patient has previously reported the rape or incest to law enforcement and provided a copy of the report to the physician performing the abortion.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n  Idaho groups respond to U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s leaked draft opinion \n\nAnti-abortion groups welcomed the draft opinion.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are excited for the the very real possibility that in less than a couple of months, abortion will be more or less unavailable in the state of Idaho,\u201d Idaho Family Policy Center President Blaine Conzatti said in a telephone interview. \u201cBecause of that, thousands of babies will have a chance to live their lives.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been expecting,\u201d Conzatti added. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades now that Roe v. Wade was bad constitutional law. The findings are not related in any way to the text or intent of the Constitution.\u201d\nDavid Adler, who has taught constitutional law at Idaho\u2019s three public universities and had writings quoted by the U.S. Supreme Court, said if the court overturns Roe v. Wade, it would be reversing a landmark precedent and turning control and oversight of women\u2019s reproductive health rights over to state governments.\u00a0\n\u201cThat would essentially eliminate a constitutional right to abortions for women,\u201d Adler said. \u201cIt eviscerates a woman\u2019s reproductive rights and, thus, turns the control over abortions back to each and every state. We already know many states have enacted trigger laws that would go into effect, Idaho included.\u201d\nAdler also pointed out the leaked opinion may or may not represent the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s final ruling. During the drafting process, Adler said it is often the case that drafts or even votes change as justices engage in horsetrading. For example, one justice may tell another justice they would join their opinion, but only if certain paragraphs were changed or removed.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is considerable negotiation among the justices, and there always has been,\u201d Adler said.\u00a0\n  Anti-abortion group hopes to pass law classifying abortion as murder in Idaho \n\nWhile he supports Alito\u2019s draft opinion and Idaho\u2019s trigger law criminalizing abortion 30 days after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Conzatti said he will push for the Idaho Legislature to make more stringent laws surrounding abortion.\n\u201cMany states treat abortion as felony murder. Ours is a looser one,\u201d Conzatti said. \u201cThat is an issue we are going to have to come back to. How do we tighten this up and ensure all life is equally protected in the state of Idaho?\u201d\nConzatti said he supports calling a special session of the Idaho Legislature to address the issue. Because the Idaho Legislature adjourned earlier this year, only the governor has the authority to convene a special session. Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has called for Idaho Gov. Brad Little to convene a special session and for legislators to remove exceptions for rape, incest and protecting the pregnant person\u2019s health if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you believe that life begins at conception, there can be no exceptions that allow for ending that life,\u201d McGeachin wrote on her campaign Facebook page Wednesday.\u00a0\nBut aside from McGeachin\u2019s call, Conzatti said he hasn\u2019t heard much of a push for a special session so far.\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s in campaign mode,\u201d Conzatti said, referencing the upcoming May 17 primary elections.\u00a0\nIdaho has other abortion laws on the books and in the courts, but Conzatti said the trigger law would take precedence if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\u00a0\nConzatti said he drafted Senate Bill 1309, the Texas-style law from this year\u2019s legislative session that gives family members of a pregnant woman the right to sue if a medical professional performs an abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Little signed the bill into law March 23, and Planned Parenthood quickly filed a petition with the Idaho Supreme Court asking to block the law and declare it unconstitutional. The Idaho Supreme Court put a temporary stay in place blocking the bill from becoming effective in April while the legal case is sorted out.\u00a0\nConzatti said he is not sure how legal cases will play out over the next few months, but he said Senate Bill 1309 would take a backseat to the trigger law criminalizing abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\u00a0\nConzatti also said the felony punishments from the trigger law are far more severe than a civil lawsuit from Senate Bill 1309.\u00a0\n\u201cThe way we wrote it is that the trigger law supersedes the heartbeat bill if both are made effective,\u201d Conzatti said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n  Legislative committee chair expresses openness to banning emergency contraception \n\nConzatti will likely have many allies within the Idaho Legislature on the issue.\nDuring the May 6 episode of the Idaho Public Television program \u201cIdaho Reports,\u201d Rep. Brent Crane, the chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, which is the legislative committee that considers abortion bills, said he would be open to holding a hearing on a bill to ban emergency contraception, Plan B, or intrauterine devices, or IUDs.\n\u201cPlan B, I probably would hear that legislation; IUDs I am not for certain yet where I would be on that particular issue,\u201d Crane said.\u00a0\nIn response to Crane, Rep. Lauren Necochea, D-Boise, said the trajectory among Republican policymakers is to continue pushing more and more extreme and invasive proposals. She also expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court\u2019s draft ruling.\u00a0\n\u201cI was devastated to hear this news,\u201d Necochea said. \u201cThis is a right that we have had in place for all of our lifetimes \u2026 For these past five decades, Roe v. Wade has protected Idahoans regardless of what extreme unconstitutional laws were proposed or enacted in Idaho, and those protections now go away, and I think we face a grim reality.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\n  Planned Parenthood plans abortion rights rally Saturday in Boise \n\nAs the leaked draft opinion has ignited debate about abortion rights in the U.S., many groups have organized protests throughout the country in response \u2013 and Idaho is no different.\nOfficials with Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates are planning a rally and march at 10:30 a.m. Saturday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.\u00a0\nOrganizers and abortion rights advocates say they are expecting the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has guaranteed a right to an abortion for 50 years.\u00a0\n\u201cSaturday\u2019s rally is part of a national day of action to send a clear and loud message to politicians who want to control our bodies and our lives: bans off our bodies,\u201d organizers of Saturday\u2019s rally said in a press release.\u00a0\n  Previous Idaho abortion bills made national news \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time abortion debates have become such central and pressing issues in Idaho and across the country. In 1990, the Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 625, which a 1990 article in the New York Times called \u201cthe most restrictive abortion law of any state.\u201d\nThe bill would have outlawed abortion except in cases of rape that were reported to law enforcement within seven days and cases of incest involving a victim under age 18, or in cases when the mother\u2019s health was threatened.\u00a0\nRepublicans and national anti-abortion groups, including the National Right to Life Committee, drafted House Bill 625 hoping it would become a test case to get Roe V. Wade back in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, said Marc C. Johnson, a longtime top aide to former Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a very intense and tense time where advocates on both sides of the issue were mobilizing in force,\u201d Johnson said.\u00a0\nAndrus was personally anti-abortion, and believed abortion was only acceptable in cases of rape and increase and when the pregnant woman\u2019s life was threatened, Johnson said.\u00a0\nBut Andrus vetoed the bill in the face of national attention.\u00a0\nIn a press conference announcing the veto, Andrus said the bill\u2019s restrictions \u201cfailed the test of reasonableness and compassion\u201d after noting that a rape victim would violate the abortion law if they didn\u2019t report the rape within the first seven days.\u00a0\n\u201cThis law would force the woman to compound the tragedy of rape,\u201d Andrus said in his announcement, which was broadcast nationally by C-SPAN.\u00a0\nIn his veto statement, Andrus railed against the bill\u2019s sponsors for working with national groups, outside of Idaho, who Andrus said pushed the bill for the sole purpose of getting an abortion case back before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u201cI believe and I am confident that the people of Idaho believe that we can make our own judgments on this terribly important issue without outside pressure, outside influence and threats,\u201d Andrus said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIdaho\u2019s abortion trigger law would take effect 30 days after Roe v.
