I am firmly opposed to abortion and will continue to do so.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe said he would urge the government to work hard to prepare a system for a culture of life, and the National Assembly to legislate for a culture of healthy life.\nThe new bill\nSouth Korea's government has adopted a draft law to legalize abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy. It adopted a bill on Oct. 7 that plans to plans to ban abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy except in the case of a sex crime or if it affects the mother's health or severe congenital disabilities for the fetus. The law bans abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, the Justice Ministry said.\nAlthough the government has adopted the bill, citizens have been given around 40 days to submit their views before it is sent to the National Assembly for approval. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea has been opposing the move to legalize abortion since August when the government was finalizing the draft bill.\nConscientious objection\nAfter reiterating the Church's unequivocal stand against abortion, Bishop Lee went on to urge the government to allow conscientious objection, reported The Korean Times.\nConscientious objection to abortion is the right of medical staff to refuse participation in abortion for personal belief. \u201cHealthcare workers,\u201d the CBCK president said, \u201cshouldn't be punished just because they refuse to perform an abortion procedure.\"\nCovid hardships\nAt Friday\u2019s press conference, Bishop Lee also touched upon other issues. Noting the hardships that people are facing, especially employees and small business owner, because of the pandemic, he urged for solidarity with them.\u00a0\nHe recalled Pope Francis\u2019 recent encyclical letter Fratelli tutti on fraternity and social friendship, saying it that the church should serve humanity.\u00a0\nTwo Koreas\nSpeaking about relations between the two Koreas, Bishop Lee expressed sadness that even after 70 years of the start of the Korean War, relations between the two neighbours were still tense. For the past 25 years, the Catholic Church in South Korea has been gathering every Tuesday at the feet of the Virgin Mary in Seoul Cathedral to implore the grace of reunification. With the help of this prayer, Bishop Lee hopes to make a concrete plan for inter-Korean reconciliation.\nOur \u201ccommon home\u201d\nThe new Korean bishops\u2019 president took up the issues of climate change and pollution amid the pandemic and infectious diseases. \u201cWe must strive to preserve our one and only earth well,\u201d he said citing Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical \u201cLaudato si\u2019\u201d.\nHe said the bishops \u201cwish to continue the movement to preserve the ecological environment and protect the earth, our common home\u201d.\n\nThank you for reading our article.
