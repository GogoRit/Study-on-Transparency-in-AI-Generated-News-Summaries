People of all different beliefs and backgrounds, including nonreligious and left-leaning and pro-science groups, will be raising their voices in unison in defense of the unborn. And though typically labeled as an \u201canti-abortion\u201d event, the march really represents so much more: a joyful, enthusiastic celebration of the inviolable dignity, fragile beauty, and unrepeatable mystery of every human life.\u00a0Whether you are on your way to Washington, DC or supporting the marchers from afar\u2014and whether you are pro-life, pro-choice, or unsure of where you stand\u2014here are 20 songs that capture the spirit of the pro-life movement, and hopefully inspire others to open their minds and hearts to its mission.[protected-iframe id=\u201d8f35469abedb0f521b303301e1298f71-95521100-92964681\u2033 info=\u201dhttps://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7dBAAHDJi3L8QGSS6b27zY\u201d width=\u201d300\u2033 height=\u201d380\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033]Trip Lee, \u201cBeautiful Life\u201dDrew Holcomb & The Neighbors, \u201cFamily\u201dBill Fay, \u201cTiny\u201d\u00a0Sam Martin, \u201cSong for My Unborn Son\u201dAlert312, \u201cLife\u2019s Wonderful\u201dMatisyahu, \u201cCircle of Life\u201dFr.
