activists stand outside the Oklahoma House chamber in Oklahoma City where Gov. Kevin Stitt delivers his State of the State address on February 7, 2022.\n\nAlonzo Adams/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\nRepublican-led states around the country have enacted a flurry of new restrictions on abortion, LGBTQ and transgender youth rights, and discussion of critical race theory.\n    \n\n            Here\u2019s a look at some of the legislation that has passed this session, what\u2019s next for the bills and what else is under consideration. The wave of activity on the state level comes ahead of a highly anticipated ruling by the US Supreme Court expected later this year that could have major implications for abortion.\n    \n\n    New abortion restrictions\n\n\nFlorida \u2013 Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure into law on April 14 that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The bill allows exemptions in cases where pregnancy poses \u201cserious\u201d health risks or fatal fetal abnormalities are detected if two physicians confirm the diagnoses in writing. What\u2019s next: The American Civil Liberties Union is promising to \u201ctake swift legal action\u201d to challenge the law before it goes into effect on July 1.\n    \n\nKentucky \u2013 The GOP-controlled state legislature overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s veto of a sweeping abortion bill on April 13 that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, restricts access to medication abortion and makes it more difficult for a minor to obtain an abortion in the state. The legislation does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. What\u2019s next: The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed lawsuits in federal court, arguing the law violates the Constitution.\n    \n\nOklahoma \u2013 Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a near-total ban on abortion into law on April 12, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. It would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by up to 10 years in state prison or a $100,000 fine, or both. The legislation would not provide exceptions in cases of rape and incest. What\u2019s next: The law takes effect 90 days after the state legislature adjourns in May.\n    \n\nTennessee \u2013 The Republican-led state House passed a bill on Thursday that would allow only physicians to provide drugs used in medication abortions and bar the drugs from being sent via mail. The legislation, House Bill 2416, would establish criminal penalties and civil liability for offenders that would not apply to the patient who was provided the abortion drugs. It would also require physicians to examine patients in person before providing the abortion drugs and to schedule follow-up visits for the patients. What\u2019s next: The bill now heads to the state Senate, where Republican lawmakers also have a majority.\n    \n\nWest Virginia \u2013 The GOP-controlled state House passed a bill on February 15 banning abortion after 15 weeks, except in a medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. It provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Republican Gov. Jim Justice also signed a bill on March 21 that would ban abortion if a pregnant person is seeking the procedure because the fetus has been diagnosed with or presumed to have a disability. The bill goes into effect in June and provides exceptions in medical emergencies or if the fetus is \u201cnonmedically viable.\u201d What\u2019s next: The 15-week abortion ban bill is now with the state Senate, where its passage would send it to Justice\u2019s desk.\n    \n\nIdaho \u2013 Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a bill modeled after the Texas law that bans abortions after embryonic or fetal cardiac activity has been detected, making Idaho the first state to follow the controversial Texas statute that allows private citizens to enforce the restrictions with lawsuits. What\u2019s next: The Idaho Supreme Court on April 8 temporarily blocked the law ahead of its April 22 implementation. \n    \n\nArizona \u2013 Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law legislation that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in some cases of medical emergency \u2013 becoming the first state this year to enact a ban after 15 weeks, following a similar law Mississippi passed in 2018 that the US Supreme Court seems poised to uphold this year. The bill offers no exceptions for cases of rape and incest.\n    \n\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota \u2013 Republican Gov. Kristi Noem on March 23 signed a law that will further restrict access to medication abortions in the state. The law makes South Dakota one of hardest places in the country to get abortion drugs, requiring pregnant women to make at least three trips to a clinic to obtain abortion medication. The measure, however, will not take effect immediately due to litigation. What\u2019s next: The law will not go into effect unless the judge\u2019s injunction is lifted, which Noem\u2019s administration is seeking through an appeal.\n    \n\n    New anti-LGBTQ and trans youth restrictions\n\n\nAlabama \u2013 Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law the state\u2019s own version of Florida\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law on April 8 after the legislature passed a surprise amendment to a transgender bathroom bill. The law will stop K-5 elementary teachers from \u201cinstruction\u201d on sexuality and gender. In addition to instructional limits, the bill requires students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that match the sex on their birth certificate. Ivey also signed SB 184 into law, which states medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care to minors could face up to 10 years in prison. What\u2019s next: The ACLU, on behalf of two families, has filed a lawsuit in federal court, asking it to strike down SB 184, banning gender-affirming care.\n    \n\nKentucky \u2013 The GOP-controlled state legislature has overridden Beshear after he vetoed a bill on April 6 that would prohibit transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at public and private schools in the state. The bill, dubbed the \u201cFairness in Women\u2019s Sports Act\u201d reads: \u201cAn athletic activity or sport designated as \u2018girls\u2019 for students in grades six through twelve shall not be open to members of the male sex.\u201d\n    \n\nPennsylvania \u2013 The Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted 115-84 on April 12 to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender. House Bill 972, known as the \u201cFairness in Women\u2019s Sports Act,\u201d states that sports or teams sponsored by a public school entity or institution must be designated as male, female or coed and that \u201cathletic or teams or sports designated for females, women or girls\u2026may not be open to students of the male sex.\u201d What\u2019s next: The bill heads to the state Senate, but Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has vowed to veto the legislation.\n    \n\nUtah \u2013 The GOP-controlled legislature on March 25 voted to override Republican Gov. Spencer Cox\u2019 veto of a bill that bans young transgender athletes from competing on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports teams. What\u2019s next: The ACLU has threatened to sue over the law, saying, \u201cLitigation to stop H.B. 11 from taking effect is now both necessary and inevitable.\u201d\n    \n\nFlorida \u2013 DeSantis on March 28 signed legislation banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom, approving a controversial measure that opponents have dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law.  HB 1557, titled the Parental Rights in Education bill, was given final passage by Florida\u2019s GOP-controlled Legislature last month. What\u2019s next: Two LGBTQ rights advocacy groups, as well as students, parents and a teacher in Florida, filed a federal lawsuit in late March challenging the new law and seeking to block its implementation and enforcement. The law is set to take effect in July.\n    \n\nOhio \u2013 Two Republican state representatives introduced a bill in the state legislature on Monday that would ban the teaching or providing of \u201cany curriculum or instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d to students in kindergarten through third grade, using similar language to the Florida law critics have named \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay.\u201d If passed, the measure would also forbid Ohio public school educators in grades four through 12 from teaching or using \u201cinstructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity in any manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d What\u2019s next:  Awaiting votes in the state House.\n    \n\nTexas \u2013 The state began investigating families seeking gender-affirming care for their transgender minor children after Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton declared such treatment to be \u201cchild abuse.\u201d Republican Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Department of Family and Protective Services to begin the investigations. The ACLU sued on behalf of the parents of a transgender girl and an appeals court has upheld a temporary injunction blocking the action. What\u2019s next: Paxton has asked the state Supreme Court to intervene to allow the child abuse investigations.\n    \n\nArizona \u2013 Ducey last month signed two bills into law targeting transgender youth in the state, prohibiting trans girls and women from competing on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports teams and restricting youth access to gender-affirming care. What\u2019s next: The ACLU has vowed to sue to block the law restricting gender-affirming care.\n    \n\nOklahoma \u2013 Stitt signed legislation banning transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at public schools, public charter schools and public colleges in the state.\n    \n\nIowa \u2013 Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation banning transgender women and girls from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges.\n    \n\nSouth Dakota \u2013 Noem signed a law banning transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges.\n    \n\n    New anti-critical race theory actions\n\n\nFlorida \u2013 The GOP-controlled state legislature has voted to ban public schools and private businesses from teaching people to \u201cfeel guilt\u201d for historical events committed by people of their race. The \u201cStop WOKE Act\u201d would also prohibit instruction that says certain races or sexes are privileged or oppressed. The bill comes after Florida banned the teaching of critical race theory last year in public schools. What\u2019s next: The bill heads to DeSantis, who is expected to sign it.\n    \n\nKentucky \u2013 The Republican-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Beshear that restricts classroom instruction about race. The law says in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: \u201cAn individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race or sex\u201d and that \u201cdefining racial disparities solely on the legacy\u201d of slavery \u201cis destructive to the unification of our nation.\u201d\n    \n\nGeorgia \u2013 The state legislature approved a bill that would limit discussions about race in classrooms and prohibit schools from advocating \u201cdivisive concepts,\u201d including discussion that people \u201cshould feel anguish, guilt, or any other form of psychological distress\u201d about their race and that \u201cthe United States of America is fundamentally racist.\u201d The bill would also allow the Georgia High School Association to ban transgender students from participating in girls\u2019 sports in public high schools. What\u2019s next: The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for signing.\n    \n\nSouth Dakota \u2013 Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order last month restricting the teaching of critical race theory in K-12 schools after the state Senate Education Committee killed a bill that would have accomplished a similar goal. Noem has also signed a law this session blocking mandatory critical race theory trainings and orientations at colleges in the state.\n    \n\nOhio \u2013 A bill introduced earlier this month mirroring the Florida law critics have dubbed \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d would also ban curriculum for all grades that teaches, promotes or endorses what it calls \u201cdivisive or inherently racist concepts.\u201d It would outlaw any textbook, instructional material or academic curriculum that \u201cpromotes\u201d concepts such as critical race theory; intersectional theory; The 1619 Project; inherited racial guilt; diversity, equity and inclusion learning outcomes; inherited racial guilt; or \u201cany other concept that the state board of education defines as divisive or inherently racist.\u201d What\u2019s next: The bill awaits a vote in the state House.\n    \n\n    New \u2018election police\u2019 forces\n\n\nFlorida \u2013 The Republican-controlled Florida House passed a voting overhaul bill that would create a security office to investigate election crimes and increase penalties for violating the state\u2019s election laws. The legislation would establish a scaled-back version of an elections police force first proposed last year by DeSantis. What\u2019s next: The bill will be sent to DeSantis\u2019 desk for a signature.\n    \n\nGeorgia \u2013 State lawmakers passed a bill on their final day of the session earlier this month that would give new election policing powers to the state\u2019s bureau of investigation. Georgia becomes the second state after Florida to pass an election police force bill this year as Republicans continue to falsely claim the 2020 election was rife with voter fraud. What\u2019s next: The bill awaits Kemp\u2019s signature. He has 40 days to sign the legislation or veto it.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
