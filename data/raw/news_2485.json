(CNS photo/Tim Swift, Catholic Review)\u00a0Pope Francis spoke out on the police killing of George Floyd last week as protests against racism spread across the globe. This week on Inside the Vatican, veteran Vatican correspondent Gerard O\u2019Connell describes the protests in Europe and the change of heart some Europeans have had about racism in their countries.Listen and subscribe on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.Pope Francis made his position on the death of George Floyd clear as he called two American bishops to thank them for speaking out against racism. One, Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, had been photographed kneeling with a Black Lives Matter sign; the other was Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. On the show, Gerry and I unpack the pope\u2019s statement that \u201cwe cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life.\u201dRELATED STORIES Pope Francis calls U.S. bishops to offer prayers amid George Floyd protestsMichael J.
