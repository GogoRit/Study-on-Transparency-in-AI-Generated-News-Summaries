concerns about a draft law currently under discussion in the National Council of the Slovak Republic which would introduce restrictions on access to safe and legal abortion services.\nThe letter was sent on 7 September to the Speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic and to the Chairpersons of the Committees on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, Health Care and Social Affairs.\nIn her letter, the Commissioner refers to two proposals in particular. Firstly, the proposal to extend the mandatory waiting period from 48 to 96 hours, and to expand its application to all situations except when a woman\u2019s health is at immediate risk. Secondly, the proposal to introduce a new authorisation requirement for performing abortions on health grounds, that would require two medical certificates attesting to such grounds, rather than one as is currently the case, except in the case of urgent care provision.\nFurthermore, she warns that other proposed changes, such as those concerning the provision of information on abortion, the collection and sharing of personal information and the proposed ban on \u2018advertising\u2019 abortion services may form substantial barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services, and stigmatise women seeking an abortion.\nThe Commissioner stresses that the proposed measures run counter to World Health Organisation guidelines, as well as specific recommendations to the Slovak Republic by international human rights bodies, including her Office. She therefore urges the members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic to reject any proposed measures that would, in law or practice, lead to retrogression as regards the access of women to their sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nRead the Commissioner's for Human Rights\u00a0letter addressed to the Parliament of the Slovak Republic\n\n\nStrasbourg\n10/09/2020\n\n\n\t\t\tDiminuer la taille du texte\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tAugmenter la taille du texte\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tImprimer la page\n\t\t\n\n\n\n2020-09-10T09:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nen-GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfran\u00e7ais-France\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439-\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmagat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho we are\n\nThe Commissioner\nPrevious Commissioners\nThe mandate\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat we do\n\nCountry work\nThematic work\nHuman Rights Defenders\n\n\n\nResources\n\nCountry Reports\nSpeeches\nIssue papers\nOpinions\nPublications\nRecommendations\nThird party interventions\n\n\n\nContacts\n\nContact us\nWho's who\n\nPress\n\nNews\nOpinion articles\nVideos\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 Council of Europe Portal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nWho we are\n\n\nHuman Rights\n\n\nDemocracy\n\n\nRule of Law\n\n\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights\n\n\nJobs and Traineeships\n\n\nVisit us\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n X (Twitter)\n\n\n Instagram\n\n\n LinkedIn\n\n\n Youtube\n\n\n Flickr\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\nPrivate office of the Secretary General\n\n\nContact for the media\n\n\nExternal offices\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nProcurement\n\n\nGrants\n\n\nPatronage\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nOversight Advisory Committee\n\n\nEthics Officer\n\n\n\n\nMultimedia\n\n\nNewsroom\n\n\nHuman Rights Channel\n\n\nPhoto galleries\n\n\nOnline bookshop\n\n\nOnline resources\n\n\nCampaigns\n\n\n\n\nUSEFUL LINKS\n\n\nArchives\n\n\nArchived web pages\n\n\nAmicale\n\n\nAdministrative Tribunal\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nAccess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Intranet\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncil of Europe,\n                \n\nAvenue de l'Europe\nF-67075\nStrasbourg Cedex, France\n -\n                \n                Tel. +33 (0)3 88 41 20 00\n\n\n\n            Disclaimer - \u00a9 Council of Europe 2024 - \u00a9 Photo credit\n        \n        -\n            \n                Contact\n            \n            -\n\n        \n            RSS\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
