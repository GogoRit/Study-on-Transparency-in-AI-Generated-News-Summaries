Here\u2019s what that could meanBy Olivia VidalUpdated: Nov. 4, 2020 at 4:49 PM CSTShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInNEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - On the election ballot, Amendment 1, also known as the \u201clove life\u201d amendment, passed in the state of Louisiana with more than 60-percent of the vote. For the first time, Louisiana voters had the opportunity to vote directly on the issue of abortion in any context. In this case, it asked voters whether they support an amendment claiming no specific wording should be found in the state constitution protecting the right to an abortion.\u201cThis is one of the constitutional amendments that even if you went in there pro-life or pro-choice, it could have [the ballot language] been confusing,\u201d Fox 8 political analyst Mike Sherman said. Meaning a vote yes would state that a voter agrees on nothing in the constitution protects a right to abortion. Where a no vote would leave the constitution with no specific language on abortion.\u201cPrior to this constitutional amendment, the Louisiana constitution was silent about abortion. Now we have explicit language saying nothing in this constitution protects the right to an abortion,\u201d Sherman said. Ben Clapper with Louisiana Right to Life says the passing of Amendment 1 was a big success even though it doesn\u2019t ban abortions today. \"What it does do is protects pro-life laws that are on the books today like \u201cinform consent\u201d ultra-sound laws that are supported by a vast majority of Louisianans, in addition to bans on taxpayer funding of abortion. This amendment protects those laws from judges who might want to usurp the power of our legislators and declare their own policy,\" Clapper said. Making sure that Louisiana lawmakers are the ones making the policy decisions on abortion and not judges. Something the New Orleans Abortion Fund disagrees with.The organization wasn\u2019t available for an on-camera interview but released this statement: \u201cThe New Orleans Abortion Fund and all other Louisianans who value our right to make decisions for our own lives, bodies and families will continue to support and respect people who have abortions. We will work to protect and expand abortion access until everyone in our community is able to receive affordable care when they need it, without fear or stigma.\u201d\u201cIf Roe V. Wade goes away, there will be state by state decisions about whether or not to allow abortions. In Louisiana, this amendment will take away the right for anyone to claim the Louisiana constitution protects the right to an abortion,\u201d Sherman said. For now, Amendment 1 is considered a symbolic move, but one that could become very important if the US Supreme Court overturns or scales back the Roe v. Wade abortion case.Copyright 2020 WVUE.
