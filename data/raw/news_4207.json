In the letter, the ACLU of New Mexico advises elected officials to consider abortion care; all forms of birth control; STI screening, testing, and treatment; vaginal health and treatment; prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care as essential reproductive services that must remain accessible at all times.\u00a0\n\u201cWe need a response plan to the COVID-19 public health emergency that protects the health, safety, and civil liberties of everyone in our community,\u201d said ACLU of New Mexico Reproductive Rights Attorney Ellie Rushforth. \u201cEven in times of crisis, it is critical that New Mexicans continue to be able to make their own reproductive health decisions and access the care they need without interruption.\u201d\u00a0\nThe letters outline\u00a0immediate steps elected officials should take to ensure uninterrupted access to reproductive care including: treating reproductive health care clinics and outpatient abortion providers as essential businesses; suspending limits on or increasing refills for prescription medications such as birth control; working with the medical community to prevent dangerous disruptions in pregnancy and postpartum care; and ensuring that healthcare facilities are immigration enforcement-free zones so that immigration status does not prevent a person from seeking medical care.\n\u201cToo many people \u2014\u00a0especially women of color, immigrants, young people, incarcerated people, LGBTQ+ folks, people with limited income, and rural New Mexicans \u2014\u00a0already face extreme barriers to reproductive healthcare,\u201d said Rushforth. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that these barriers could intensify during the public health emergency unless elected officials take immediate measures to ensure all forms of reproductive healthcare are declared essential. We\u2019ll be monitoring the government\u2019s response closely to make sure it is scientifically justified and no more intrusive on civil liberties than absolutely necessary.\u201d\nCopies of letters are available below.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n###\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Help Request\n\n\n \n\nFile a Complaint \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated IssuesReproductive Freedom\n\n\n\nDocumentspdfLetterToCongressionalDelegation_ReproAccess_COVID-19.pdf\npdfLetterToGovLujan-Grisham_ReproAccess_COVID-19.pdf\npdfLetterToMayors_ReproAccess_COVID-19.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related content    \n\n\n \nIncarcerated Person Menstrual ProductsJanuary 23, 2024\n\n \nPaid Family Medical Leave ActJanuary 17, 2024New Mexico Supreme Court Hears Critical Case on Reproductive RightsDecember 15, 2023\n\n \nDenied Reproductive Care at a Religiously Affiliated Hospital?
