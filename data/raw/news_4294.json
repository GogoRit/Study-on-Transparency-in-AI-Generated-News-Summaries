Wade\u201d Says Christian Right Paid Her to Be Anti-Choice Mouthpiece\n\nMcCorvey was paid more than $450,000 in \u201cbenevolent gifts\u201d to be an anti-abortion spokesperson.\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\nChris Walker\n\n, \n\n Truthout\n\n\n\nPublished\n\n\n\nMay 19, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNorma McCorvey, the \"Jane Roe\" of Roe v. Wade, is surrounded by young people, January 27, 2001, during an anti-abortion rally in Austin, Texas. The rally called for an end to legal abortions allowed by the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision.Joe Raedle / Newsmakers\n\nNorma McCorvey probably isn\u2019t a household name across most of the United States, but she was instrumental in a Supreme Court ruling most Americans are well-aware of: Roe v. Wade. \nIn that decision, lawyers for McCorvey, who was listed as \u201cJane Roe\u201d in briefings, successfully argued that abortion rights should be recognized across the entirety of the United States of America. Though efforts have been made over the years to limit the scope of that ruling (including during the coronavirus crisis), the right to have an abortion has remained intact ever since.\nMcCorvey\u2019s story didn\u2019t end there, however, and saw her crossing sides later in her life. In 1995 McCorvey announced she had changed her mind to the dismay of many in the pro-choice movement. \nJoining an anti-choice crusade, led by Reverend Rob Schenck and Reverent Flip Benham at the time, McCorvey renounced her support for abortion rights and said she was a born-again Christian who was pro-life. McCorvey, who was also a lesbian, said she was renouncing that part of her life, too.\nThe anti-choice activist passed away in 2017, but not before sitting down with filmmakers to tell her whole story. In AKA Jane Roe, the FX documentary that takes a deeper look at McCorvey\u2019s life, a huge revelation is made in the final 20 minutes of the film: her renunciation of the pro-choice movement was entirely fabricated.\n\nRelated Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n|\nReproductive Rights\n\n\nAnti-Abortion Groups Are Using the COVID-19 Outbreak to Stop Abortions\n\n\nThe groups suggested strategies the administration could use amid the COVID-19 crisis to cut off access to abortion.\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\nDennis Carter\n\n, \n\n Rewire.News\n\n\nMarch 26, 2020\n\n\n\n\nTruthout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is my deathbed confession,\u201d McCorvey says in the film, revealing that she didn\u2019t really change her views at all. It was \u201call an act,\u201d she said.\nAsked by filmmakers whether she was used \u201cas a trophy\u201d by anti-choice movement, McCorvey responded in the affirmative. \u201cOf course. I was the Big Fish,\u201d she said\nFilmmakers also asked McCorvey if she was using the anti-choice movement for her own benefit. \u201cI think it was a mutual thing,\u201d she explained. \u201cI took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201d\nThe two clergymen who worked with McCorvey in the 1990s took differing views on her statements. Benham maintains they did not pay McCorvey for her conversion to their side, but Schenck has said otherwise, explaining \u201cshe was actually on the payroll, as it were.\u201d \nAKA Jane Roe filmmakers uncovered $456,911 in payments called \u201cbenevolent gifts\u201d made to McCorvey.\n\nSchenck himself had a change of heart about the issue of abortion, too. In a 2018 interview, he explained that he\u2019s tempered his views significantly, arguing against movements to make the practice illegal.\n\u201cThis is not a question for politicians,\u201d Schenck said then to NPR. \u201cWhen your end goal is a political one, you will, without exception, exploit the pain and the suffering and the agony of those who face the issue in their daily reality, in their real life.\u201d\nIn a recent tweet about the documentary, Schenck expressed originally feeling \u201cconflicted\u201d about being interviewed, but said he was \u201cglad\u201d he ended up agreeing to speak in the film. \u201cYou\u2019ll see me express deep regret for how movement leaders like me treated Norma McCorvey, \u2018Jane Roe\u2019 of Roe v. Wade,\u201d he added.\nNot every voice on the pro-choice side of the argument was happy to hear McCorvey\u2019s confession in the film. Texas-based abortion rights activist Charlotte Taft who also appears in the documentary. When confronted by filmmakers about McCorvey\u2019s revelation, Taft expressed betrayal by her former friend.\n\u201cThat just really hurts because it\u2019s big stakes. It\u2019s just really big stakes,\u201d Taft said.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to stand for it. Are you?\nYou don\u2019t bury your head in the sand.
