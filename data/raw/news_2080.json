A three-hour commute proves itNews Sports Counties Business Music Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals  CONTRIBUTORSTennessee's abortion law threatened my life. I'm suing on behalf of my deceased daughter.A plaintiff in the Center for Reproductive Rights\u2019 case against Tennessee shares how she had to leave the state for an abortion to save her own life.Allyson \"Allie\" PhillipsGuest ColumnistAllyson \"Allie\" Phillips, a Tennessee mother and plaintiff in the case filed Sept. 12 against the State of Tennessee on behalf of three women who were denied abortions in dire situations.Tennessee\u2019s politicians are passing cruel laws against something they know nothing about \u2212 medically essential abortions.I needed one, and it was traumatizing for me and my family that I had to leave Tennessee to get it. Tennesseans must be able to get the care they need at home.A lifelong Tennessean, I became a single mom at age 22, working three jobs to support my daughter while earning my degree.Adalie is 6 now and like me, she\u2019s very social and a little stubborn. About the time she turned 3, I reconnected with a former high school boyfriend and we got married last year.Bryan is such a great stepfather and we both wanted to grow our family. We were ecstatic to learn we were pregnant last November. Each night, at bedtime, Adalie would lie next to me and sing \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"\u00a0while rubbing my belly.Hear more Tennessee Voices:Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.I could not legally get an abortion in TennesseeEarly on, we learned we were having a girl. We named her Miley Rose, after the song \u201cFlowers\u201d by Miley Cyrus.\u00a0At 19 weeks, I brought Adalie along with me to share in what I thought would be a routine anatomy scan. But after the scan, I saw a high-risk maternal fetal medicine specialist who explained that Miley\u2019s kidneys, bladder and stomach had not formed as expected and were not functioning.\u00a0Two of the four chambers of her heart were also not working. She had little-to-no amniotic fluid. She had stopped growing.\u00a0There were no signs of lung development. She also had a rare brain condition. We were told she had no chance at life.It was definitive.\u00a0The doctor suggested there were two options\u2013 either terminating the pregnancy, or continuing, knowing she would not survive.\u00a0Because of Tennessee\u2019s cruel ban on abortion, an essential medical procedure, I could not legally get an abortion in my home state. I would have to travel out of state, and my doctor told me that Tennessee law prevented her from offering me any resources in that effort.Sign up for Black Tennessee Voices newsletter:Read compelling columns by Black writers from across Tennessee.\u00a0Our daughter died, but the risk to me was still greatAlthough there was no way of knowing how much longer Miley Rose would survive inside my womb, the longer she was there, the more risk there was to my health and safety.\u00a0I made the decision to have an abortion.\u00a0Instead of being able to grieve for her and the future we dreamed of, I had to scramble and start calling clinics in the states that allowed second trimester abortions, book flights, find hotels and arrange transportation. And figure out how to pay for it all.Thankfully,\u00a0I found a clinic in New York City that could get me in the following week. After I arrived at the clinic, I learned that Miley Rose\u2019s heart was no longer beating.Completely broken, I had to call Bryan and tell him over the phone that our daughter was gone. But the risk to me was not over. The doctor told me that my body hadn\u2019t recognized that she had died, and that there was about a 2-week window before I would become severely at risk of blood clots and infections, including sepsis.Sign up for Latino Tennessee Voices newsletter:Read compelling stories for and with the Latino community in Tennessee.\u00a0I can honor my daughter Miley Rose through my testimonyWithin an hour, I went into surgery alone. I sat in recovery alone. I grieved the loss of my daughter alone, in a city I\u2019d never been to, around doctors I\u2019d never met before, far from my family. I am so grateful for the caring professionals who treated me with such dignity, but I should never have had to leave home for humane health care\u2013abortion care.I realized that sharing my experience publicly could be a powerful way to honor Miley Rose.\u00a0That is why I\u2019m joining the Center for Reproductive Rights\u2019 case against Tennessee; it\u2019s why I documented my heartbreaking experience on TikTok. It\u2019s why I\u2019m going to keep fighting these dangerous laws. The autonomy to make personal medical decisions about our lives and futures and health care must be returned to patients like me and our doctors.Allyson \"Allie\" Phillips, a Tennessee mother and plaintiff in the case filed Sept. 11 against the State of Tennessee on behalf of three women who were denied abortions in dire situations.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.tennessean.com.
