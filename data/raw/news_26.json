WadeThe Supreme Court will review Mississippi abortion law, which bans abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected. Here's how states handle abortion.Just the FAQs, USA TODAYNEW YORK \u2013 The\u00a0coronavirus outbreak\u00a0has fueled attempts to ban abortions in some states, but providers where the procedure remains available report increased demand, often from women distraught over economic stress and health concerns linked to the pandemic.\u201cThe calls we\u2019ve been getting are frantic,\u201d said Julie Burkhart, who manages clinics in Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen more women coming sooner than they would have because they\u2019re scared they won\u2019t be able to access the services later.\u201dSome clinics are seeing patients who traveled hundreds of miles from states such as Texas, which has banned abortions during much of the pandemic on grounds they are nonessential.Dr. Allison Cowett of Family Planning Associates in Chicago said one recent patient was a teen who drove from Texas with her mother. In Atlanta, Dr. Marissa Lapedis said her clinic accommodated a woman who received her initial abortion consultation in Texas but flew to Georgia when the Texas ban postponed a second visit to receive the abortion pill.An influx of women from Texas contributed to the upsurge of abortions at Burkhart\u2019s clinic in Wichita. She said it performed 252 abortions in March, up from 90 in March 2019.Abortions during pandemic: Texas clinics ask Supreme Court to allow certain abortions during coronavirus pandemicWorries of making rent, feeding a family, getting health careDr. Jen Villavicencio, an abortion provider in Michigan, predicts that demand for abortions will continue to increase during the pandemic.\u201cI hear it in my patient\u2019s voices and questions daily,\u201d she said by\u00a0email. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about how they will make their rent, feed their family, access a ventilator if the need arises.\u201dThe pandemic has prompted Planned Parenthood, the national\u2019s largest abortion provider, to make adjustments.In New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., Planned Parenthood has modified medication abortion procedures to minimize travel and potential COVID-19 exposure for patients and staff.Dr. Meera Shah is chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, which serves New York\u2019s northern suburbs. She says her staff is expanding telemedicine as they see an uptick in patients seeking abortions, often convinced that \u201chaving a child right now isn\u2019t best for them.\u201d\u201cWe provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWe provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.\u201dDr. Anne Davis, an OB-GYN at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said all services at her hospital are under stress, and COVID-19 patients are numerous. In most cases, her team refers women seeking abortions to non-hospital clinics.She cited one patient who had wanted to be pregnant but requested an abortion when it became clear her medical condition would require multiple hospital visits. Davis said the woman had received comparable treatment during her first pregnancy but decided this time that the hospital wouldn\u2019t be as safe.Women are more likely to go through with procedure now, one clinic reportsOne of the biggest challenges in counseling pregnant women\u00a0is uncertainty, Davis said.\u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about this to say it\u2019s going to be fine \u2013 your pregnancy will proceed in usual fashion and there will be no impact from COVID-19,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want us to say it will be all right. We have to say, \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201dAt Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois, close to Saint Louis, deputy director Alison Dreith says women are now less likely to change their minds once they schedule an abortion. Normally, 50% go through with it; amid the pandemic, the rate is 85%.Hope Clinic staff member Hannah Dismer said one couple decided to terminate a pregnancy they had planned. The wife worried that giving birth at a hospital might expose her to the coronavirus and create risk for the child they have.\u201cIt hit me really hard that she and her husband had to make that difficult decision,\u201d Dismer said.Another concern is that abortion bans will force some women into continuing with high-risk pregnancies.\u201cWithout services, very sick babies will be born and families forced to watch them suffer who would, in other times, have made a different decision,\u201d said Dr. Maryl Sackeim, a Chicago-based OB-GYN.The push for new bans has added urgency to a campaign providing information about relatively safe options for do-it-yourself abortions.Already, many abortions are induced at home with a two-drug combination, under the guidance of a health professional. Advocacy groups say home abortions using one of the drugs \u2013 misoprostol \u2013 can be done without professional oversight.Misoprostol is available only by prescription in the U.S. but is available online from some countries where it sells over the counter.Attorney Jill E. Adams, executive director of If/When/How, supports that option and urges prosecutors not to target women who use this method.\u201cMore people will need abortions during this pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cTargeting people who end their pregnancies at home is wrong as a matter of law and dangerous as a matter of public health.\u201dAmid debate about whether abortion is an essential service, anti-abortion protesters have mobilized outside numerous clinics \u2013 in some cases triggering confrontations with police over whether they\u2019re violating social-distancing rules. In North Carolina, eight of about 50 protesters were arrested April 4 after refusing to disperse outside a clinic in Charlotte.Even as many businesses close temporarily, anti-abortion pregnancy centers remain open. Virginia-based Care Net, which oversees about 1,100 centers, evoked the pandemic in a fundraising appeal, noting that unplanned pregnancies may rise during isolation, and \u201cour centers need to find creative ways to serve these parents and empower them to choose life.\u201dOverwhelmed hospitals, equipment shortages: Coronavirus pandemic plays out as state planners expectedOn the front lines: Health care workers in Ohio are testing positive for COVID-19 at an alarming rate\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
