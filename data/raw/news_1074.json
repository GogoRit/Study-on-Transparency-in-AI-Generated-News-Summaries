While a state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abortion policies affect all people seeking care, they are particularly significant for individuals who find it difficult or outright impossible to access care when forced to navigate around abortion bans and restrictions. This includes people already facing barriers due to factors like their race, income, age or gender identity.\n\n\nAbortion policies currently in effect in {{ selectedState.state }} include the following:\n\n{{ policy|trim }}\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Who May Need an Abortion\nAffordable and accessible abortion care is a right that exists only on paper for many people who are already marginalized and oppressed by structural inequities, including people with low incomes, Black and Brown communities and other people of color, young people, and those who are uninsured or are prohibited from using their insurance for abortion care. \nPlease note: Anyone who can get pregnant may need an abortion, including people who do not identify as women. We use \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen of reproductive age\u00e2\u0080\u009d when describing the potential pool of abortion patients in order to reflect the terminology of our data sources.
