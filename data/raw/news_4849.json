The following month, Weddington and Coffee filed a lawsuit against Dallas district attorney Henry Wade for enforcing Texas\u2019s abortion law and used McCorvey as their lead plaintiff. The case ended up at the United States Supreme Court, and on January 22, 1973, the justices overturned the law seven-to-two and legalized abortion in all fifty states.\nOn that day, Norma McCorvey became Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade\u2014part symbol, part person, trapped in the maelstrom of history and the sound and fury of America\u2019s abortion wars. When she left the abortion industry for the pro-life movement in 1994, she made headlines across the nation.\nNow again, McCorvey is making headlines as the bombshell subject of a new FX documentary, AKA Jane Roe, which claims that she changed her mind a second time and reverted back to a pro-abortion position. Producer Nick Sweeney tells a story in which McCorvey\u2019s relationship with the pro-life movement was strictly a financial one.\nIn a series of interviews that she dubbed her \u201cdeathbed confession,\u201d McCorvey calls it all an \u201cact.\u201d\n\u201cI was the big fish,\u201d McCorvey says in the documentary. \u201cI think it was a mutual thing \u2026 I took their money and they\u2019d put me out in front of the cameras and tell me what to say.\u201d\nNumerous headlines have suggested that McCorvey was \u201cpaid to change her mind\u201d on abortion, despite the fact that those are not actually her words. In trying to unearth the real narrative, I spoke with many of her close friends, three of whom went on the record. Those three, in addition to others, reject the idea that she was bribed into switching sides. Their story of McCorvey and their relationship with her is much more complex, intimate, and humane.\n\u201cFor this new documentary to quote Norma saying she was not genuinely pro-life is very suspicious,\u201d said Father Frank Pavone, director of Priests for Life. \u201cI knew Norma. Her pro-life convictions were not an act.\u201dArticle continues below\n\nFree NewslettersGet the best from CT editors, delivered straight to your inbox!\n\n\n\n More Newsletters\nPavone was part of McCorvey\u2019s faith story. As she described in her second memoir, Won By Love, her relationship with various pro-lifers led her to Christianity and also to the pro-life movement. On August 8, 1995, she was baptized in a backyard swimming pool in Dallas, Texas. In 1998, she became a Roman Catholic and adopted Pavone as her spiritual director. (His organization recently released a statement on the Sweeney documentary.)\nStarting the year of her baptism, McCorvey spoke at numerous pro-life events and publicly expressed remorse for her role in the legalization of abortion. In 2004, she even sought to have the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade based on new evidence that abortion hurts women. (The case was dismissed the following year.)\nWas McCorvey bribed for her ongoing contributions to the movement? Sweeney\u2019s evidence for this claim\u2014that over the decades, McCorvey had been paid at least $456,911 in gifts\u2014supports an opposite conclusion, in my opinion. The figure is not a high one, considering that some pro-life speakers often earn upwards of $10,000 for a single speaking engagement. And being paid to advocate for a position is not the same thing as being paid to change your mind.\nMore importantly, my sources suggest that these monetary contributions were primarily given not for coercive purposes but for supportive ones. McCorvey\u2019s pro-life friends cared deeply for her and often helped her financially when she was in need.\n\u201cShe\u2019d begun speaking at banquets and giving her testimony with the help of Ronda Mackey and the Operation Rescue team [a pro-life organization founded in 1986], but the travel soon became too strenuous for her, as it caused her anxiety,\u201d said Karen Garnett, one of McCorvey\u2019s close friends.\n\u201cFather Edward Robinson suggested to the board of directors of the Catholic Pro-Life Committee of North Texas, of which I was executive director, that we consider adopting Roe No More Ministry [McCorvey\u2019s project] as one of the pro-life agencies we donated to, to help Norma pay the bills to keep her office going,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIt was agreed, and a monthly donation to her ministry began and continued through the years, purely out of love and support for our dear sister and friend.\u201d\nAccording to my sources, McCorvey also lived frequently with her friends in the pro-life community when she needed a place to stay. In the early 2000s, she lived for several months with Troy Newman, one of the participants in Operation Rescue. Newman remembers her as a funny, down-to-earth friend who \u201cloved children and adored my own five children.\u201d They had many heart-to-heart conversations, one of which transpired on New Year\u2019s Eve, after he and Norma\u2014along with his family and friends\u2014had gone to a pub and grill.Article continues below\n\nOn the drive home, McCorvey grew very quiet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Norma?\u201d Newman asked her. \u201cIt\u2019s January,\u201d she replied softly.\n\u201cBoth of us knew immediately what that meant,\u201d Newman told me. It meant the anniversary of Roe v. Wade was near, and with it came a renewal of the guilt McCorvey carried with her.\nBryan Kemper, the youth outreach director of Priests for Life, remembers similar conversations with McCorvey. He recalls one in particular that happened while they were both sitting in a church parking lot smoking cigarettes. She told him about the crushing guilt that would sweep over her when she would sit across from an empty playground. She would weep and wonder if it was empty because the children that could be playing there had been killed by abortion. In response, he reminded her that grace and forgiveness could be found in God.\n\u201cShe was always such a blessing to talk to and hang out with,\u201d Kemper told me. \u201cShe was a friend, and someone who I know loved God and wanted to see an end to abortion.\u201d\nWhat about one of the most damning accusations leveled by the media in response to AKA Jane Roe\u2014that the pro-life movement \u201cused\u201d McCorvey? If that is true, several sources told me, it was \u201cnot done cynically or intentionally.\u201d Unfortunately, but perhaps inevitably, many people looked at McCorvey and saw Jane Roe the symbol rather than Norma McCorvey, a complex woman with a pain-filled past. The simple story of Jane Roe going to war with the industry she once served was both powerful and irresistible, and in their zeal to overturn Roe v. Wade and save lives from abortion, some pro-life advocates easily overlooked the fact that the real Norma McCorvey couldn\u2019t easily fill a symbolic role. But that certainly wasn\u2019t the case for everyone.\n\u201cI know she felt that there were people who used her because they saw her more as Jane Roe than as Miss Norma,\u201d Newman told me. \u201cBut to me, she was always Miss Norma. She was my friend, and I loved her. She was the Rosa Parks of the pro-life movement, and it was our responsibility to take care of her. It was our privilege to do so.\u201dArticle continues below\n\nGarnett, who shared a 22-year friendship with McCorvey that the two dubbed a \u201csisterhood,\u201d has a similar but slightly different view of this part of the story. She hadn\u2019t heard that her friend felt \u201cused\u201d by the pro-life movement until McCorvey\u2019s biographer Joshua Prager told her so.\n\u201cIn our conversation, he shared that through his hundreds of hours of time spent with Norma over the previous four years, he believed Norma felt that she had been \u2018used and exploited\u2019 by both sides of the abortion debate,\u201d said Garnett. \u201cThat was a surprise to me, because in the 22 years that I had known Norma, she had never expressed to me that she\u2019d felt used and exploited by people in the pro-life movement.\u201d\nNonetheless, Garnett wanted to respond before it was too late.\nAt the time of Prager\u2019s revelation to Garnett, McCorvey had been in and out of the hospital and was nearing death. On the morning of February 13, 2017, her daughter called Garnett to let her know that McCorvey had been admitted to ICU and intubated. They weren\u2019t sure if she would make it, so they asked Garnett to come. McCorvey was sedated through the night. The following evening, however, \u201cshe was able to talk to me for the first time after coming off the breathing machine, and she said \u2018Hi Baby\u2019 three times,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cIt was very heart-warming.\u201d\n\u201cShe was awake and alert, and as I was standing on one side of her bed, with her daughter and granddaughter standing across on the other side of her bed, I told her, and them, that I wanted to apologize to her and ask for her forgiveness for anyone in the pro-life movement who had ever hurt her or caused her to feel hurt or pain,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cI shared that publicly, as well, during the eulogy at her funeral on February 25, 2017 after she\u2019d passed on the morning of February 18th.\u201d\nWhat lesson should the pro-life community learn from all this?\nIn her apology, Garnett did something deeply Christian: She recognized McCorvey\u2019s vulnerability and asked forgiveness for any sins committed against her. This moment of apology is not depicted in the documentary, even by vague description. But from where I sit, it might be the most important moment to ponder. As a pro-life advocate, I\u2019m left asking: How can we as a movement continue to soul-search ourselves and our collective actions?Article continues below\n\nAs Matthew Lee Anderson writes, our movement is \u201canimated by the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d In this context, \u201cthe truth of compassion provides comfort in the face of the cross\u2014a comfort that defeats death not by inflicting it, but by overcoming it with love.\u201d\nIn the midst of our movement\u2019s failures and successes, we, like Garnett, are invited to be Christ\u2019s voice of love to the vulnerable. We share a high calling\u2014to admit our failures, eschew vice and deception, embrace virtue, and embody Christian ethics as we seek to protect the unborn and those who carry them. The people we serve include the McCorveys of the world, and protecting their humanity is part of that high calling. In so doing, we model the sanctity of life from \u201cwomb to tomb,\u201d as the saying goes.\nMcCorvey\u2019s closest friends, many of them Christians, did that for her in her dying hours.\nAt the end, McCorvey\u2019s deathbed conversations were not with Nick Sweeney. They were spent with Father Pavone, who spoke with her the day she died, Garnett (by phone), and several others.\nIn the final hours, Garnett told me, McCorvey\u2019s family asked her to share some music. She sent the prayer songs that she had been listening to during the time that she'd spent with McCorvey in the hospital and in hospice. One of those songs was \u201cThe Lord Is My Shepherd.\u201d The family played that songs for McCorvey, resting the phone on her chest.\nAt the last, regardless of how conflicted McCorvey may have felt about abortion or the actions of herself and others, she died loved and surrounded by those who saw her not as Jane Roe, but as their precious friend: Norma McCorvey.\nJonathon Van Maren is a public speaker, writer, and pro-life activist.
