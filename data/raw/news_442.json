Barrett has a long record of hostility to reproductive health and rights. Her writings, speeches, and rulings all add up to another vote to restrict abortion rights if she is confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n2.) If Roe v. Wade is overturned, individual states will decide whether abortion is legal. Ten states in the South, Midwest, and Mountain West regions could ban abortion through \u201ctrigger laws\u201d \u2014 designed to automatically make abortion illegal if Roe v. Wade falls. And right now, 17 abortion-related cases are one step from the Supreme Court \u2014\u00a0most involve restrictions that effectively ban abortion, without the need to overturn Roe v. Wade directly.\u00a0\n3.) 20 states have a combination of \u201ctrigger laws,\u201d \u201cpre-Roe bans,\u201d and/or legislatures hostile to reproductive health care. The politicians in power in these \u201chostile\u201d states oppose abortion and have an established history of passing extreme abortion restrictions \u2014\u00a0including six-week abortion bans that strip access before many people even know they\u2019re pregnant.\n\n\nExisting Abortion Restrictions Hurt People With Low Incomes the Most\u00a0\nFor many people, Roe v. Wade is ALREADY meaningless. In the past decade, states have passed hundreds of abortion restrictions that make safe, legal abortion out of reach for people who can\u2019t overcome unfair and costly barriers \u2014 such as long distance travel to get to the closest abortion provider, or taking time off work because of medically unnecessary two-trip requirements. The restrictions harm people with low incomes and Black and Brown people, and all women who are forced to navigate racist and discriminatory systems.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the Senate confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year, 12 states passed 25 abortion bans. Although all of these laws are blocked by lower courts, some are making their way up through the appeals process.\n\n\nSince 2011, states have passed more than 480 abortion restrictions \u2014 such as mandatory waiting periods, two-trip requirements, bans on insurance coverage, and telehealth abortion bans. These restrictions make it more difficult, and often or impossible, for people with low incomes and communities of color to access the care they need.\n\n\nNow, five states in the U.S. have only one abortion provider left: Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Action for Justice: Email Your Senators!\n\nPresident Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want to install Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court before the November election. Tell your senators to say \u201cNO\u201d to a vote \u2014 or even a hearing \u2014 on any nominee before Inauguration Day.\n\n\nTell Them Now\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nSCOTUS,\nMitch McConnell,\nPresident Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\u00a0\n\n\n\n Abortion Birth Control Health Care Planned Parenthood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Abortion Still Legal in My State?\n\nLearn about abortion access changes in your state.\n\n\nGet the Facts\n\n\n\n\n\nTell Our Courts: Save Mifepristone!\n\nWe should be able to trust our courts to respect science and follow the law.\u00a0It's time for our leaders to hear us, loud and clear: The attack on mifepristone is a gross injustice that could harm millions of people.\n\n\nSpeak Out Now\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund Will NEVER Back Down\n\nKnow this: our right to abortion is not debatable.\u00a0We will rebuild and reclaim the freedom that is ours.\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for Email\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore more on\n\nAbortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund works to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSITEMAP\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nPressroom\n\n\nTipsheet\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nElections\n\n\n\n\nIssues\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nAbortion Access\n\n\nAttacks on Planned Parenthood\n\n\nBirth Control\n\n\nFederal Courts\n\n\nHealth Equity\n\n\nSexual Assault\n\n\nSex Education\n\n\nState Attacks\n\n\nVoting Rights\n\n\n\n\nCommunities\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nLatinos for Planned Parenthood\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Black Community\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Generation Action\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nBans Off Our Bodies\n\n\nTake Action\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nGet Involved Locally\n\n\nStore\n\n\nCongressional Scorecard\n\n\nRecess Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
