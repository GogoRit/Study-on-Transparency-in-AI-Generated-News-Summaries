Similar legislation has been introduced in states across the country, and is referred to as a Reason Ban, meaning the legislation judges the reason someone seeks safe, legal abortion, without credence for individual circumstances.\nBelow is a statement from Kristin Hayward, Manager of Advocacy in South Dakota for Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota Action Fund:\n\u201cThis bill would ban some early abortions in South Dakota based on the results of prenatal genetic testing. \u00a0When faced with a prenatal diagnosis, it\u2019s crucial that everyone receives education to help make the best-informed decision for their family. \u00a0Bills like this, however, are not about educating women; they are about imposing a decision that may be right for one family on all families.\nAbortion is a deeply personal and sometimes complex decision that patients must be allowed to make in consultation with their family, faith, and health care provider. Regardless of how one personally feels about abortion, it\u2019s important that the medical procedure remain safe and legal for South Dakotans, so they can consider if and when they may need this option.\nGovernor Noem has and will try anything to eliminate access to abortion in South Dakota and this inflammatory bill makes that crystal clear. This is just one more unconstitutional abortion ban that interferes in the patient-doctor relationship.\u201d\n\u00a0\n###\nFounded in 1992, the Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit organization.
