It also risks empowering those who wish to roll back the advances in LGBTIQ+ equality and reproductive laws relating to IVF enacted by previous administrations.\u201d\u00a0\nDoctors\u00a0For\u00a0Choice said the money to the Life Network Foundation, which runs the shelter, was peddling incorrect medical claims.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is a shame that Malta\u2019s government has decided to\u00a0give a considerable sum of money\u00a0to Life Network Foundation to run its services over the next three years. This means public money is being used to fund an agenda that is based on conservative religious beliefs rather than evidence-based medicine, and this strategy is harmful to the health of women in Malta,\u201d Doctors\u00a0For\u00a0Choice said.\u00a0\n\u201cA quick look at the website of Life Line Malta, a support helpline for women in pregnancy crisis run by Life Network Foundation, reveals a number of medical untruths that are framed in a way to promote the organisation\u2019s anti-abortion and anti-contraception agenda.\u201d\u00a0\nDoctors\u00a0For\u00a0Choice said the website claimed that morning-after pills could be used to end \u2018early pregnancy\u2019. The doctors said\u00a0this was\u00a0untrue and that\u00a0no reputable scientific evidence supported\u00a0such a claim.\u00a0\u201cThe morning-after pills do not cause abortion if there already is a pregnancy ongoing. The abortion pills are completely different medicines.\u201d\u00a0\nAnother claim made\u00a0on the same website was that abortion pill\u00a0Mifepristone\u00a0\u201ccan be reversed in some cases\u201d.\u00a0Doctors\u00a0For\u00a0Choice said\u00a0there was no treatment proven to reverse the effects of Mifepristone. \u201cA\u00a0trial to look into whether giving Progesterone after Mifepristone could continue the pregnancy\u00a0had to be stopped\u00a0after women developed haemorrhages. Not only is\u00a0\u2018abortion pill reversal\u2019 treatment unproven, it is probably dangerous,\u201d the doctors said.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Vella, a freelance journalist at MaltaToday, was formerly executive editor at Malt... \n\n More from Matthew Vella\n Matthew on Twitter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise \nContact \nDigital Edition\nSMS Alerts\n\n\nTerms and Conditions \nPrivacy Policy \nCookie Policy \nArchives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaToday is an independent media house based in Malta.
