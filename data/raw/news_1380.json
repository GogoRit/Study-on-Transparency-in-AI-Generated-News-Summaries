Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposes a nationwide ban that would allow rare exceptions. The legislation has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-controlled Congress. GOP leaders did not immediately embrace it and Democrats are pointing to the proposal as an alarming signal of where Republicans would try to go if they were to win control of the Congress in November.\nMany in the United States had believed the constitutional right to abortion, established by the Supreme Court almost 50 years ago, could never be overturned. But that protection was stripped away this year by the court\u2019s conservative majority, and advocates are leaving nothing to chance.\nA majority of those questioned in a July poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research said Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.\nVice President Kamala Harris urged Democratic attorneys general at a meeting Thursday in Milwaukee to keep fighting for abortion rights in the states. She singled out Wisconsin\u2019s Josh Kaul, who is up for reelection in November, for filing a lawsuit to challenge the state\u2019s 1849 law banning abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\u201cJosh, our administration has your back,\u201d she said to applause.\nClinics in Wisconsin stopped performing abortions after the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade as the legal fight plays out over whether the state law is in effect. Republican lawmakers have rejected two attempts by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, also on the ballot, to repeal the law.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a nonprofit organization representing more than 60,000 physicians nationwide, sent a letter to the White House on Thursday outlining its concerns about the proposed law.\nREAD MORE: After Roe\u2019s demise, Democrats hit Republicans who profess to back abortion-rights\nThe group took issue with the \u201carbitrary gestational age limit\u201d because it was \u201cnot grounded in science and medical evidence and would dramatically interfere with the ability of patients to receive timely medical care, including prenatal care, miscarriage management, and abortion care.\u201d\nThe organization argued that doctors would become less skilled because if the bans were in effect, their training would be altered to comply with law. The letter said doctors feared the bans already in place in several states following the overturning of abortion rights will \u201chave deadly consequences, further exacerbating the worsening maternal mortality crisis, within which 80 percent of deaths are preventable.\u201d\nThe White House said the Republican proposal could have a chilling effect, with the prospect of doctors unwilling to care for patients any more. Doctors could also face criminal charges for performing an abortion to safeguard the health of the mother, offering miscarriage care, providing an abortion to a pregnant woman whose baby has no chance of survival, or treating a rape victim who has not fully completed reporting requirements.\nAssociated Press Writer Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-KY) unveils a nationwide abortion bill with new restrictions during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. on Sept. 13, 2022.
