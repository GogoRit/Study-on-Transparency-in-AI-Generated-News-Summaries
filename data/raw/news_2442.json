It\u2019s a somewhat similar configuration setup as the OnePlus 8, so we should be seeing similar battery life between these two phones.\nWe\u2019ve had quite a range of differently configured Snapdragon 865 devices in the last few months, with most notable difference in-between them being their displays as well as slightly varying battery capacities. Xiaomi opting for a simple 1080p 90Hz display means we\u2019re likely to see excellent battery life figures out of the phone.\n\nIn our web-browsing test, indeed the Mi 10 Pro virtually matches the OnePlus 8 as we had expected. No big surprises here, and the results are overall just excellent. Some of the competitors last longer, but that\u2019s only due to either 60Hz displays or bigger batteries.\n\nIn PCMark, for some odd reason, the Mi 10 Pro fares even better than the rest of the competition, quite ahead of the OnePlus 8. These are again some outstandingly good results for the phone even though it\u2019s in 90Hz mode.\nThe Mi 10 Pro represents a stark contrast to last year\u2019s Mi9 when it comes to battery life. The phone\u2019s much bigger battery allows it to compete with the best smartphones in the market and achieves excellent battery life. The company\u2019s choice of opting for a more regular configured display pays off in terms of power efficiency. It\u2019s to be noted that the regular Mi 10 offers a slightly bigger battery than the Pro variant, so I expect results there to be even slightly better than showcased here.\nEditorial note: I\u2019ll be adding 60Hz results of the battery tests later after publishing.\n\n\nDisplay Measurement\nCamera - Recap\n\nIntroduction & Design\nSystem Performance\nGPU Performance\nDisplay Measurement\nBattery Life - Great\nCamera - Recap\nConclusion & End Remarks\n\n\n\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Your Comment\n\n                    \n                        Please log in or sign up to comment. \n                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments Locked\n44 Comments\nView All Comments\n\n\nXex360 - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nNothing solid about a phone with a bunch of dead pixels and headphone jack.\n\n\n\nPeterCollier - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nNow I'm curious, do phones generally come with a no dead pixel guarantee? I know some high end monitors do. And the low end ones, the manufacturer might say that a few dead pixels are fine. \n\n\n\nSamus - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nI\u2019ve setup thousands of iPhones over the last decade and never seen a dead pixel in an original or OEM replacement screen. That\u2019s part of the Apple tax though, and where form over function might actually make sense in this particular case.\n\n\n\nArsenica - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nI think you mean a phone with no headphone jack.But at this price point and feature set I would rather buy a Galaxy S20+ and not worry about Chinese spyware (Korean spyware is way cooler).\n\n\n\nsonny73n - Friday, July 24, 2020 - link\nLet say you said something you shouldn\u2019t have on a phone, would you rather have that record be kept on a Chinese server or on a US server?I\u2019m sure that since you used a device that have a microphone or a webcam, you have made stupid mistakes at least once or twice. But luckily for you, you\u2019re a nobody. Your government wouldn\u2019t waste money and human resources to come after a brainwashed nobody such as you. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook. You know damn well everything you do on or around a smart device is being recorded and kept forever. But here you are, spreading the BS and hate on the Chinese. Didn\u2019t you know that your government spy on you much more than the Chinese ever can?\n\n\n\nFulljack - Friday, July 24, 2020 - link\nor just unlock the bootloader and install open-source custom rom so it'll be free of spyware. if shit happens at least Xiaomi still honor your warranty even if you tampered the software.\n\n\n\n1_rick - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nWhat dead pixels?  Or are you talking about the hole-punch selfie cam?\n\n\n\niphonebestgamephone - Friday, July 24, 2020 - link\nSo the phones with thicker bezels had much larger areas of dead pixels or what?\n\n\n\nnagi603 - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nReal shame how the price has skyrocketed between generations... I got a Mi 9 (128) for \u20ac400 w/ tax about a year ago. Of course they stopped producing it and you can't get it any longer.\n\n\n\nads295 - Thursday, July 23, 2020 - link\nA flagship is one of the few avenues they have to make money. Xiaomi has openly admitted that they have a policy to make not more than 5% margin on their devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n\u25b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIPELINE STORIES\n\n+ Submit News\n\n\n\nSK Hynix Starts Mass Production of HBM3E: 9.2 GT/s\n\n\nNVIDIA's 'cuLitho' Computational Lithography Adopted By TSMC and Synopsys For Production Use\nStarTech Unveils 15-in-1 Thunderbolt 4/USB4 Dock with Quad Display Support\n\nQualcomm Announces Snapdragon 8s Gen 3: A Cheaper Chip For Premium Phones\nBIOSTAR Debuts Barebones A620MS mATX Motherboard For Ryzen 7000 Processors\nFirst DNA Data Storage Specification Released: First Step Towards Commercialization\nAsus Launches Low-Profile GeForce RTX 3050 6GB: A Tiny Graphics Card for All PCs\nAsus Adds Support for 64GB Memory Modules to Intel 600/700 Motherboards\nWestern Digital Launches PC SN5000S SSD: Low-Cost Meets High Performance\nNETGEAR Introduces WBE750: First Insight-Manageable Wi-Fi 7 Access Point Targets Congested Deployments\nCorsair Launches New XH405i Custom Water Cooling Kits And XG7 RTX 4080-Compatible Water Blocks\nASML Delivers First 2nm-Generation Low-NA EUV Tool, the Twinscan NXE:3800E\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nForums\nRSS\nPipeline News\nBench\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nCPUs\nMotherboards\nSSD/HDD\nGPUs\nMobile\nEnterprise & IT\nSmartphones \nMemory\nCases/Cooling/PSU(s) \n\n\n\n\nDisplays \nMac \nSystems \nCloud \nTrade Shows \nGuides\n\n\n\nFOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
