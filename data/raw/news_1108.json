Wade, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that if Republicans take back control of Congress in November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s midterm elections, they will attempt to enact a nationwide ban on abortion.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nIn the aftermath of the\u00a0Supreme Court overturning\u00a0Roe v. Wade, House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy that Republicans will put forward anti-abortion legislation should they retake control of Congress\n\nMcCarthy hailed Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision as \"the most important pro-life ruling in American history\"\n\nMcCarthy specifically told CNN that he would back a 15-week nationwide abortion ban: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d support that\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence also called for a nationwide ban on abortion, telling far-right outlet Breitbart that \"we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the Congress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be aware of this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republicans are plotting a nationwide abortion ban,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pelosi said in the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their goal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis cruel ruling is outrageous and heart-wrenching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the California Democrat added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut make no mistake: the rights of women and all Americans are on the ballot this November. Reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn a press conference later in the day, House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., seemed to suggest that Republicans would put forward anti-abortion legislation should they win back the majority, pledging that the GOP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-abortion work is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfar from done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMcCarthy hailed Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most important pro-life ruling in American history\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe court affirmed that the power to protect unborn life has returned to the people and their elected representatives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\"The people have won a victory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe right to life has been vindicated. The voiceless will finally have a voice. This great nation can now live up to its core principle, that all are created equal, not born equal, created equal.\"\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs encouraging as today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision is, our work is far from done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy said.\u00a0\nWhen asked what abortion bills he would consider should Republicans win back the House majority, McCarthy said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst and foremost, I believe in saving every life possible\u00e2\u0080\u009d before slamming Democrats for their opposition to the Hyde Amendment, a provision which bars use of federal funds to pay for abortions, except for those that would save the life of the woman or in cases of rape or incest.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will continue to look wherever we can go to save as many lives as possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the California Republican added.\nMcCarthy specifically told CNN that he would back a 15-week nationwide abortion ban: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d support that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn less than 140 days things are gonna change here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McCarthy said, referring to November\u00e2\u0080\u0099s midterm elections.\nMcCarthy was not the only Republican to call for a nationwide anti-abortion legislation in the aftermath of Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling. Former Vice President Mike Pence, once a member of the House GOP caucus himself, told far-right media outlet Breitbart that \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must not rest\u00e2\u0080\u009d until abortion is outlawed across the country.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow that Roe v. Wade has been consigned to the ash heap of history, a new arena in the cause of life has emerged, and it is incumbent on all who cherish the sanctity of life to resolve that we will take the defense of the unborn and the support for women in crisis pregnancy centers to every state in America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the outlet.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pence added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            CERTIFICATIONS\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
