More husbands could mean more work \u2013 especially since globally, women do two-and-a-half times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men.\nBut China\u2019s gender imbalance is a serious problem. The country has 30 to 40 million \u201cmissing women,\u201d a situation caused by gender inequality and a preference for boys and exacerbated by the \u201cone-child policy\u201d in place from 1979 to 2015 and ongoing restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive rights. This gender gap has made it difficult for many Chinese men to find wives.\nIt has also fueled a demand for trafficked women from abroad. Human Rights Watch documented bride trafficking in Myanmar, where each year hundreds of women and girls are deceived through false promises of employment into traveling to China, only to be sold to Chinese families as brides for about US$3,000 to $13,000 and held in sexual slavery, often for years. Most were pressured to become pregnant as quickly as possible; some were compelled to undergo forced fertility treatment. Those who had children and were lucky enough to escape could usually only do so by leaving their children behind. Several of the women we interviewed had been trafficked more than once. This type of bride trafficking to China has spread across Asia, with cases documented in at least eight countries.\nFortunately, there are real solutions to China\u2019s gender imbalance that could both work and respect rights. Try combating deeply entrenched state and societal discrimination against women. Try ending government harassment of women\u2019s rights activists and government censorship of their calls for gender equality. Try equality in the workplace, including equal parental leave for women and men and an expectation that both take it. And try remembering that women are in charge of their own bodies.\nChinese netizens furiously pushed back against the polyandry proposal, suggesting they want serious change. If only the Chinese government would listen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAsia China and Tibet \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 20, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nThinking Beyond Punishment to Combat Digital Sex Crimes in South Korea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\n#MeToo in the land of censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cSchools are Failing Boys Too\u201d\n\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s Impact on Boys\u2019 Education in Afghanistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cThey Don\u2019t Treat Us like Human Beings\u201d \n\n\nAbuse of Imprisoned Women in Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 20, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nThinking Beyond Punishment to Combat Digital Sex Crimes in South Korea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\n#MeToo in the land of censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
