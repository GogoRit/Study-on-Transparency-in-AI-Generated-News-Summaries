Esther Helton-Haynes, R-East Ridge, is sponsoring House Bill 883, which will be designed to clear up confusion and enable doctors to make decisions without the threat of prosecution. Doctors can be charged with a felony for performing an abortion under the \u201ctrigger\u201d law that took effect last August after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and sent abortion decisions back to states.\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s affirmative defense, and there needs to be an exception for the life of the mother,\u201d Helton-Haynes told the Tennessee Lookout. \u201cI believe moms matter. Oftentimes they have babies at home, other children at home that need them, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m carrying the bill.\u201d\nThe measure could pit Helton-Haynes against Tennessee Right to Life, which was waiting Monday morning to see the legislation\u2019s language.

Republican Sen. Richard Briggs of Knoxville is sponsoring the Senate version.\nThe Tennessee Medical Association is making HB883 its first initiative for the legislation session. The measure clarifies exceptions to criminal abortion when the life or health of the mother are in danger, including for common procedures such as ectopic pregnancies as well as ending a pregnancy in which a \u201cnon-survivable fetal anomaly is diagnosed,\u201d in addition to providing immunity for pharmacists who dispense drugs for inducing abortions, according to a memo from the association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now it\u2019s affirmative defense, and there needs to be an exception for the life of the mother. . .
