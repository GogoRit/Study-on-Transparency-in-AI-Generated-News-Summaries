Subscribe to our daily newsletter for election context and analysis.\nControl of the Senate is still up for grabs, with races in Arizona and Nevada too close to call and Georgia headed to a runoff.\nIf Republicans take control of the chamber, they could put national abortion bans to a vote. Legislation has already been introduced, including a\u00a0ban\u00a0on the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and\u00a0a bill\u00a0from Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul that would define the right to life as starting at fertilization. But with most legislative changes currently requiring 60 votes in the Senate, plus a Democrat in the White House, it\u2019s unlikely a Republican-controlled Congress could immediately change federal abortion laws. President Joe Biden has vowed to veto any bills restricting access to the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Republicans take back the White House in two years, though, those bills would have a real chance of becoming law, especially if they agree to change the rules around the filibuster to nuke the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold. Some aspiring 2024 candidates, notably former Vice President Mike Pence, have already begun campaigning on a national abortion ban.\nPolling shows that abortion rights are\u00a0motivating more voters\u00a0than ever and that in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned, most Americans\u00a0oppose federal limitations\u00a0on the procedure. Individual Republican candidates for Congress have been hesitant to discuss their stances on abortion, with some\u00a0even eliminating references\u00a0to abortion bans from their campaign materials.\nOf the 13 Republicans identified by The 19th as being in competitive races, six have won and four have lost. Some of these candidates have said they believe abortion law should be left entirely up to the states. Others have endorsed a national abortion ban. And, while it\u2019s contradictory to say it should be left to the states and that the federal government should pass a ban, some candidates have indeed argued for both.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        Election 2022 results: Senate races we\u2019re watching\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th reached out to all 13 candidates to see where they stand on these issues. The only response came from a spokesperson for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a cosponsor of Graham\u2019s bill. Here\u2019s what each candidate has said, and how they\u2019ve voted on the issue in the past, and the status of the race, according to projections from Decision Desk HQ.\nDon Bolduc, New Hampshire (lost)\n(Scott Eisen/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortions: No\nBolduc told Fox News in September that he would not support Graham\u2019s bill. \u201cThe Supreme Court has already decided that this is a state issue. \u2026 Women on both sides of the issue will get a better voice at the state level,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nPrior to the state\u2019s Republican primary, the retired Army brigadier general maintained that position but did not directly answer whether he would like to see a federal ban.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to protect life from the beginning to the end. That\u2019s what our health care system is all about and that\u2019s what I think we should be about,\u201d Bolduc said in a debate involving candidates in the state\u2019s Republican primary.\u00a0\nTed Budd, North Carolina (won)\n(Allison Joyce/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: Yes\u00a0\nBudd said abortion should be returned to the people, but supports additional federal restrictions.\nBudd, currently in the U.S. House, is an original cosponsor of the House version of Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s Life at Conception Act, which would ban abortion after \u201cthe moment of fertilization,\u201d and the House version of Graham\u2019s bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks with exceptions for rape and incest.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling correctly empowers the people\u2019s representatives in each state to decide how best to protect unborn lives,\u201d Budd said in a statement following the Dobbs decision. \u201cAs a conscience-driven pro-life advocate, I will continue to support protections for unborn children everywhere.\u201d\u00a0\nChuck Grassley, Iowa (incumbent, won)\n(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: Yes, pre-Dobbs\nSince the Dobbs decision, Grassley has said abortion should be left to the states and \u201celected representatives,\u201d though he has declined to specify whether that means state or federal officials. In a recent campaign debate, he said he would not support a 15-week ban, but in the past, he has voted in favor of federal abortion restrictions, including a 2020 bill banning abortion at 20 weeks.\nRon Johnson, Wisconsin (incumbent, won)\n(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: No\nOn the campaign trail in August, Johnson said the decision of abortion access should be left to the people, state by state.\n\u201cI look forward to every state, the people in every state, hopefully having a serious, compassionate and sympathetic discussion to decide this question, and this is what needs to be decided. At what point does society have the responsibility to protect life?\u201d Johnson said.\nHowever, his spokesperson Alexa Henning, speaking to the Wisconsin State Journal, did not directly answer the question of whether he\u2019d oppose Graham\u2019s proposed ban.\n\u201cAs the senator has said many times, he believes this is a profound moral issue and agrees with the Dobbs decision to allow the democratic process to unfold in each state to determine at what point does society have the responsibility to protect life,\u201d Henning said.\u00a0\nAdam Laxalt, Nevada (too close to call)\n(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: Yes\u00a0Backed federal legislation restricting abortion: No\u00a0\u00a0\nLaxalt has called the Roe v. Wade decision \u201ca joke\u201d and praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn it as \u201ca historic victory for the sanctity of life.\u201d But he\u2019s emphasized that abortion is legally protected in Nevada and has repeatedly denied that he supports any federal restrictions.\n\u201cMy opponent has manufactured a litany of absurdities, falsely claiming that I am in favor of a national abortion ban,\u201d Laxalt wrote in an op-ed in the Reno Gazette-Journal. \u201cThat would of course contradict what I have argued for my entire adult life and what the Supreme Court just ordered \u2014 to return the issue to the people.\u201d\nMike Lee, Utah (incumbent, won)\n(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: Yes, \u201cmost of the time\u201dBacked federal abortion legislation restricting abortion: Yes, pre-Dobbs\nAfter the Dobbs decision, Lee put out a statement saying that \u201cmost of the time,\u201d abortion law should be decided at the state and local level, but added that \u201cin some cases, it might be federal.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what precisely that means. This year, Lee declined to endorse a 15-week abortion ban. Per his campaign site, he favors a national 20-week ban on abortion, which he has voted for in the past.\nBlake Masters, Arizona (lost)\n(John Moore/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: NoBacked federal legislation restricting abortions: Yes\nFollowing the leaked draft of the Dobbs decision, Masters said that leaving abortion to the states did not go far enough. Previously known for his hardline anti-abortion stance, he scrubbed his website of that language and softened his views following the August primary race in Arizona. In an ad posted to Twitter, he referred to his stance as \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and added he would support an abortion ban with restrictions.\u00a0\nBut when Graham announced his proposed federal abortion ban, Masters said he would \u201cof course,\u201d support it and that he hoped it would pass.\u00a0\nJoe O\u2019Dea, Colorado (lost)\n(Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: Yes, but would support establishing federal abortion protections up to a certain point in pregnancyBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: No.\nO\u2019Dea is a rare Republican on the ballot in 2022 who largely supports abortion rights. He opposes the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade and supports allowing abortion up until 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions after that for rape, incest and the patient\u2019s life.\u00a0\nIn 2020, he advocated and voted for an unsuccessful ballot measure in Colorado that would have banned abortion after 22 weeks. O\u2019Dea has said he would support codifying abortion rights \u201cearly in the pregnancy\u201d and opposes Graham\u2019s proposed 15-week ban.\n\u201cLook, I think the first five months are critical. That should be a woman\u2019s decision with her doctor,\u201d O\u2019Dea told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd after that, exceptions: rape, incest, medical necessity, those should be, again, between a woman and her doctor. And I\u2019m going to vote that way.\u201d\u00a0\nMehmet Oz, Pennsylvania (lost)\n(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: No\n\u201cThere should not be involvement from the federal government in how states decide their abortion decisions,\u201d Oz said in an October 25 debate against Democratic opponent John Fetterman.\n\u201cAs a physician, I\u2019ve been in the room when there\u2019s some difficult conversations happening \u2014\u00a0I don\u2019t want the federal government involved with that at all,\u201d Oz added. \u201cI want women, doctors, local political leaders, letting the democracy that\u2019s always allowed our nation to thrive to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves.\u201d\nMarco Rubio, Florida (incumbent, won)\n(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: NoBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: Yes\nThe day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Rubio said on Twitter that the decision \u201cdidn\u2019t end abortion rights, it only returned the debate over how to regulate it to elected state legislators.\u201d Three months later, he was one of the few senators to co-sponsor Graham\u2019s bill for a 15-week national abortion ban. Rubio has also said he opposes exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape and incest.\nTiffany Smiley, Washington (lost)\n(David Ryder/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortions: No\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life, but I oppose a federal abortion ban,\u201d Smiley said in a campaign ad.\u00a0\nSmiley and her campaign spokesperson have repeatedly taken this position, adding that the decision should be left up to the states.\u00a0\nJ.D. Vance, Ohio (won)\n(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal limit restricting abortion: Yes\nIn a Fox News town hall with Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan just before the midterms, Vance said that \u201c90 percent\u201d of abortion decisions should be left to states, and referred to Graham\u2019s bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks, saying it \u201cprovides reasonable exceptions but it also sets a minimum national standard and I think that that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Vance has also said he opposes exceptions to abortion bas in cases of rape and incest.\nHerschel Walker, Georgia (runoff)\n(Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)\nSaid abortion should be left to the states: YesBacked federal legislation restricting abortion: Yes, but later denied\nWalker said multiple times that he would support a federal ban. In July, he stated that it is a problem that there is not one already in place. Then in September, said he would back Graham\u2019s bill.\n\u201cI am a proud pro-life Christian, and I will always stand up for our unborn children. I believe the issue should be decided at the state level, but I WOULD support this policy,\u201d Walker said then.\nBut last month, Walker denied his support of a federal abortion ban during a debate with Democratic opponent Raphael Warnock, saying that his position was misconstrued.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExplore more stories about the midterms and their impact\nFrom abortion ballot measures to voting and races at the state and federal levels, find out what our reporters have learned about Election 2022.\n\n\n\n                Read the Latest\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Supreme Court leak immediately reverberated in U.S. Senate races\n\n\n\n\nWhy so many abortion restrictions are working their way through state legislatures now\n\n\n\n\nAbortion bans are unpopular.
