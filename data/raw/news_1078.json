Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, have filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law in its entirety, arguing it\u2019s out-of-date and unenforceable.Both Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Family Action are calling on lawmakers to pass a so-called personhood amendment to ban abortion in the state constitution.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother anti-abortion group, Wisconsin Right to Life, argues the focus in a post-Roe world should be on defending Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 ban and funding pregnancy resource centers.None of the groups want to add new exceptions to the law for victims of rape or incest, a step favored by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester.Here\u2019s a rundown of some issues anti-abortion groups plan to push in Wisconsin.Removing, changing exception for life of a motherWisconsin\u2019s long-dormant abortion ban, which dates back to 1849, makes performing an abortion a felony, but with a notable exception. Abortions are permitted under the law when deemed \u201cnecessary, or is advised by 2 other physicians as necessary, to save the life of the mother.\u201dIt\u2019s that language that Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Family Action want to change.\u201cThe only thing that we\u2019re concerned about \u2014 and it is a big concern \u2014 is there is a broad and undefined \u2018life of the mother\u2019 exception that we would like to eliminate,\u201d said Pro-Life Wisconsin executive director Matt Sande. \u201cWe would like to replace it with language requiring equal care for mother and child.\u201dWisconsin Family Action president Julaine Appling said ideally, her group would like the current \u201clife of the mother\u201d exception eliminated.\u201cIn a perfect world, we are not a group that thinks that exceptions are necessary or good,\u201d Appling said. \u201cWe think at a minimum it has to be more clearly defined.\u201dWisconsin Right to Life legislative director Gracie Skogman said her organization opposes removing the exception and thinks it\u2019s important to have medical emergency language in the law.\u201cSo that it is crystal clear that if there is a mother who is facing a medical emergency that she is able to get the care that she needs,\u201d Skogman said.Mike Murray, the vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, called it \u201ccallous and disheartening\u201d to call for the removal of the \u201clife of the mother\u201d exception.\u201cFor there to not even be an exception to ensure that physicians and other health care professionals can tend to the health and safety and well-being of their patients is unconscionable,\u201d Murray said.READ MORE: Are abortions ever medically necessary? Wisconsin doctors say yes.\u2018Personhood\u2019 amendment to state constitutionBoth Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Family Action also support amending the Wisconsin Constitution to ban abortions through a so-called personhood amendment that would give the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to a \u201chuman being at any stage of development.\u201dSande said his concern is that if conservatives lose the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court election, liberal justices would gain a majority on the court and could rule against abortion laws.\u201cIf we lose that in 2023, we believe that a \u2018left\u2019 Supreme Court will work to find a substantive due process right to abortion,\u201d Sande said.Appling\u2019s group also supports the plan.\u201cWe need to get to the point where we recognize the personhood of everyone from the moment of conception,\u201d Appling said.Wisconsin Right to Life\u2019s Skogman said her group\u2019s focus is elsewhere.\u201cWe do not think that that is the best or most effective way to save lives here in Wisconsin,\u201d Skogman said.GOP lawmakers last pushed such an amendment in 2020, though the plan never received a vote in the full Legislature. It would need to pass two consecutive sessions of the Legislature and be approved by voters in a statewide election in order to take effect.Murray thinks the proposal would be overwhelmingly opposed by the people of Wisconsin.\u201cI think that proposal is an even more extreme version of Wisconsin\u2019s criminal abortion ban,\u201d Murray said.Crisis pregnancy centersSkogman said Wisconsin Right to Life\u2019s focus is on helping women who find themselves in a challenging or unexpected pregnancy.\u201cTo ensure that our pregnancy resource centers are fully equipped and funded and able to provide services to women to ensure that if there are housing concerns, maternal health care, all of those concerns, we want to make sure that they are met for women here in Wisconsin,\u201d Skogman said.Skogman said that could include pushing for more public funding of pregnancy resource centers.\u201cWe\u2019ve already started having some of those conversations in the last couple of weeks and especially this week,\u201d Skogman said.Appling said she\u2019s open to the idea of additional public funding for pregnancy resource centers, but she doesn\u2019t want to place new requirements on many of the faith-based groups that run the facilities. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to see happen is any of that money come with strings that would tie the hands of the pregnancy resource centers in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Appling said.No support among anti-abortion groups for adding exemption for rape and incestShortly after the leak of the draft opinion that would eventually overturn Roe v. Wade, Vos said he\u2019d like to see new exceptions for rape or incest added to Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban.But asked Tuesday whether they\u2019d favor such a step, Wisconsin\u2019s anti-abortion groups said no.\u201cThat is absolutely not something that we would support,\u201d said Skogman.\u201cWe would strongly, strongly resist that,\u201d said Sande.\u201cNo, that\u2019s definitely not necessary,\u201d Appling said. \u201cThe situation surrounding the conception of a new human being does not in any way, shape or form diminish the worth, the value, the dignity inherently of that new human being.\u201dDefending the 1849 lawAll three anti-abortion groups were also united in their support for defending Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban against the lawsuit filed by Kaul and Evers.Planned Parenthood strongly supports the lawsuit, but at least for now, the group is operating as though the ban is in effect.\u201cOut of an abundance of caution we have paused providing abortion services in the state of Wisconsin until we can get clarification from a court of competent jurisdiction, that the criminal abortion ban is not enforceable,\u201d Murray said.Whether or not the law is enforceable in the short term could fall to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is currently split 4-3 between conservatives and liberals. Conservative swing Justice Brian Hagedorn, who has sided frequently with the court\u2019s liberals, once wrote in a blog as a law school student in 2005 that he hated Planned Parenthood, calling it a \u201cwicked organization.\u201dIn the longer term, whether the ban is enforced could depend not only on who wins next year\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court race but on who wins this year\u2019s elections for governor and attorney general.Kaul has vowed not to enforce the ban and Evers has pledged to grant clemency to anyone charged with violating it. The Republicans running for governor, meanwhile, have said they support the ban, and three of them said they\u2019d remove district attorneys who don\u2019t enforce it.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nOpponents and supporters of abortion access testify against 14-week ban \n\n \n\n\n\nGOP bill would restrict abortions after 14 weeks \n\n \n\n\n\nSheboygan County DA to appeal ruling that abortions are legal to Wisconsin Supreme Court \n\n \n\n\n\nIn victory for abortion rights, Dane County judge rules 19th century law does not ban abortions in Wisconsin \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
