Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls. (Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\nA bill that would add the act of transporting, recruiting or harboring minors to seek an abortion to Idaho\u2019s criminal human trafficking law was introduced in the House State Affairs Committee on Tuesday by Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls.\nThe bill also gives Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador the authority and \u201csole discretion\u201d to prosecute a person for violating any section of the section of law around human trafficking or abortion if the prosecuting attorney in the respective county refuses to bring charges.\n  Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls (Courtesy of the Idaho Legislature)\nIdaho\u2019s abortion ban applies to any stage of pregnancy, with affirmative defenses for cases of rape and incest with an accompanying police report and if an abortion is necessary to save the pregnant person\u2019s life.\nHouse Bill 98 would specifically apply to instances of transporting children under the age of 18 to receive an illegal abortion in Idaho or an abortion in a state where the practice is legal, as it is in border states like Oregon and Washington. Abortion is also permitted in up to 18 weeks of pregnancy in Utah while the state\u2019s trigger law is under consideration by the courts.\nThe bill states that those who recruit, harbor or transport pregnant minors \u201cwith the intent to deprive the pregnant minor\u2019s parents of knowledge of, and to procure, a criminal abortion\u201d would be in violation of the law and subject to two to five years in prison.\nIn the event of prosecution, the bill allows affirmative defenses in court for parents or guardians who consented to the transportation of the child, but explicitly states that seeking the abortion or abortion-inducing drugs in another state is not a defense.\nThe committee did not discuss the bill and agreed to print it. Ehardt provided few details in her introduction, but said it should be something both chambers of the Legislature can agree on.\u00a0\n\u201cWe will make sure that we have top-notch legal authority to deal with this,\u201d Ehardt told the committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want to see our minors not only trafficked, but in this situation.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe bill is co-sponsored by Rep. Kevin Andrus, R-Lava Hot Springs; Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa; and Sen. Cindy Carlson, R-Riggins. It could receive a hearing in the House State Affairs Committee in the coming days of the legislative session.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXNew bill would criminalize \u2018trafficking of minors\u2019 to receive abortions in or outside of Idaho\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun February 7, 2023\nNew bill would criminalize \u2018trafficking of minors\u2019 to receive abortions in or outside of Idaho\nby Kelcie Moseley-Morris, Idaho Capital Sun February 7, 2023\n A bill that would add the act of transporting, recruiting or harboring minors to seek an abortion to Idaho\u2019s criminal human trafficking law was introduced in the House State Affairs Committee on Tuesday by Rep.
