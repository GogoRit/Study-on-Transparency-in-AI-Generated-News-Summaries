Burbidge, a seasoned communicator viewed as a staunch defender of the right to life, was elected chair of the U.S. bishops\u2019 pro-life committee Wednesday.\nThe bishops, meeting in Baltimore for their annual fall assembly, chose Bishop Burbidge over Bishop W. Shawn McKnight of Jefferson City, Mo., by a vote of 174-63.\nThe pro-life chair was one of several high-profile leadership decisions the bishops made this week. Taken together, the moves signal that there will be no dramatic policy shifts within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for the next several years.\nNov. 15, by wide margins, the bishops elected a new conference president and vice president: Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA, and Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori, whom Bishop Burbidge will succeed as chair of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\nBoth Broglio, 70, and Archbishop Lori, 71, will serve three-year terms, commencing after the bishops\u2019 meeting ends Thursday.\nIn other key elections Wednesday, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley was elected USCCB secretary over Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark (130-104), and Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Ind., was tabbed as the next chair of the Committee for Religious Liberty over San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone (165-77).\nIn other USCCB committee chair election results:\n\nCanonical Affairs and Church Governance: Bishop Thomas J. Paprocki of Springfield, Ill., 147-91, over Bishop Alfred A. Schlert of Allentown, Pa.\nEcumenical and Interreligious Affairs: Bishop Joseph C. Bambera of Scranton, Pa., 128-111, over Bishop Peter L. Smith of Portland, Ore.\nEvangelization and Catechesis: Indianapolis Archbishop Charles Thompson, 149-90, over Bishop William D. Byrne of Springfield, Mass.\nInternational Justice and Peace: Bishop W. Elias Zaidan of the Maronite Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon, 148-95, over Philadelphia Archbishop Nelson J. Perez\nProtection of Children and Young People: Bishop Barry C. Knestout of Richmond, 127-114, over Bishop Elias R. Lorenzo, OSB, auxiliary bishop of the Newark Archdiocese\n\nBurbidge, 65, who has led the Arlington Diocese since December 2016, is regarded as an experienced teacher of the faith who has not shied away from weighing in on hot-button issues, including abortion.\n\u201cBishop Burbidge has been outspoken in his commitment to making pro-life issues a centerpiece of the activities in the Arlington diocese and the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d Olivia Gans Turner, president of Virginia Society for Human Life, said in a statement to CNA.\n\u201cI have had the pleasure to know Bishop Burbidge since he was bishop of Raleigh,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe met while we were both speaking at multiple pro-life events there. I knew he would bring that same dedication and compassion to protecting all innocent human life with him to Virginia.\n\u201cIt has been exciting to see him expand pro-life efforts in Northern Virginia. Pro-lifers of every faith and no faith congratulate him,\u201d Turner added. \u201cThe USCCB has made a good selection for this important position.\u201d\nJeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, called Bishop Burbidge \u201ca joyful and\u00a0energetic leader for life.\u201d\n\u201cHis dedication to evangelizing the dignity of every life and working for the protection and care of unborn children, their mothers, and their families resonates with clarity and conviction in the Diocese of Arlington, in Virginia, and well beyond,\u201d he said in a statement to CNA. \u201cI was excited to learn that he has been elected to chair the USCCB\u2019s pro-life committee.\u201d\nIn August 2021, Bishop Burbidge was the first U.S. bishop to publish a catechetical resource on church teaching related to transgenderism, calling for charity while also discouraging practices such as gender \u201ctransitioning\u201d and using gendered pronouns disconnected from someone\u2019s sex.\nIn May, he said that San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone\u2019s instruction to his local priests to withhold Holy Communion from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., because of her longstanding and public pro-abortion advocacy, would be respected in the Arlington diocese.\nIn October, Bishop Burbidge addressed U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s stated intention to codify a national right to abortion should Democrats win control of Congress, saying, \u201cThe role of Congress is to pass laws that serve the common good \u2014 and yet this priority of the president only brings about pain and death.\u201d\nBishop Burbidge fills the chairmanship that Archbishop Lori is vacating due to his new role as USCCB vice president. Bishop Burbidge will serve the remaining two years of Archbishop Lori\u2019s term.\nThe other chairs elected Wednesday will serve as chairmen-elect of their respective committees for one year, beginning at the conclusion of this week\u2019s assembly. After that they will serve three-year terms as chairs.\nJonah McKeown and Joe Bukuras contributed to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTopics: Pro-Life \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationwide invitation to prayer \n\n\n\n3/15/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     2\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach life has immeasurable value from the moment of conception, says Bishop Burbidge on IVF issues \n\n\n\n3/9/24\n\n\n\n\nReading Time\n     2\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wonders of Catholic Buffalo-Niagara \n\n\n\n3/6/24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to eNewsletter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nBuy Photos\nAbout Us\nContact Us\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArlington Catholic Herald200 N.
