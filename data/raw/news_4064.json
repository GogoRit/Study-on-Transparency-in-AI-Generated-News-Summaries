This is a worrying policy move on the part of the government, led by the Law and Justice party, and one with far-reaching consequences.\nLaw and Justice has said it doesn\u2019t necessarily support the decision of Ziobro, of the United Poland party, part of the ruling coalition. But the Law and Justice government has repeatedly used fear-mongering and hateful rhetoric about so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d to legitimize attacks on the rights of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.\nWomen, adolescents, and LGBT people bear the brunt of Poland\u2019s moves to undermine sexual and reproductive health and rights and demonize gender-nonconformity. In reality, the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (known as the Istanbul Convention) promotes protections for women and girls trying to escape abuse or seek justice. It also promotes healthy attitudes and behaviors through education on equality, non-discrimination, and conflict resolution in relationships.\nOrganizations working with women survivors of violence say the fact that Poland reports fewer cases of domestic abuse than other EU countries merely reflects how taboo the issue remains. High-level Law and Justice leaders have downplayed the problem of gender-based violence and disparaged groups working to combat it. \u201cThe whole existence of domestic violence has been denied,\u201d the leader of an organization in western Poland told me.\nThe Law and Justice government has targeted such groups through smear campaigns, raids, and defunding. The Women\u2019s Rights Centre in Warsaw cut staff and services when it lost long-term government funding, and they went from helping about 3,000 women a year to only 1,000.\nAs reports of domestic violence rise during the Covid-19 pandemic, including in Poland, governments should shore up protections rather than dismantle them.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Poland has threatened to rescind the treaty\u2019s ratification. It is part of a broader backslide on rule of law and democracy under the Law and Justice government. The European Parliament and the Council of Europe have condemned such threats and should continue doing so. Instead of abandoning commitments to protect women and girls from violence, Poland\u2019s government should choose to make their safety a priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nEurope/Central Asia European Union Poland \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 28, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: Make Vote for President Free, Fair, Safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 14, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: Reject New Curbs on Abortion, Sex Ed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cViolence with Every Step\u201d\n\n\nWeak State Response to Domestic Violence in Tajikistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 28, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: Make Vote for President Free, Fair, Safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 14, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPoland: Reject New Curbs on Abortion, Sex Ed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
