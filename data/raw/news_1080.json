Wade.\nIn the ruling issued Tuesday, Judge Christine Weems ruled that the pre-Roe abortion ban \u201cis repealed and may not be enforced consistent with the due process guaranteed by the Texas constitution.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a relief that this Texas state court acted so quickly to block this deeply harmful abortion ban,\u201d Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a press release. \u201cThis decision will allow abortion services to resume at many clinics across the state, connecting Texans to the essential health care they need. Every hour that abortion is accessible in Texas is a victory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates abortion clinics in McAllen, McKinney, Fort Worth and Austin, said it would resume providing abortions as a result of this ruling.\n\u201cWe immediately began calling the patients on our waiting lists and bringing our staff and providers back into the clinics,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the organization\u2019s president and CEO.\nAbortions can resume only at the clinics named in the lawsuit. Besides the Whole Woman\u2019s Health clinics, the others that will resume operations are Alamo Women\u2019s Reproductive Services in San Antonio, Brookside Women\u2019s Medical Center and Austin Women\u2019s Health Center in Austin, Houston Women\u2019s Clinic and Houston Women\u2019s Reproductive Services in Houston, and Southwestern Women\u2019s Surgery Center in Dallas.\nA hearing has been set for July 12 to decide on a more permanent restraining order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Tuesday\u2019s ruling is only a stopgap measure that, at most, will extend abortion access in the state for two months.\nPaul Linton, an attorney for the anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life, said he thought a higher court would soon vacate the temporary restraining order and that the pre-Roe abortion ban should stand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has any merit,\u201d Linton said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any plausible argument that the laws have been expressly repealed, and the repeal-by-implication argument, I think, is very weak.\u201d\nJohn Seago, president of Texas Right to Life, said, \u201cThe abortion industry has nothing to lose, so they\u2019re going to try to challenge every law for the next 60 days. We do believe that the pre-Roe statute is valid and that the arguments they\u2019re making to the court won\u2019t stand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA group of abortion providers filed a lawsuit Monday to prevent an old abortion ban, which predates Roe v. Wade, from being enforced before a trigger law banning most abortions in the state goes into effect.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion Friday overturning the constitutional protection on abortion, but the ruling won\u2019t be official until the court issues a formal judgment. It usually has taken the court about 25 days to issue a judgment after releasing an opinion. Texas\u2019 trigger law, which was passed last year, would go into effect 30 days after that judgment.\nAttorney General Ken Paxton issued an advisory Friday, noting that some prosecutors might immediately \u201cpursue criminal prosecutions based on violations of Texas abortion prohibitions predating Roe that were never repealed by the Texas Legislature. Although these statutes were unenforceable while Roe was on the books, they are still Texas law. Under these pre-Roe statutes, abortion providers could be criminally liable for providing abortions starting today.\u201d\nConfusion has abounded since the Supreme Court issued its decision Friday. Clinics across the state immediately stopped providing abortions out of fear that they could be criminally prosecuted under the pre-Roe abortion ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights noted in a press release that the \u201cstate\u2019s antiquated pre-Roe abortion ban ... once banned abortion entirely but has been interpreted to be repealed and unenforceable.\u201d\nThe lawsuit filed Monday notes that the pre-Roe abortion ban \u201cwas expressly declared unconstitutional in Roe and has been absent from Texas\u2019s civil statutes for decades.\u201d The Texas Legislature website also notes that the ban was \u201c\u200b\u200bheld to have been impliedly repealed\u201d in a 2004 case.\nLegislature website also notes that the ban was \u201c\u200b\u200bheld to have been impliedly repealed\u201d in a 2004 case.\nOn a press call Tuesday, Hearron declined to speculate on what the temporary restraining order on the pre-Roe ban might mean for other clinics and abortion funds in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I have an answer to that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a legal question that the other clients would want to look at.\u201d\nWhile some abortion access has been restored in Texas, current state law still allows abortions only up to around six weeks of pregnancy, a point at which many people don\u2019t even know they are pregnant.\n\u201cSo there still will be a large number of Texans who are still going to need to try to find access and appointments outside of the state,\u201d Hearron said.\nAnd he foreshadowed a not-so-distant future when even abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy will no longer be allowed in Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt some point in the future, in a couple of months, abortion will be banned,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not yet. It\u2019s not today.\u201d\n\nJoin us at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in downtown Austin, and hear from 300+ speakers shaping the future of Texas including Joe Straus, Jen Psaki, Joaquin Castro, Mayra Flores and many others.
