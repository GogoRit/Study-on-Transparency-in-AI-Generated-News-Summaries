Tony Evers calls the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature into special session to create a pathway for a statewide vote to repeal the state\u2019s 1849 ban on abortions at a news conference Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2022, in the governor\u2019s conference room in the state Capitol of Madison, Wis. Scott Bauer/AP Photo \n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Tony Evers unveiled a plan Wednesday that would let Wisconsin residents propose citizen ballot initiatives, calling the move a \u201cpathway\u201d to repealing Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 ban on abortion.While it\u2019s not the first time Evers has called on Republicans who run the Legislature to repeal the state\u2019s pre-Civil War ban, the governor\u2019s latest proposal would be more expansive, giving members of the public the power to pass state laws on any number of issues, from redistricting to marijuana legalization.\u201cIf Republican legislators aren\u2019t going to uphold the will of the people, then the people of the state should have the right to take a stand at the ballot box,\u201d Evers said at a state Capitol news conference.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans who run the Legislature indicated almost immediately that they would reject the plan.Evers has repeatedly called special sessions of the Legislature to highlight issues where he and Republican lawmakers disagree. The latest came in June, when Evers called for a special session to rescind Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban. Weeks later, GOP leaders gaveled in and out of the session without taking any votes.The governor\u2019s latest proposal may be headed for a similar fate, but it\u2019s different from his last special session call and would represent a dramatic shift in how government works in Wisconsin. If it passed, it would let members of the public sidestep the Legislature and governor to pass laws on their own.Evers said Wednesday that GOP lawmakers should be open to the plan because U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently indicated he favored letting voters decide whether to add exemptions for rape or incest to the state\u2019s abortion ban. Evers and Johnson, R-Wisconsin, are up for reelection in November.\u201cHe said let\u2019s let the people take care of this,\u201d Evers said. \u201cAnd we agree with him.\u201dBut in a statement issued shortly after the governor introduced his plan, GOP lawmakers gave every indication it was a nonstarter in the Legislature.\u201cGovernor Evers would rather push his agenda to have abortion available until birth than talk about his failure to address rising crime and runaway inflation caused by his liberal DC allies,\u201d said Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg. \u201cHopefully, voters see through his desperate political stunt.\u201dEvers scheduled his special session for Oct. 4.Because Evers\u2019 plan would amend the state Constitution, it would first have to pass two consecutive sessions of the Legislature. That means lawmakers would need to pass the proposal this year, and then the next Legislature \u2014 elected in November \u2014 would need to pass the identical plan in 2023.The proposal would then go before voters in a statewide election to decide whether they want to allow for ballot initiatives in Wisconsin. The soonest that could happen would be 2023.If the governor\u2019s plan passed each of those steps, it would open the door to future statewide referenda that don\u2019t require the Legislature\u2019s blessing.According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 24 states have a citizen initiative process that lets people bypass their state legislatures by placing proposed laws on the ballot. Twenty-three states let voters approve or repeal an act of the legislature. Under Evers\u2019 plan, Wisconsin voters could do both.The number of signatures needed to place a question on the ballot would vary.An initiative to repeal a law passed by the Legislature would require signatures from at least 4 percent of the number of votes cast in the last election for governor, or about 107,000 people using the 2018 election as a benchmark. Proposing a new law would raise that threshold to 6 percent, or about 160,000 signatures. And getting a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot would require signatures from 8 percent of voters, or about 214,000 people.Voters in other states where ballot initiatives are allowed have put the power to use. In Michigan this year, voters will decide whether to put the right to an abortion in the state\u2019s constitution. Other states are considering ballot initiatives this year to legalize recreational marijuana. And in 2018, voters in Colorado, Missouri and Michigan approved ballot measures calling for nonpartisan redistricting.Evers has proposed all three ideas, but they\u2019ve gone nowhere in the Legislature.\u201cYou think about all the items that, in this state, polling shows the vast majority of people support,\u201d Evers said Wednesday. \u201cAny one of those would eventually be fair game.\u201dWhile other issues could eventually be on the table, Evers\u2019 pitch Wednesday focused almost entirely on abortion rights, one of the centerpieces of his reelection bid against Republican challenger Tim Michels, who supports the state\u2019s abortion ban without exceptions.In the most recent poll by Marquette University, 63 percent of registered voters said they opposed the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. And 83 percent said they supported allowing a woman to obtain a legal abortion if she became pregnant as the result of rape or incest.While Evers cited Johnson\u2019s recent comments as a reason Republicans should support his special session, Johnson criticized the governor in a statement provided by his office.\u201cOnce again, Democrats are seeking to divide the public by exploiting the profound moral issue of abortion by politicizing it before an election that should be focused on the disastrous results of their policies and governance,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause of the profound nature of this decision, we should not rush the debate, but instead allow enough time for a thorough and thoughtful discussion.\u201dMichels\u2019 campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the Wisconsin Legislature did (and didn\u2019t do) in its final months of session \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin Republicans move to amend constitution as Assembly session winds to a close \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin Republicans seek to curtail governor\u2019s veto power \n\n \n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nOpponents and supporters of abortion access testify against 14-week ban \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
