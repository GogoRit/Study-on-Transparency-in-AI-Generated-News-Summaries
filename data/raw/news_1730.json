Wade Supreme Court decision. [\u00a0AYA DIAB  |  Times\u00a0]By News Service of FloridaPublished Jan. 23, 2023|Updated Jan. 24, 2023TALLAHASSEE \u2014 The Florida Supreme Court on Monday rejected requests to halt a law that prevents abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.Justices, in a 4-1 decision, turned down a motion by seven abortion clinics and a doctor for a stay of a ruling by the 1st District Court of Appeal that kept the law in place. The one-paragraph decision did not detail the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning.At a minimum, the decision will keep the law in effect until the Supreme Court can rule on underlying issues in the case. Justices Charles Canady, Ricky Polston, John Couriel and Jamie Grosshans were in the majority, while Justice Jorge Labarga wrote a short dissent.\u201cIn view of this (Supreme) Court\u2019s longstanding precedent, I conclude that the petitioners have met the exacting burden required for this Court to stay the First District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision pending review in this Court,\u201d Labarga wrote.Chief Justice Carlos Muniz and Justice Renatha Francis did not take part.The majority\u2019s decision did not directly address a major question in the case: whether the Supreme Court will reverse decades of legal precedent that has said a privacy clause in the state Constitution protects abortion rights.Related: Ashley Moody's office takes aim at Florida privacy clause in abortion fightThe decision and a similar 4-1 ruling Monday on another issue involving a stay came about five months after the 1st District Court of Appeal tossed out a temporary injunction issued by Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper, who said the 15-week limit violated the privacy clause in the Constitution.The appeals court ruled the plaintiffs could not show \u201cirreparable harm\u201d from the 15-week limit, which lawmakers and Gov. Ron DeSantis approved last year amid a national debate about abortion rights.The plaintiffs quickly took the case to the Supreme Court and asked for a stay of the appeals court ruling to prevent the law from being in effect while the legal battle continued. Earlier, the plaintiffs had asked the Supreme Court to vacate an automatic stay that had been imposed on Cooper\u2019s ruling after it went to the appeals court. The other 4-1 decision Monday rejected that request.The clinics and physician Shelly Hsiao-Ying Tien filed the lawsuit June 1, and Cooper issued the temporary injunction July 5. The state immediately appealed, which, under legal rules, placed the automatic stay on Cooper\u2019s ruling \u2014 keeping the 15-week limit in effect.The appeals court refused to lift the automatic stay and subsequently rejected Cooper\u2019s temporary injunction.In their Aug. 31 motion for a stay filed at the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs contended that the 1st District Court of Appeal had not followed precedents.\u201cGranting plaintiffs\u2019 requests to stay the First DCA\u2019s decision and allow the injunction to take effect would restore the status quo while litigation continues and allow Floridians to resume exercise of their constitutional right to decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term or obtain a pre-viability abortion \u2014 a right that this (Supreme) Court has repeatedly recognized is encompassed by the Florida Constitution\u2019s right of privacy,\u201d said the brief, filed by attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the national law firm of Jenner & Block.But in September, Attorney General Ashley Moody\u2019s office urged the Supreme Court to reject the motion for a stay \u2014 and to go further by finding that the privacy clause does not apply to abortion rights.\u201cFlorida\u2019s Privacy Clause creates a right \u2018to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person\u2019s private life,\u2019\u201d lawyers in Moody\u2019s office wrote in one filing. \u201cThat language is naturally read to limit governmental snooping and information-gathering \u2014 but not to establish a liberty to destroy unborn (or any other) life.\u201dIf the Supreme Court ultimately goes along with Moody\u2019s arguments, it could clear the way for DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature to place more restrictions on abortions. The court has become dominated by conservative justices since DeSantis took office in 2019, at least in part because of the retirements of three longtime justices, Barbara Pariente, R. Fred Lewis and Peggy Quince, who helped make up a more liberal majority.Monday\u2019s decisions came a day after Vice President Kamala Harris made an appearance in Tallahassee to support abortion rights on the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, leaving abortion decisions up to states.By Jim Saunders, News Service of FloridaUp next:DeSantis says AP African American history class pushes a political agendaMORE FOR YOUThe latest on Florida State, ACC dueling lawsuits 52 minutes ago\u2022 SportsScenes from the Florida presidential preference primary4 hours ago\u2022 FloridaAdvertisementNotario fraud leaves immigrants vulnerable to deportationEarlier today\u2022 NewsIs Tampa\u2019s Tim Burke still a journalist?Earlier today\u2022 The Buzz on Florida PoliticsHow much will Trump win by? 4 things Florida\u2019s primary can tell usEarlier today\u2022 ElectionsUSF students begin hunger strike, confront trustees over Israel-Hamas warYesterday\u2022 NewsClearwater\u2019s election is here.
