Stephen Lynch, right.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Robbie for Congress, Michael Brochstein/Sipa via AP\n\n\n\nWith just over two weeks left until the Massachusetts Democratic primary, progressives across the country are focused on the high-profile primaries of Sen. Ed Markey, who is fending off a challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy, and Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse, who is running against House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal.\nElsewhere in the state, other progressive challengers are struggling to attract similar attention. In the crowded House race to replace Kennedy, two progressives appear tied for third behind two more conservative Democrats. And in the Boston-area 8th Congressional District, Robbie Goldstein, a 36-year-old primary care physician, is scrambling to get his name out and convince voters he\u2019s not running a long-shot bid.\nOn Wednesday, Goldstein\u2019s campaign released a poll claiming he trailed just 7 percentage points behind nine-term moderate incumbent Rep. Stephen Lynch. Conducted last weekend by Lincoln Park Strategies, the poll found that 29 percent of likely voters remain undecided. However, Lynch held a clear advantage when it came to name recognition, with roughly 70 percent of voters knowing who he was, compared to 40 percent recognizing Goldstein. Still, the pollsters concluded Goldstein \u201chas a real chance to win\u201d because among undecideds, 42 percent said they\u2019d prefer to vote for a more progressive candidate, 71 percent said they\u2019d prefer a pro-choice candidate, and 73 percent said they\u2019d prefer a candidate who backs Medicare for All.\nGoldstein\u2019s case against Lynch rests on substantive policy differences, including Medicare for All and reproductive rights. The incumbent opposes single-payer health care, and while Lynch has criticized federal efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and \u201cdraconian\u201d state-level abortion restrictions, he himself identifies as pro-life and believes ending pregnancies should be \u201clegal and rare.\u201d\nGoldstein\u2019s campaign argues that this race presents a viable opportunity to bring another progressive to Congress, even if Lynch is not as influential as other incumbents who\u2019ve been toppled, like Reps. Joe Crowley and Eliot Engel. \u201cI am constantly confounded by progressives\u2019 infatuation with claiming these big headline victories instead of just winning and building power,\u201d said Karen Clawson Cosmas, Goldstein\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cWe can replace a do-nothing moderate Democrat with someone who is actually a champion of the issues of the progressive wing of the party.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynch has long been the most conservative member of the Massachusetts delegation, though he argues that\u2019s all relative for their deep blue state. \u201cCalling me the least liberal member from Massachusetts is like calling me the slowest Kenyan in the Boston Marathon,\u201d Lynch quipped a decade ago in the Boston Globe.\nGoldstein is hoping for a surge in the final weeks \u2014 similar to what Cori Bush saw recently in St. Louis, and Jamaal Bowman in New York \u2014 though Goldstein trails them both in fundraising and major endorsements, and he has far less name recognition than Bush, a Ferguson activist who ran for Congress in 2018 and was featured in a documentary alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. By the end of June, Goldstein had raised just $292,000, next to Lynch\u2019s $660,000, though Goldstein did raise more in June than in the previous five months combined.\nTo some extent Goldstein is banking on complacency from his opponent. In the last quarter Lynch raised just $45,000, and has spent no money to date on TV or Facebook ads. Also, unlike some of his Massachusetts colleagues running for reelection, Lynch has had no members of Congress campaigning on his behalf. Goldstein says this is a reflection of his opponent \u201cnot having any friends left in Washington.\u201d\nGoldstein, meanwhile, is backed by left-wing groups like Indivisible, Our Revolution, Progressive Massachusetts, and even the Boston Teachers Union. Justice Democrats, which endorsed Morse, has stayed out of this primary, after having considered backing another progressive physician, Mohammad Dar, who entered the race almost a year before Goldstein did, but dropped out early due to personal reasons.\nLynch\u2019s campaign spokesperson, Scott Ferson, said they are confident about the representative\u2019s standing in the district and resources available left to campaign. \u201cWe have a voter engagement plan in place, and he\u2019s not fundraising just to stockpile money,\u201d Ferson said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing things in a way that fits this race.\u201d\nLynch, who grew up poor in South Boston public housing and spent two decades as an ironworker, was first elected to Congress in 2001. He represents a district that over the last two decades has grown both more diverse and more gentrified. Following the 2010 Census, Lynch\u2019s district boundaries were redrawn, and while Joe Biden won every city and town in the 8th Congressional District on Super Tuesday, Goldstein says there\u2019s a real path to victory, since Warren and Bernie Sanders racked up more votes in the district overall than Biden.\nAn Irish Catholic proud of his ties to blue-collar workers, Lynch has voiced concerns about the party drifting too far left and is critical of the term \u201csocialism,\u201d which he warns could scare off older voters. Ferson argues that Lynch remains \u201cwell-in-tune\u201d with his district and has handily defeated candidates who have run to his left in the past. In 2018, Lynch was challenged by Brianna Wu, a software engineer who ran on Medicare for All and tackling income inequality, and beat her with 71 percent of the vote.\nThe sharpest contrast between the two candidates revolves around health care. Ironically one of Lynch\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities is that he was just one of 45 House Democrats to vote against the Affordable Care Act\u00a0in 2010, and of those Democrats, only three remain in Congress. Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the three, lost his primary in March to progressive challenger Marie Newman.\nAt the time, Lynch explained he voted no because he felt the final version gave too much power to the insurance industry and would lead to spiking prices, and he opposed how the bill taxed union health care plans and eliminated opportunities for state public options.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Lynch] is as conservative as Lipinski, but I do think the thing that sticks with people here is him having voted against the Affordable Care Act, given how much activism there was around that,\u201d said Jonathan Cohn, a leader with Progressive Massachusetts, a statewide advocacy group. \u201cPeople remember that.\u201d\nLynch, for his part, has criticized Goldstein for trying to \u201crip out the ACA root and branch\u201d and says he\u2019s proud of the work done to repeal the tax on union health care plans. Goldstein \u201cwants to dismantle the ACA and get rid of it, so if you ask me who really supports the ACA, that\u2019s Stephen,\u201d said Ferson, Lynch\u2019s spokesperson.\nLynch, who has long self-described as an anti-abortion Democrat, notably began moving left in 2013, when he ran against Ed Markey for the Senate seat left open when John Kerry became secretary of state. As a state legislator in Massachusetts, Lynch tried to ban abortions after 24 weeks, and in Congress he voted to support the \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d ban. But in 2013, Lynch made clear that while he was pro-life and wanted abortions to remain \u201crare,\u201d he would seek to protect Roe v. Wade and vote against any Supreme Court nominee who wanted to overturn the decision.\nHe\u2019s moved even further left in recent years. In 2019,\u00a0he\u00a0wrote a Boston Globe op-ed condemning states for their new abortion restrictions and Congress for trying to defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cIf these recent developments define the \u2018pro-life\u2019 movement, you can count me out,\u201d he wrote. Lynch received 100 percent ratings from NARAL Pro-Choice America for the last five years, but neither NARAL nor Planned Parenthood is endorsing in the primary.\nGoldstein, who has also been endorsed by local chapters of the Sunrise Movement, is campaigning on being more aggressive on climate change than the incumbent. Lynch was an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, though has said the 10-year timetable outlined in the resolution to transition completely off fossil fuels is \u201cunrealistic.\u201d Lynch originally was a strong supporter of the Keystone Pipeline, but reversed his position on that in 2013. In a recent primary debate, Lynch urged viewers to look at his ratings from the League of Conservation Voters, where he has a \u201clifetime score\u201d of 95 percent.\nGoldstein has repeatedly blasted Lynch for once calling climate change an \u201celitist\u201d issue, a charge based on a 2017 CommonWealth magazine article, though the full quote and context is not included in the piece. Lynch has denied using that descriptor.\nWhile Lynch\u2019s campaign disputes that he used that exact word, Ferson, his spokesperson, linked the sentiment to\u00a0Lynch\u2019s background as an ironworker and the congressman\u2019s belief that lawmakers shouldn\u2019t be \u201ccavalier\u201d when discussing job loss associated with transitioning off fossil fuels. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the context of who do we need to include when we\u2019re having those discussions,\u201d said Ferson. \u201cAnd he supports the Green New Deal in part because it\u2019s so focused on creating new jobs.\u201d\nShawn Zeller, the author of the CommonWealth article who now works as an editor at CQ Roll Call, told The Intercept that Lynch had made the reference in the context of his support for Tim Ryan for House speaker. \u201cTrump had just won the presidency and Lynch was among those who felt Pelosi was leading the party too far left,\u201d Zeller wrote in an email. \u201cIn an interview with me, he mentioned climate change as an example and said he preferred Democrats focus on lunch bucket issues to help the working class.\u201d\nOn issues of immigration, there are differences between the candidates too. Over the objections of President Barack Obama in 2015, Lynch voted to tighten vetting standards for refugees from Iraq and Syria, and in 2018 he voted in favor of a resolution lauding Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even when 133 House Democrats just voted \u201cpresent.\u201d While Lynch has condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s child separation policy and backed a 2019 resolution to establish standards of care at border facilities, some of his constituents say he\u2019s moved too slowly, and been too quiet overall.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just not interested in engaging with constituents who are looking for someone with a sense of urgency,\u201d said Tonya Tedesco, a Boston activist who organized trips to Lynch\u2019s district offices last summer to press him on immigration. \u201cWe are in crisis mode and I do not know that he recognizes that.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Rachel M.
