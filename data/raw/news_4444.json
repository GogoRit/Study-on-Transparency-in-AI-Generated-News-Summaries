Russo  case on March 4, 2020, in Washington, D.C.Sarah Silbiger / Getty Images\n\nBefore the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, a group of ministers and rabbis launched what became the largest abortion referral support service in the United States. The Clergy Consultation Service (CCS) helped hundreds of thousands of people access safe abortions because its members saw saving these people\u2019s lives as a moral obligation.\nNow, with the repeal of legal abortion all but assured by Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, people of faith are again mobilizing to fulfill that obligation.\n\u201cThe church is going to become front and center to this all over again in the same way that CCS was,\u201d Elaina Ramsey, executive director of the Ohio Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, told Truthout.\nThat work could range from making out-of-state referrals for people who live in states like Ohio that will automatically ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, to more direct action \u2014 or what Ramsey called \u201cprophetic civil disobedience.\u201d\n\u201cThat may mean congregations really involved in self-managed abortions through the abortion pill,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cThat might mean ordering it for your congregants and teaching people that it\u2019s a safe practice.\u201d\n\nRelated Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n|\nReproductive Rights\n\n\nAmy Coney Barrett Signed Anti-Abortion Letter From Extremist Group Against IVF\n\n\nThe letter, which Barrett signed in 2006, described Roe v. Wade as a \"barbaric\" ruling.\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\nChris Walker\n\n, \n\n Truthout\n\n\nOctober 1, 2020\n\n\n\n\nTruthout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe church is going to have to become another space for that, kind of very similar to how the sanctuary movement reacts and responds to unjust immigration policies,\u201d Ramsey added.\nJewish leaders are preparing, too. In June, the National Council of Jewish Women launched Rabbis for Repro, a network that includes 1,000 Jewish leaders across every denomination who have pledged to preach and teach about reproductive rights, according to the council\u2019s scholar in residence, Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg.\n\u201cIf we need to show up and be literally on the ground helping people get the care they need then we will do that,\u201d Ruttenberg said. \u201cWe have done it before.\u201d\nIn 1967, 21 Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis in New York City announced they had formed a network to help people obtain abortions, even though the procedure was allowed in New York only if pregnant person\u2019s life was in danger. Soon, clergy members across the United States and Canada were helping people access safe abortions through what scholar Bridgette Dunlap described in The Atlantic as a \u201ca kind of pre-Internet Yelp for illicit abortion providers.\u201d After New York legalized abortion in 1970, the clergy opened a clinic there. This history, and the involvement of people of faith in the struggle for reproductive rights since then, belies the common myth that all people of faith oppose abortion.\n\u201cThat understanding of abortion, and particularly saying that abortion is against religious law, is actually a particular, Christian, conservative interpretation,\u201d Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of the Jewish human rights organization T\u2019ruah, told Truthout. \u201cJudaism has a much more complex understanding of abortion, including that life does not begin at conception, it begins at birth; the life of the mother always comes before the fetus.\u201d In fact, abortion becomes an obligation under Jewish law if the pregnant person\u2019s life is at risk, Jacobs said. Eighty-three percent of Jews believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. \nWhile a majority of white Evangelical Protestants want abortion to be illegal in all or most cases, that opinion does not hold across other Christian groups. A long-term Pew study released in 2019 showed that 56 percent of Catholics, 60 percent of white mainline Protestants and 64 percent of Black Protestants believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. In a new report, Fred Clarkson, a leading analyst of the Christian Right for the social justice think tank Political Research Associates, asks how this mass of people could become a movement.\n\u201cThere is a vast pro-choice religious community with a vibrant history and world\nchanging potential,\u201d Clarkson writes. \u201cThis enormous sector of American society is under-recognized, under-reported on, and under-organized. Because this is so, it is also a virtually untapped source of power and hope for the future of reproductive freedom, access, and justice.\u201d\nIn the 1970s, conservative operatives incensed by government attempts to desegregate religious schools seized on abortion as a political cause they believed would mobilize Evangelical voters. In the decades since, the Christian Right has built power in part through so-called parachurch organizations \u2014 entities that have a religious mission but operate across and often in coalition with multiple religious denominations. Groups like Youth for Christ and Focus on the Family have \u201cevangelized, recruited, and trained people in theologies, skills, and ecumenical organizing activities,\u201d Clarkson writes. Meanwhile, legal powerhouses like the Alliance Defending Freedom have advanced an anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ agenda in the name of religious freedom, cinching 60 victories in the Supreme Court. (Attempts to advance progressive ideals in the name of religious liberty have fared less well in the courts.) The Christian Right has succeeded in chipping away at abortion access in part because its participants have set aside major differences in order to build a unified political force. Catholics and Southern Baptists, for example, have clashed historically over which version of Christianity is authentic \u2014 and yet they have been willing to work together, Clarkson said. \n\u201cThe Christian Right overcame all kinds of historic differences to arrive at the political place where they are,\u201d Clarkson told Truthout in an interview. \u201cThey despise each other, don\u2019t trust each other and are competing against one another \u2014 how did they manage to find enough commonality so that they could join forces in that way and set aside their differences for common purpose?\u201d\nThe pro-choice and progressive religious communities face a more complex path to this kind of consensus, in part because they are more racially and religiously diverse, and because they operate more democratically than, say, the Catholic Church. \u201cHow the moderate to progressive religious community would do that will be different, but as soon as they decide that that\u2019s what they have to do, the path to progress and even historic victory will emerge,\u201d Clarkson said.\nPerhaps the most hopeful element of Clarkson\u2019s report is that it highlights the work already underway to awaken what he describes, in an accompanying essay for Religion Dispatches, as a \u201csleeping giant.\u201d An annotated directory attached to the report points to the pro-choice and reproductive justice elements of faith traditions, including Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Native American perspectives. What emerges is a set of nuanced and diverse spiritual understandings of abortion at odds with the monolithic narrative claimed by the Christian Right.\nAmong the report\u2019s most promising examples of interfaith work is the Texas Freedom Network (TFN)\u2019s campaign to educate congregations in one of the most restrictive states for abortion access. The organization has mobilized 25 congregations that publicly affirm three principles: They \u201ctrust and respect women\u201d; they treat people without \u201cstigma, shame, or judgment\u201d for their reproductive decisions; and they believe that \u201caccess to comprehensive and affordable reproductive health services is a moral and social good.\u201d\nAnother 70 congregations are considering adopting these principles; because the goal is to change the culture of abortion stigma, the process of educating and engaging with these congregations can take a long time, Reverend Erika Forbes, outreach and faith coordinator for TFN, told Truthout. \nForbes has worked to destigmatize abortion among people of faith by speaking from the pulpit about her own two abortions and by promoting an expansive vision of religious freedom.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the entire life cycle of any human being, and what does it mean to talk about the freedom to choose when you have children, whether you can parent those children in healthy and safe communities, and [have] access to the particular ways in which children and families thrive?\u201d Forbes told Truthout. \u201cWhen we put it in that framework and when we are very clear as people of faith consistently with that message, then we become the same force that we see in the Evangelical or in conservative communities.\u201d\nLike Clarkson, Forbes has chosen a message of hope that religious and secular activists alike may find encouraging in the weeks to come, as the Republican-led Senate moves to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. \u201cI know that right now it seems dire, but this is when everyone can lean on people of faith because we have been prepared for times such as this,\u201d Forbes said.\nTexas is among the states that have all but regulated abortion out of existence for anyone who lacks the hundreds or thousands of dollars and multiple days that it can take to access it. But some activists believe the fall of Roe could, overnight, offer a catalyst for the kind of political movement that Clarkson envisions. \u201cThere is a deep level of resiliency that we are tapping into, the likes of which no one has ever seen, because there hasn\u2019t been a demand for it,\u201d Forbes said.\n\u201cMy message, without a doubt, is not just one of hope, but one of infinite resilience that we\u2019re coming from a wellspring that is infinite, and that when we stand on the right side of this moral argument, there will be no stopping us,\u201d Forbes added. \u201cJust as you see the resiliency and the determination of a dandelion coming through the cement, that\u2019s us, that\u2019s us as faith people, that\u2019s us as people who know that there is nothing that\u2019s going to keep us from having the right and the access to healthy, safe abortion.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not going to stand for it. Are you?\nYou don\u2019t bury your head in the sand. You know as well as we do what we\u2019re facing as a country, as a people, and as a global community. Here at Truthout, we\u2019re gearing up to meet these threats head on, but we need your support to do it: We must raise $50,000 to ensure we can keep publishing independent journalism that doesn\u2019t shy away from difficult \u2014 and often dangerous \u2014 topics.\n\nWe can do this vital work because unlike most media, our journalism is free from government or corporate influence and censorship. But this is only sustainable if we have your support.
