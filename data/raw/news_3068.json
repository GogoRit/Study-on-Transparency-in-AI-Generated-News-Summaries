She succumbed to a rare form of cancer right before Christmas. Our movement has lost a strong, passionate voice for unborn babies and their mothers.\nSue was known as a former Planned Parenthood director who decided she could no longer help the nation\u2019s largest abortion organization mislead expectant mothers to believe the tragedy of abortion is better than the challenges of young motherhood. After resigning, Sue had the courage to expose  Planned Parenthood\u2019s seedy tactics\u00a0of manipulating expectant moms to choose abortion. Her clinic and others like it actually had abortion quotas they had to meet. There were even employee incentives if they met their abortion goals\u2014everything from extra PTO to a pizza party. You can listen to Sue describe this shady practice in her own words.\nI had the privilege of getting to know Sue not just as a persuasive public speaker, but  as an ADF client\u00a0willing to invest her time and effort to hold Planned Parenthood legally accountable for some of the dubious practices she witnessed as a 17-year employee. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t win that lawsuit. And that\u2019s very disappointing for me personally. It\u2019s a privilege to represent clients like Sue who trust us to help them stand for what is right, often at the risk of losing their own reputation in this cancel-happy world. So I take it hard when we can\u2019t get them a win.\nBut the opportunity to get to know Sue through that case took the sting out of that loss. As her attorney, I accompanied Sue to several speaking opportunities across the country and heard her heart while sitting backstage or breaking for lunch. She carried joy and exuded peace wherever she went. Her easygoing, sincere manner was the same on stage and off. That quiet conviction may not have wowed audiences like a TED Talk motivational speaker, but it was incredibly persuasive.\nListening to Sue talk about  standing against the evils of the abortion industry\u00a0in\u00a0her calm, matter-of-fact way was deeply inspiring. It was like having a conversation with your mother over a sandwich and coffee.\nOne time I was with her at a studio doing a series of recordings on the deception and manipulation she saw\u2014and to her chagrin, helped perpetrate\u2014as the director of the Planned Parenthood in Storm Lake, Iowa. She was telling the story of the time her center obtained a new ultrasound machine as part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201cwebcam\u201d chemical abortion program. It pioneered this method because so few doctors are willing to do abortions. Physicians understand that an unborn baby is not just a blob of tissue\u2014despite abortionists\u2019 assurances otherwise. Even at 10 weeks, modern-day ultrasounds prove the child looks and is human\u2014she just needs time to mature and grow.\nBecause Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t want mothers to know this reality, it instructs technicians to keep the ultrasound screen turned away from the patient. They never show it to her. So Sue advised the man delivering the new machine that she didn\u2019t need to be trained on how to print a picture of the ultrasound. They would never give that to the mother because it might convince her not to have an abortion.\nSue\u2019s calm, unvarnished telling of the story left no doubt that it was completely true. She didn\u2019t need to embellish the facts. And that\u2019s why Sue was such a successful pro-life advocate. Her integrity and conviction made her compelling. And I believe there are people alive today because Sue\u2019s conviction convinced their mothers they could carry that baby\u2014even though the circumstances weren\u2019t ideal. Whether they chose to parent or allowed that child to be adopted by the thousands of couples waiting in line for newborns, those women decided not to fall for the Planned Parenthood line that killing their baby is the only real option.\nThank you for your quiet conviction and fearless advocacy, Sue. I and millions of other pro-lifers miss you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kevin Theriot\n      \n\n        Senior Counsel\n      \n\n        Kevin Theriot serves as senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom\n      \n\n\n          View Profile \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
