The U.S. was among seven countries to be considered this summer. A large delegation of U.S. officials, including Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, traveled to Geneva earlier this month for hearings that fed into the committee\u2019s thinking about the rights of ethnic and racial minorities in the U.S.\nREAD MORE: Despite state efforts to protect abortion access, Asian Americans in Michigan still see obstacles\n\u201cThe committee was deeply concerned about the disparate impact on the sexual and reproductive health and rights of racial and ethnic minorities, particularly those with low income,\u201d committee member Pansy Tlakula told reporters.\n\u201cIt recommended that the state party should take further steps to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in sexual and reproductive health and rights.\u201d\nThe committee said it received hundreds of submissions and comments from advocacy groups in the United States over issues like reproductive rights, police brutality, education, voting rights and reparations for slavery \u2014 an issue that was taken up for the first time by the panel amid signs that a push for such reparations may be gathering momentum.\n\u201cIt would have been impossible to have an honest, interactive dialogue with the United States without including the issue of reparatory justice,\u201d committee chairperson Verene Shepherd said,\u00a0presenting the committee\u2019s report. \u201cI fully believe that with the pressure in the United States now around the question of reparatory justice, that the federal government will act.\u201d\nShe also lamented \u201cpushback\u201d against critical race theory \u2014 the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions that serve to perpetuate white dominance in society \u2014 and \u201cthe issue of refusal to have a conversation around slavery.\u201d She said that issue was \u201cimpossible to ignore.\u201d\nTlakula of South Africa, another of the committee\u2019s 18 international members, said the United States hadn\u2019t set any timetable for enactment of any reparations. But she did say the committee had asked the United States to report back within a year on any steps taken to mitigate the impacts of the abortion restrictions and gun violence on racial minorities.\nIn its report, the committee ran the gamut of concerns and assessments \u2014 including praise for recent legislation and executive orders to improve the rights of minorities, and calls for a \u201cnational action plan\u201d to combat systemic racism and racial discrimination and an effort to limit the impact of gun violence on such minorities.\nREAD MORE: Some college students return to campus in states with new abortion bans\nIt urged consideration of new laws or a review of existing ones to help fight excessive use of force by law enforcement, and called on the U.S. to adopt \u201call necessary measures\u201d \u2014 including at the federal level \u2014 to ensure that all people can vote. It expressed concerns about an increase in new legislation with a \u201cdisproportionate impact\u201d on minorities.\nWhile noting some steps by the White House to address high maternal mortality rates, it said: \u201cthe committee is concerned that systemic racism along with intersecting factors such as gender, race, ethnicity and migration status have a profound impact on the ability of women and girls to access the full range of sexual and reproductive health services in (the U.S.) without discrimination.\u201d\nThe concerns came in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to strip away women\u2019s constitutional protections for abortion that had been enshrined for nearly a half-century under Roe v. Wade, which paved the way for abortion bans in some states.\nThe committee, referring to the recent court decision, called on the United States to adopt \u201call necessary measures\u201d at both state and federal level \u201cto address the profound disparate impact of (the decision) on women of racial and ethnic minorities, Indigenous women and those with low incomes,\u201d and provide safe, legal access to abortion under existing U.S. commitments to human rights.\nIt called on the U.S. to ensure that women seeking an abortion \u2014 or the health care providers who assist them \u2014 \u201care not subjected to criminal penalties.\u201d\nJamil Dakwar, director of the human rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the committee\u2019s conclusions \u201cshould serve as yet another wake-up call for the United States to vigorously combat and eliminate systemic racism.\u201d\n\u201cThe U.N. provided a blueprint to address structural discrimination; now the Biden administration must act to build out our domestic human rights infrastructure,\u201d he said.\nThe ACLU also hailed the committee\u2019s call to provide redress for slavery, Dakwar added.\n\u201cThe legacies of colonialism and slavery have a real-world lingering impact on present day racial disparities and injustices and we must address them head on,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                The United Nations headquarters building is seen from inside the General Assembly hall before heads of state begin to address the 76th Session of the U.N.
