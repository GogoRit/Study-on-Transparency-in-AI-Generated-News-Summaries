But, he said, the decision to terminate a pregnancy in the initial months is \u201cbetween a person and their God.\u201dOn other issues, O\u2019Dea sounds like a typical conservative. He wants to cut back government regulation and expand oil and gas production, and he opposes gun restrictions. But his support for abortion rights in most cases stands out in a Republican Party in which opposition to the procedure has become a bedrock principle.\n\nHis top rival in Tuesday\u2019s primary is state Rep. Ron Hanks, who opposes abortion in all circumstances. The two are competing to take on Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, who won his first Senate race in 2010 by hammering his GOP challenger over opposition to abortion rights.\nRepublican voter Carla Davis, who describes herself as \u201c100% pro-life,\u201d thinks O\u2019Dea will be a stronger candidate in the general election against Bennet in a state that has voted down initiatives to limit or ban abortion four times since 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to concede on small things to make things work,\u201d said Davis, a 60-year-old marketing executive who attended a recent O\u2019Dea event.Still, if O\u2019Dea does win the Republican primary, it will partly be due to a financial advantage rather than a strategic choice by GOP voters. He has spent more than $600,000 of his own money on his Senate run, while Hanks\u2019 campaign has raised less than $60,000.Hanks, who said he marched to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but did not enter the building during the insurrection, said O\u2019Dea\u2019s views do not align with those of most Republican primary voters.\n\n\u201cHis policy positions would put him to the left of Mitt Romney,\u201d Hanks said in an interview, referring to the Republican senator from Utah. \u201cThe message is not Republican, it\u2019s not conservative, it\u2019s not pro-life.\u201dHanks has gotten some help from a Democratic group that sees him as an easier opponent for Bennet. The group has reported spending at least $2.5 million in the GOP primary, airing ads designed to promote Hanks\u2019 candidacy. The spots warns that he\u2019s \u201ctoo conservative\u201d for backing a complete abortion ban and letting anyone carry firearms in public.Conservatives fear something similar would happen if Hanks is the nominee. \u201cRather than talking about the economy, rather than talking about inflation, you\u2019ll be talking about abortion,\u201d said Mario Nicolais, a lawyer and activist who left the Republican Party partly over criticism he received after backing a ballot measure to ban abortions at 22 weeks. The critics wanted abortion banned completely.To Nicolais, that demonstrates how rigid some Republicans are in their opposition to abortion rights, part of what has marginalized them in the state. The 22-week ban failed at the polls in November 2020, just as voters rejected other initiatives to limit or ban abortion in 2008, 2010 and 2014.\n\nColorado in 1967 became the first state to loosen restrictions on abortion, six years before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Roe v. Wade guaranteed the right to an abortion nationally in 1973. This year, the Democratic-controlled legislature passed a law guaranteeing full access to abortion in the state even the Supreme Court overturns Roe. A leaked draft opinion from the high court indicates that could happen by the time the court\u2019s term ends this month, around the same time as Colorado\u2019s Tuesday primary.Bennet\u2019s campaign has cited that looming decision as a reason for Colorado voters to be wary of the GOP.\u201cBoth Republican candidates are too far right for our state,\u201d spokesperson Georgina Beven said in a statement. \u201cColoradans have an even deeper sense of urgency now to elect pro-choice candidates this November, and Michael will always be committed to protecting women\u2019s reproductive rights in the US Senate.\u201d\n\nIf O\u2019Dea were to be elected, he would join Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski as the only Republican senators who publicly support Roe v. Wade.Still, Colorado is home to a core group of strong opponents of abortion rights, including many religious groups alarmed at the prospect of not having a like-minded candidate on the Senate ballot in the fall.\u201cThe dignity of every person \u2014 born and pre-born \u2014 should be unassailable and non-negotiable,\u201d said Paul J. Batura, a spokesperson for the religious group Focus on the Family, which is not involved in the primary. \u201cCome November, Coloradoans and voters everywhere deserve the opportunity to express their pro-life convictions at the ballot box.\u201d \n\nThe biggest conservative event in the state is the Western Conservative Summit, sponsored by Colorado Christian University. It was there, in a vast resort near Denver International Airport, that O\u2019Dea got a polite reception from the crowd, which was largely quiet while he briefly discussed abortion. Hanks, who preceded him, was greeted with roars when he outlined his unyielding stance on the issue.\u201cWhen we fight for life, we don\u2019t fight for life some of the time, we fight for all of it,\u201d Hanks said. \u201cBecause everybody deserves a birthday.\u201dO\u2019Dea jabbed at Hanks, a former Army intelligence officer who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in California in 2010. Hanks said he opposed abortion, but his campaign literature said he held \u201ca measured and narrow window for medical experts.\u201d That caveat led O\u2019Dea to accuse Hanks of \u201chaving his finger in the wind.\u201d Hanks, in an interview, said he changed position because improvements in medical technology make it easier to save a mother\u2019s life in case of complications.But most of O\u2019Dea\u2019s speech didn\u2019t involve abortion, an issue that he says he never hears about from voters. Most voters, O\u2019Dea said in an interview, are worried about inflation and crime, two issues he\u2019s hit relentlessly on the campaign trail.A political novice, O\u2019Dea has donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past. He gave $500 to Bennet in 2010. O\u2019Dea said that he made most of his donations to Democrats when he chaired a construction industry organization that paid to attend campaign fundraisers and that he would ask for his Bennet donation back while debating the incumbent, if O\u2019Dea was the GOP nominee.O\u2019Dea says he voted twice for Donald Trump but that he has no opinion on whether the former president should run again and volunteered that he liked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential Trump rival in 2024. O\u2019Dea said he supported Trump\u2019s nominees to the Supreme Court, who are among the justices appearing to back overturning Roe, and saw no contradiction between that and his views on abortion.\u201cI\u2019m not running on social issues,\u201d O\u2019Dea said, \u201cand people aren\u2019t talking about social issues, except reporters and Ron Hanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
