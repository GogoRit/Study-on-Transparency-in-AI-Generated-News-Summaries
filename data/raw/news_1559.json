She had been there once before, for a consultation with Dr. Sidney Babbitz. Babbitz was 59 years old and had mostly retired to Florida. But he was known in whisper networks as a doctor who was willing to perform illegal abortions back in Wisconsin. \n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woman handed Babbitz a stack of 18 $50 bills \u2014 $900 total \u2014 and Babbitz gave her an abortion. On their way out of the office, Babbitz saw a police officer in the hallway. He told the woman to go back into his office and gave her some pills he said he had forgotten. When they thought the coast was clear, Babbitz took the elevator with her down to the building\u2019s lobby. Another police officer was there waiting for them. What happened next led to a yearslong legal battle, one that eventually upended more than a century of abortion law in Wisconsin. Only hours after her abortion, prosecutors got the woman to appear in a Milwaukee County courtroom. Initially, she declined to answer questions. At several points, a transcript shows, officials had to ask her to speak up.After the judge gave her immunity from prosecution, she described how Babbitz used dilation and curettage to terminate her pregnancy at about nine weeks. Her testimony was enough for a judge to grant a warrant to search Babbitz\u2019s office. That led to the doctor\u2019s arrest, which would spiral into a lawsuit. In 1970, that suit led a federal court to strike down much of a Wisconsin law that had banned abortions. \nA court document shows testimony from a woman who received an abortion from Milwaukee physician Dr. Sidney Babbitz in 1969. Prosecutors brought the woman before a judge hours after she received the abortion.\u00a0Court documents via National Archives at Chicago\nA few years later, the Babbitz verdict was overshadowed when the U.S. Supreme Court established federal protections for abortion through Roe vs. Wade in 1973. But, now, more than a half a century since the court decision, the Babbitz case may have new relevance. Clinics across the state stopped performing elective abortions after Roe was overturned in June 2022. That\u2019s when the state reverted to a long-dormant 19th-century law that\u2019s widely interpreted as banning abortions unless they\u2019re done to save a pregnant patient\u2019s life. Just days after Roe was overturned, Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General sued to try and block prosecutions of abortions under that law, which is the same law used to prosecute Babbitz more than half a century prior. The AG\u2019s ongoing lawsuit briefly references the Babbitz case, noting that a federal court has previously found the law to be unconstitutionally overbroad.For newly elected prosecutor, opposition to abortion is personal When a U.S. District court issued a declaratory judgment in Babbitz\u2019s favor in 1970, the ruling was a watershed victory for Wisconsin\u2019s growing abortion-rights movement. But for E. Michael McCann, it was a blow that was both professional and personal.McCann had been Milwaukee County District Attorney for less than a year when he got a tip that Babbitz would be performing an abortion at his office. That led to the stakeout at the Majestic Building, the questioning of the young woman and to McCann charging Babbitz with a felony.McCann, now 86, is a lifelong Democrat and a devout Catholic. He\u2019s open about how his faith informs his politics \u2014 everything from his opposition to abortion and the death penalty to his support of social programs that assist the poor. \u201cI have, I guess, a deep respect for human life,\u201d McCann said in an interview at his home, \u201cand a suspicion that \u2026 whenever human life is diminished, there\u2019s a price paid for it.\u201d\nFormer Milwaukee County District Attorney Michael McCann is photographed on\u00a0 Friday, June 30, 2023. Angela Major/WPR\nFor McCann, the case against Babbitz was straightforward. Abortion had been mostly or entirely illegal in Wisconsin since the state was less than a year old, with the first law restricting abortion passed in 1849. McCann had ironclad evidence that Babbitz had performed an abortion.\u201cWe were not thinking we would find some brand new case law coming up, some new theory of law,\u201d McCann said.Babbitz died in 1984. Members of his family declined to speak with WPR or did not respond to requests for comment. The woman who went to Babbitz for an abortion did not respond to requests for comment; she was never charged with any crime and WPR is not naming her.Legal historian Mary Ziegler, who has written extensively on abortion and the law, said the women who received abortions weren\u2019t typically the ones prosecuted. But prosecutors sometimes used the threat of legal trouble to pressure women into testifying against medical providers.\u201cInstead of actually prosecuting women, they would say, \u2018We won\u2019t prosecute you if you turn state\u2019s witness,\u2019\u201d Ziegler explained.It\u2019s not clear from the hearing transcript whether the woman had a lawyer during the hearing that took place on the same day she had her abortion \u2014 the one where a judge granted a warrant to search Babbitz\u2019s office.She did have an attorney by the time she testified at a preliminary hearing in December 1969, so that the judge could establish probable cause for the charge against Babbitz.Before that court appearance, she visited another doctor at the urging of prosecutors, where she underwent a vaginal examination. That doctor testified about his clinical observations during the hearing, so that prosecutors could establish the woman was no longer pregnant and had likely had an abortion.These facts were never disputed. But in the end, the case became about a broader constitutional question. Babbitz sued and a panel of three federal judges took up the case. That forced the state to defend the abortion law itself.\u201cThe issue became, you know, what were her rights?\u201d McCann said. \u201cDid she have a right to have an abortion? If she had a right to have an abortion, then Babbitz had not violated the law by giving her an abortion.\u201cAs grassroots activism takes off, a Milwaukee-area housewife joins the fightBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, campaigns to legalize abortion were growing all over the country. But compared to today, views on abortion were less aligned with political parties. Historian Dave Garrow says abortion-rights groups were mostly grassroots.\u201cOpposition to abortion was by no means a Republican issue, nor was abortion rights a unanimously Democratic issue,\u201d said Garrow, whose book \u201cLiberty and Sexuality: The Right to Privacy and the Making of Roe v. Wade\u201d looks at the legal and cultural movements for abortion rights. \u201cThese local efforts were surprisingly uncoordinated at any national level or by any nationwide organization.\u201dIn Wisconsin, one of those local leaders was Edith Rein. Rein was a stay-at-home mother of two young daughters in suburban Milwaukee\u2019s Whitefish Bay when she watched the 1965 documentary \u201cAbortion and the Law,\u201d which delved into the risks faced by women who had illegal abortions.Already active in the Milwaukee chapter of the American Humanist Association, which advocates for a separation of church and state, Rein discussed with the group how they might push for abortion rights. \u201cEverybody was very happy to do something, except nobody wanted to do it publicly,\u201d Rein said. \u201cEverybody was so afraid. So I said, OK, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nEdie Rein, 89, is the former president of the Wisconsin Committee to Legalize Abortion, which was active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Rein was also part of an underground network that referred women to abortion services.\u00a0Roberto Roldan/For Wisconsin Public Radio\nShe founded the Wisconsin Committee to Legalize Abortion, appearing on radio and TV to debate the issue. She organized demonstrations in support of legalizing abortion, and urged support for the efforts of liberal state Rep. Lloyd Barbee, D-Milwaukee, who introduced bills to legalize abortion in Wisconsin in 1968 and 1969.Something else happened once when Rein became a public advocate of abortion access: Her phone started ringing.\u201cI started getting phone calls from people asking if I knew where to get an abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know. And then one day I got a phone call from somebody anonymous who gave me a phone number and said, \u2018You can give this phone number and people can get abortions.\u2019\u201dSoon, Rein was part of the underground network connecting women to abortion services. She took calls at all hours, from sometimes-desperate people. \u201cYou hear every story on earth,\u201d said Rein, now 89. \u201cI would get so emotional hearing some of these stories. \u2026 A lot of the women who called would say to me: \u2018I have so many kids, I can\u2019t deal with another one. And my husband will not use birth control.\u2019\u201dSelling birth control to unmarried people was illegal in Wisconsin until 1974. Even married women could have trouble getting it without their husbands\u2019 permission.When she was interviewed by the Milwaukee Sentinel in 1970, Rein told a reporter she never gave women instructions for doing anything illegal. But, now, Rein readily admits that wasn\u2019t true. She used to send women to Babbitz and other doctors, many of whom did abortions secretly.\nEdie Rein, 89, has affixed an abortion-rights Planned Parenthood sticker to the walker she uses at her senior living home in Louisville, Kentucky.\u00a0Roberto Roldan/For Wisconsin Public Radio\nMore than 50 years later, Rein has few memories of Babbitz himself. But her group submitted an amicus brief on his behalf in the 1970 case and she remembers being in the courtroom during oral arguments. She was unimpressed by Babbitz\u2019s lawyers, but said it became clear during the hearing that the judges would side with them.\u201cThe judges actually helped them,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey practically put words in their mouths.\u201dBabbitz\u2019s lawyers tried a number of different approaches. They argued Wisconsin\u2019s law was too vague. They said the ban violated the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, because rich women could get abortions more easily than poor women. They even raised concerns about overpopulation. Ultimately, the judges were most persuaded by arguments for a right to privacy in the Ninth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court had determined in Griswold v. Connecticut that privacy considerations protected the right of married couples to use contraceptives without interference from the government. In 1967, the justices again cited privacy rights when they handed down Loving v. Virginia, which made it illegal to outlaw interracial marriage.By the late \u201960s, Garrow said attorneys across the country were citing those rulings to argue for abortion rights in cases including Babbitz and eventually Roe.\u201cRoe v. Wade was by no means a singular case,\u201d Garrow said. \u201cThere were dozens and dozens of these cases, including Babbitz from Wisconsin, from all around the country.\u201cAuthorities raid Madison abortion clinic even after judges protected abortion access until \u2018quickening\u2019The three-judge panel hearing Babbitz\u2019s case in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin concluded the right to privacy protected the right to abortion up until the time of quickening. That\u2019s whenever a pregnant person can feel the fetus\u2019s movement, usually between 16 and 20 weeks into pregnancy. The U.S. Supreme Court would discuss a similar concept in Roe v. Wade when it granted the right to abortion prior to fetal \u201cviability,\u201d defined then as 23 or 24 weeks.Effectively, the Babbitz ruling made part of Wisconsin\u2019s century-old abortion ban unconstitutional. Activists like Rein celebrated. The Milwaukee-based counterculture newspaper Kaleidoscope wrote that \u201cthe decision itself might as well have been written by a far out women\u2019s liberationist.\u201d But the victory was complicated. Initially, the federal court declined to order the state to halt its prosecution of Babbitz.Babbitz\u2019s case was tied up in appeals for years. In the meantime, McCann and then-Wisconsin Attorney General Robert Warren, a Republican, kept moving forward in their attempts to bring Babbitz to trial. \nFormer Milwaukee County District Attorney Michael McCann is interviewed by Wisconsin Public Radio on Friday, June 30, 2023. Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nThe ongoing legal proceedings created an environment of uncertainty, which had ripple effects across the state.In 1971, Dr. Alfred Kennan opened the Midwest Medical Center, a clinic that provided abortions in Madison. Just months after it opened, police got a warrant to search the clinic.Annie Laurie Gaylor was 15 years old and living in Madison when Dane County District Attorney Gerald Nichol charged Kennan and four of his aides with violating Wisconsin\u2019s abortion law. \u201cThat was a scary time,\u201d Gaylor said. \u201cIt felt like a police state or something that the DA could raid a legal clinic and take all the records.\u201d\nThe Wisconsin State Journal covered the arrest of Dr. Alfred Kennan in a story from April 23, 1971. Annie Laurie Gaylor, then 15, is seen in the background, holding a sign that reads \u201cThe Pope rules Wisconsin.\u201d Via newspapers.com archive\nGaylor\u2019s mother, Anne Nicol Gaylor, was an abortion-rights activist who worked with Rein.After Kennan\u2019s arrest, Anne Nicol Gaylor spent days standing outside the Midwest Medical Center to let any patients who showed up know the clinic had been shut down. More than 300 patients had appointments pending with Kennan at the time of the raid, and activists tried to help those women get abortions elsewhere, including New York.Eventually Kennan prevailed, and the charges against him were dropped. His attorneys argued abortion had been legal in Wisconsin since the Babbitz decision in 1970. Kennan was allowed to reopen his clinic and to keep his medical license, though not before Anne Nicol Gaylor was subpoenaed by Wisconsin\u2019s Board of Medical Examiners about her work referring people for abortions. Later, when Annie Laurie Gaylor was in her early 20s, she joined forces with her mother to establish the Freedom from Religion Foundation, which advocates for the separation of church and state. Annie Laurie Gaylor said they were motivated, in part, by their encounters with religious opposition to abortion.Today, Annie Laurie Gaylor is 67 years old. She still has vivid memories from the \u201960s and \u201970s of following her mom around the country to advocate for abortion rights.\u201cI would often be left at a pro-choice table and I was 13, 14, 15,\u201d Gaylor remembered. \u201cInvariably, some middle-aged or older man would come over indignant and say, \u2018If some 16-year-old tart goes out and gets herself pregnant, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be off the hook. She should have put an aspirin in between her legs.\u2019\u201dDecades later, Gaylor can\u2019t bring herself to read the full Supreme Court decision overturning Roe. It makes her too angry.She worries that, in many ways, Wisconsin is headed back to the \u201960s.But, in Wisconsin, abortion-rights advocates hope history will soon be repeated in a different way.In July, a Dane County judge ruled that AG Kaul\u2019s lawsuit can proceed. The suit is an effort to block prosecutions of abortions under the same law that led to Babbitz\u2019s 1969 arrest. It\u2019s likely the case will make its way to Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, where liberals have gained a narrow majority after newly-elected Justice Janet Protasiewicz took office this month. Advocates hope judges will toss out Wisconsin\u2019s near-total ban on abortions, just like they did in 1970.For more from \u201cHow We Got Here: Abortion in Wisconsin since 1849,\u201d visit wpr.org/1849.Editor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Anne Nicol Gaylor\u2019s name.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris voices support for abortion access at Wisconsin visit \n\n \n\n\n\nIn victory for abortion rights, Dane County judge rules 19th century law does not ban abortions in Wisconsin \n\n \n\n\n\nHow Wisconsin\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion ban remained untouched during decades of political battle \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin\u2019s abortion law was on the books for over a century.
