The Florida House of Representatives passed the ban yesterday after the state Senate approved it earlier this month.\nThe new ban will not go into effect until 30 days after the Florida Supreme Court rules on a challenge to the state\u2019s existing 15-week ban.\nFlorida maintained harsh abortion restrictions even before this latest move. The state currently bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy and mandates patients make two separate in-person trips to a clinic, at least 24 hours apart. Young people under 18 must have consent from a parent or legal guardian, or a waiver from a judge, to have an abortion.\nEarlier this year, Human Rights Watch published a report on the extraordinary challenges young people face in navigating these barriers. We found that Florida judges routinely deny young people\u2019s requests to access abortion care without parental involvement, blocking or further delaying time-sensitive care.\nThe 6-week ban, along with these existing barriers, could place abortion out of reach for many young people. It will disproportionately harm Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other people of color; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people; immigrants; people with lower incomes; and people in rural communities.\nThe bill allocates US$25 million of state funding to fake clinics that use misinformation and shame to try to dissuade pregnant people from getting abortions.\nFlorida advocates fought tenaciously against the 6-week ban. Democratic lawmakers proposed numerous compassionate amendments, for example to lift onerous reporting requirements for survivors of rape and incest to get care beyond 6 weeks, to allow young people going through judicial bypass more time, or to reallocate funding from fake clinics to rape crisis centers. The Republican-controlled majority rejected them.\nDespite its restrictions, Florida has provided crucial access to abortion care for Floridians and people across the US South, where many states banned abortion outright after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThis new law will force pregnant people to travel outside the state care; to manage abortion outside the health system; or to continue a pregnancy against their wishes. It will force patients from neighboring states to travel longer distances for health care.\nFor now, abortion remains legal in Florida until 15 weeks of pregnancy. But make no mistake: this bill violates human rights and denies pregnant people the ability to control their bodies, lives, and futures.\nFor information about accessing abortion, visit: \nhttps://www.abortionfinder.org/\nhttps://www.ineedana.com/\nFor information about Florida\u2019s abortion funds, visit:\nhttps://floridareprofreedom.org/abortion-funds/\nFor information about parental consent and judicial bypass in Florida, visit: \nhttps://teenabortionflorida.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nChildren's Rights Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nIn Conflicting Decisions, Two US Judges Rule on Access to Safe Abortion Drug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Florida Judges Block Youth Abortion Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\n          Feature\n        \n\n\nHow Do US States Measure Up on Child Rights?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 28, 2023\n\n          Feature\n        \n\n\n\u201cI Just Want to Give Back\u201d: The Reintegration of People Sentenced to Life Without Parole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nIn Conflicting Decisions, Two US Judges Rule on Access to Safe Abortion Drug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nUS: Florida Judges Block Youth Abortion Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
