Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court case legalizing abortion, was \u201con the ballot\u201d in 2020. \n    \n\n            Louisiana voters approved Proposed Amendment No. 1 by 62% to 38%, according to CNN projections. Should Roe be overturned, the amendment would prevent the state courts from declaring abortion restrictions unconstitutional at the state level.\n    \n\n            The state isn\u2019t the first to amend its constitution this way \u2013 Alabama and West Virginia did so in 2018, as did Tennessee in 2014.\n    \n\n            The Louisiana ballot measure marked another attempt by the state to restrict abortion. The US Supreme Court struck down in June a Louisiana restriction barring doctors from performing the procedure unless they had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and a decision from a federal appellate court prevented the state\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d abortion ban, passed last year, from going into effect.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe are just so thankful, so happy that women and babies can be supported in this state,\u201d said Angie Thomas, associate director of the Louisiana Right to Life. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe are really dedicated to moving into a next chapter, which will be where abortion becomes unthinkable because every woman has enough support and love,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cif Roe v. Wade is overturned, then this state is certainly ready to become a pro-life state.\u201d\n    \n\n            Michelle Erenberg, executive director of Lift Louisiana, a reproductive rights non-profit that\u2019s part of a coalition against the amendment, told CNN that Tuesday\u2019s \u201cresult is deeply disappointing, but this feeling of sadness is temporary.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cAnyone or any organization in Louisiana who fights for reproductive freedom knows that these are hard battles to win,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut we keep fighting because women \u2013 not just those of means but all women and all people who can become pregnant \u2013 deserve the basic right of bodily autonomy and high quality reproductive healthcare, which includes abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n            In Colorado, voters rejected Proposition 115 by a 59% to 41% vote, according to CNN projections. It would have banned abortion beginning at 22 weeks of pregnancy. The measure included exceptions to save the life of the pregnant woman but not for instances of rape or incest. Doctors who continue to perform abortions at 22 weeks would have faced a fine up to $5,000.\n    \n\n            The results maintain Colorado as one of seven states that do not bar some abortions past a specific point in pregnancy, according to data from the abortion-rights research group the Guttmacher Institute. Data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s office shows that women from more than 30 states have traveled to Colorado to access abortions.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019re all sighing a breath of relief this evening,\u201d said Karen Middleton, executive director of the reproductive rights group Cobalt, which was part of a coalition formed in the spring to fight the proposed restrictions. \n    \n\n            \u201cI am grateful that Colorado voters have once again said no to intrusion on decisions about abortion access,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cColorado will continue to remain a safe haven for people to access abortion care in a moment where we don\u2019t know what might happen at the Supreme Court.\u201d \n    \n\n            Middleton added, \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this margin helps slow down the idea that they should be running these measures in other states.\u201d\n    \n\n            Giuliana Day, one of the measure\u2019s co-sponsors, said Tuesday that she was \u201cjust full of gratitude \u2013 it\u2019s been an incredible experience, and the people in Colorado have been so gracious in having these conversations.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThe results were not exactly what we were expecting, but still, as a community we came together, and we raised awareness about such a critical issue,\u201d she said, adding that she was grateful for \u201call the people and the volunteers that worked so hard for this proposition.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019re still going to keep fighting,\u201d Day said, calling her cause \u201cthe human rights issue of our lifetime.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
