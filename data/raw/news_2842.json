But, he did learn the domain www.prolifeman.org was available to purchase.Griffith bought it, without knowing what was next.In the fall of 2018, he launched Pro Life Man, a national, virtual organization based in Monroe County. In January, Pro Life Man expanded, adding Fort Hope, a support program for men suffering from the effects of abortion.\u201cI was personally convicted that I needed to do more in the pro-life movement. I needed to save babies from abortion,\u201d Griffith, a member of Redeemer Fellowship Church of Monroe, said.Pro Life Man\u2019s motto is \u201cNo Longer Silent.\u201d\u201cWe need to change the idea that since men don\u2019t have a uterus they can\u2019t have an opinion on abortion. In my view, abortion kills a human child. If that\u2019s my view, I can\u2019t be silent. I want to encourage other men to be no longer silent too,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cOur No. 1 mission is to be the voice for pre-born sons and daughters. We say \u2018sons and daughters\u2019 to rehumanize the child in the womb. Our No. 2 mission is the provide help and healing to men.\u201dHis organization targets men directly.\u201cUsually, pro-life (efforts) are very feminine and adjust slightly so men might like it. They don\u2019t really do a good job. (Our) branding and marketing is very masculine. It has a military feel. A lot of men resonate with that. Our most popular shirt says \u2018Pro-Life Warrior.\u2019 Fort Hope also has a military theme,\u201d Griffith said.Pro Life Man doesn\u2019t have in-person events. Instead, it uses social media platforms like its website, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and radio, national podcasts and blog postings to spread its pro-life messages.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone to local events, rallies and marches. In August, 2020, we had a wild game dinner fundraiser. But, we don\u2019t plan to go in-person. We have an online presence,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cWe post memes. We just had a week of Harry Potter-themed memes. We engage in popular culture and add a pro-life message. We have blog posts and arguments. We post rebuttals to popular pro-choice and pro-abortion (messages). Our entire board is licensed medical professionals. We didn\u2019t plan it that way. We give a lot of arguments from the medical side.\u201dPro Life Man has found a national audience of roughly 20,000 so far. The top three states for visitors are Michigan, Texas and California.Quickly, Griffith learned from the audience that men also needed support and healing.\u201cThis was not my plan at all, but there was this need. Men started reaching out, saying, \u2018I\u2019m hurting because of this abortion.\u2019 They had no say or they had a part in it and now regret it,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cMen are also impacted by abortion. Men can grieve that lost child.\u201dStill, he was initially hesitant.\u201cI felt in a time of prayer God was imparting on me to start this. I said, \u2018I\u2019m not the man for this job.\u2019 I don\u2019t even consider myself skilled or gifted in (support),\u201d he said.In January, Pro Life Man launched Fort Hope, which Griffith calls a \u201chealing program by men, for men.\u201d Inquiring men can receive support and someone to talk to on the phone or on Zoom.So far, six have sought support.\u201cOur vice president, Thomas White, director of Fort Hope, who also is an EMT, has this tremendous compassion and empathetic heart. He does so well with supporting others,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cWe have a plan, step-by-step and walk them through. The end goal is healing.\"The healing plan also includes connecting the men with a pastor.\u201cWe get them connected with a local pastor in their area. Our contact with them is limited. By giving them connection to a local pastor, the support can be more long-term. (The men we\u2019ve worked with so far) expressed that it helped them,\u201d Griffith said.Griffith believes the need for support for men affected by abortion is great.\u201cNo one really knows the statistics. Men are more reserved, they keep everything inside and do not want to talk about it. It\u2019s hard to study. Statistics say one in four women have had an abortion. We have to think (those numbers) are similar for men,\u201d Griffith said.Pro Life Man's website says 64,004,478 abortions have taken place in the U.S. since\u00a0Roe v. Wade.Griffith cited a study of 1,000 men who were involved in abortions. 2/3 said they felt guilt and 1/3 suffered regret.Recently, Fort Hope began a partnership with Monroe\u2019s Selah\u2019s\u00a0Center of Hope. The center will now refer men grieving aborted children to Fort Hope. Griffith said the next step is partnering with Care Net.\u201cIt\u2019s a national organization of 11,000 affiliated crisis pregnancy centers across the country. We want to partner with them and get Fort Hope in all the center. We can reach out to all the center (and tell them) if men need this kind of advice, they can refer them to us,\u201d Griffith said.Pro Life Man has a five-member board of volunteers. Only two of its staff members are paid. Griffith is the organization\u2019s president and doesn\u2019t take a salary. Other directors are White, vice president and Fort Hope director; Denise Hunter, secretary; Linda Andreoli, treasurer; Josh Lewis, board member, and Liam Slavin, communications specialist.Pro Life Man also has an advisory board of 26 people from all across Monroe County.\u201cWe reach out to them for advice and suggestions,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cLots of pastors are on the board.\u201dFor more information, visit www.prolifeman.org, Pro Life Man\u00a0on Facebook, or\u00a0pro_life_man on Instagram.Careers Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices Staff DirectoryContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.monroenews.com.
