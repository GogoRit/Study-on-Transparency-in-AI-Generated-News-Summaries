Thiessen\nThe Washington Post\nJanuary 01, 2021\n\n\n\nIn my last column, I offered my list of\u00a0the 10 worst things President Trump did in 2020. Here are the 10 best:\n10. He improved the lives of a majority of Americans. Despite the worst pandemic since 1918, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and the worst racial unrest since the 1960s, a\u00a0record 56 percent of Americans\u00a0told Gallup before the election that they were better off now under Trump than they were four years ago.\n9. He expanded GOP support among non-White voters. Trump earned 26 percent of the non-White vote in 2020 \u2014 the\u00a0second-best showing\u00a0for a Republican since 1976. After four years of branding Trump a bigot, his critics were shocked to see his\u00a0support\u00a0among Blacks and Latinos grow in 2020. The lesson is that the way to win non-White voters is not by trying to beat Democrats at identity politics, but by delivering real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\n8. He made history as the first US president to speak in person at the March for Life.\u00a0Pro-life conservatives have always been the black sheep of the Republican coalition, tolerated because their votes were needed. But Trump embraced the pro-life movement in a way no other president has \u2014 and delivered an unprecedented string of pro-life victories.\n7. He stopped the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wave.\u201d\u00a0Far from damaging his party at the polls, Trump helped Republicans stop Democrats from taking the Senate (for now) and gain\u00a0at least 11\u00a0net seats\u00a0in the House\u00a0without\u00a0losing a single Republican incumbent. Democrats are left with the slimmest House majority in 20 years and Republicans are poised to take back the House in 2022.\n6. He shut down travel from China, held Beijing responsible for the pandemic and cracked down on China\u2019s intellectual-property theft. Anthony S. Fauci\u00a0testified\u00a0that Trump\u2019s decision to shut down most travel from China in January saved lives. Trump\u00a0correctly blamed the Chinese regime for unleashing the virus\u00a0on the world through its lies and deception, and\u00a0took on\u00a0China\u2019s recruiting of US-based scientists and researchers to steal American intellectual property and taxpayer-funded research for its economic and military advancement.\n5. He took out Iran\u2019s terrorist Quds force leader Qasem Soleimani. Trump drew a red line, warning Tehran that if it killed even one American, he would respond militarily \u2014 and then\u00a0enforced it. His Soleimani strike eliminated the mastermind of Iran\u2019s proxy wars across the Middle East and restored deterrence with Tehran.\n4. He put Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court. The last president to appoint at least three justices in his first term was Richard M. Nixon. Barrett\u2019s confirmation secured a decisive 6-to-3 conservative majority that will affect the court\u2019s jurisprudence for a generation, with far-reaching consequences for life, religious liberty, free speech, Second Amendment rights, the separation of powers and limited government. Trump has secured his legacy as the most important president in the modern era when it comes to shaping the judiciary.\n3. He transformed the Middle East with the Abraham Accords. Trump brokered\u00a0not one, not two, not\u00a0three, but\u00a0four\u00a0Arab-Israeli peace accords\u00a0\u2014 the first agreements in more than a quarter-century. He did it by rejecting the failed conventional wisdom of the foreign policy establishment, which said that there could be no separate peace without the Palestinians, that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and confronting Iran\u2019s aggression would inflame the region and put peace out of reach. It did the opposite. The Abraham Accords are an achievement worthy of a Nobel Prize, and would rank No. 1 in a normal year. But two other Trump achievements eclipsed it.\n2. He averted a second Great Depression with the Cares Act.\u00a0When the pandemic began, economists warned that the US was\u00a0barreling\u00a0toward\u00a0a second Great Depression. The Cares Act not only saved us from that harrowing fate, but also helped businesses come roaring back from the spring lockdowns, producing record-breaking\u00a033.1 percent annualized GDP growth\u00a0in the third quarter. In March, the conventional wisdom was that it would take years for the economy to recover. Today, thanks to Trump\u2019s leadership, we are poised for a rapid recovery next year.\n1. He launched Operation Warp Speed, the greatest public health achievement in history.\u00a0Until now, the record for the fastest vaccine development was\u00a0four years. Operation Warp Speed did it in nine months. Because of Operation Warp Speed, the worst of the pandemic should be over by the spring. For all his mistakes in managing the pandemic, Trump is also responsible for ending it.\nIndividually, each of the last three items would rank among the greatest achievements of any president. Trump accomplished all three in a single year. So, despite giving us his worst list of worsts in 2020, he also gave us his best list of bests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMarc A.
