Brad Little questioned whether the law would withstand legal challenges.ByMary KekatosMarch 23, 2022, 9:02 PM2:48The Idaho House of Representative voted to approve a Texas-styled bill banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy by allowing potential family members to sue a doctor who performs one, on March 14, 2022, at the Statehouse in Boise, Idaho. The bill has already passed the Senate and now heads to Republican Gov. Brad Little's desk.Keith Ridler/APIdaho became the first U.S. state to enact a law modeled after the recent legislation passed in Texas that bans abortions after six weeks, before many women know they're pregnant.The new law also allows the father, grandparents, siblings, uncles or aunts of the fetus to sue a medical provider who performs the procedure.MORE: Idaho lawmakers pass 6-week abortion ban styled after Texas law The bill passed the state House of Representatives and Senate earlier this month and was signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday.Idaho Governor Brad Little speaks at the White House in Washington, July 16, 2020.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\"I stand in solidarity with all Idahoans who seek to protect the lives of preborn babies,\" Little wrote in a letter to Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, president of the state Senate.However, he expressed worries about whether the law is constitutional and whether it would stand challenges in court.\"While I support the pro-life policy in this legislation, I fear the novel civil enforcement mechanism will, in short order, be proven both unconstitutional and unwise,\" Little wrote.The law will go into effect, but opponents said they are already preparing to challenge the bill.One criticism is that prenatal scans often detect cardiac activity very early in pregnancies, but they're not heartbeats. They're signs of what will eventually become a heart.MORE: 2021 was pivotal year for abortion laws in AmericaAnother criticism is that family members can sue for a minimum of $20,000 within four years of an abortion. While a rapist wouldn't be allowed to sue, their family members could.Kim Clark, senior attorney at Legal Voice -- a non-profit organization advocating for the legal rights of women, girls and LGBTQ people in the Northwest -- said this could lead to women in abusive relationships being further harassed by their partners.\"This essentially makes the state complicit in intimate partner violence,\" Clark told ABC News in an interview last week. \"Allowing a member of the person's family to bring a claim, that could include an abuser where the survivor hasn't reported the assault.\"The Idaho House of Representative voted to approve a Texas-styled bill banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy by allowing potential family members to sue a doctor who performs one, on March 14, 2022, at the Statehouse in Boise, Idaho. The bill has already passed the Senate and now heads to Republican Gov. Brad Little's desk.Keith Ridler/APAlthough the Idaho law is the first in the nation to be modeled after the Texas law, there are a few differences.Both allow for exceptions in the case of a medical emergency, but the Texas law does not allow for exceptions in cases of rape or incest. In contrast, the Idaho bill does allow for such exceptions.However, women who want an abortion under those exceptions in Idaho are required to file a police report and show it to the medical provider before the abortion.Another difference between the two pieces of legislation is that the Idaho bill only allows for certain family members of the fetus to sue the medical provider who performed the abortion, but the Texas law allows almost any private citizen to sue any Texas doctor who performs an abortion, intends to perform an abortion or helps a woman receive an abortion.Related TopicsAbortion RightsTop StoriesJudge rules evidence related to 'Access Hollywood' tape admissible in Trump trialMar 18, 10:35 PMState Medicaid offices target dead people\u2019s homes to recoup their health care costsMar 16, 8:18 PMTrump claims Liz Cheney and Jan. 6 committee should be jailedMar 19, 12:58 AMTrump faces 'insurmountable difficulties' in securing $464M bond in civil fraud caseMar 18, 2:47 PMTimeline of college student's disappearance after night out in Nashville3 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights \u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n\n\n"
