Scroll the Twitter feed of the movement\u2019s darling, Live Action founder Lila Rose, and you\u2019ll find as many recent posts about the sexualization of children as you will see missives that are singularly about abortion. Take a gander at the feed of Students for Life, and you\u2019ll find people calling Planned Parenthood staff \u201cgroomers.\u201d Turn the television channel to EWTN, a staunchly anti-abortion Catholic network and the largest religious broadcast in the world, and you\u2019ll find hosts decrying Disney\u2019s \u201ctransgender grooming\u201d of kids. The alarm couldn\u2019t appear more disingenuous. In recent weeks, anti-abortion activists loudly condemned luxury designer Balenciaga\u2019s revolting ad showing children carrying teddy bears in bondage wear\u2014Abby Johnson even used the occasion to promote the \u201cCulture of Life\u201d fashion brand\u2014but stayed mum on news of far wider-reaching scandals.* Among them: The Maryland attorney general has found that more than six hundred people were abused in the Archdiocese of Baltimore, which is now suing to keep court documents sealed. Pope John Paul II seems to have shuffled around abusive priests before assuming St. Peter\u2019s throne. And, claiming to be performing an exorcism, an already-sentenced priest at the \u201ctradCath\u201d Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio repeatedly raped a young woman, eventually impregnating her, blaming a demon, and forcing her to obtain an abortion. Both laity and high-ranking clerics helped cover it up, some even participating by holding the victim down. Critics could point to the high-profile Rose\u2019s silence on hypersexualization within Christian purity culture as further evidence of her apathy\u2014especially as this culture is arguably the most pornographic one that many will ever experience. Girls are made to pledge their virginity to their fathers, wear a ring to symbolize the covenant, and even attend \u201cpurity balls\u201d with dear old Dad. They\u2019re coaxed to identify with child saints who allegedly died protecting their hymens from evil non-Christians, and they\u2019re threatened that if they have premarital sex, no one will ever want to marry them, as they\u2019ll be as worthless as a chewed stick of gum. They\u2019re explicitly told their body is \u201cnot their own,\u201d often leading to rape. Many develop anorexia nervosa, as they\u2019re so desperate to desexualize their bodies.Because Rose and her ilk\u2014mostly white women\u2014seem so very unserious about eradicating the grooming and sexual abuse of children and young women, it may be tempting to consign them to the \u201cQAnon\u201d corner of the right-wing fever swamp. But that would be a mistake, as these figures are actually legitimating the antisemitic conspiracies that animate the deranged devotees of Q. In their crusade against abortion, they are synonymizing Judaism and \u201cbaby murder.\u201d As hate crimes against Jews climb, and as Jewish groups continue to challenge abortion restrictions on religious grounds, it\u2019s crucial to understand this hideous project.Antisemitism, it must be noted, has always been a part of the anti-abortion movement. For decades, there have been pervasive myths that Margaret Sanger was Jewish, biblical Jews sacrificed their children to the Canaanite deity Moloch, and the majority of abortion doctors are Jewish. \u201cPro-life\u201d terrorists have disproportionately targeted Jewish doctors for murder and flooded abortion clinics with hate mail calling, for instance, for Jewish doctors to be lynched and for there to be \u201canother Hitler.\u201dIn 2008, the infamous Holocaust denier Michael A. Hoffman published a book, Judaism Discovered: From Its Own Texts, which called abortion a Jewish \u201cfamily value.\u201d That same year, E. Michael Jones published The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit, in which he blamed Jews for Roe v. Wade. In 2019, the fundamentalist Christian station TruNews aired a two-part segment on the \u201cJewish contribution\u201d to Roe, calling abortion \u201cthe real Jewish Holocaust\u201d and echoing Jones\u2019s claim that infant killing is \u201cJewish theology.\u201d  Such comments have their roots in the \u201cblood libel,\u201d the centuries-old canard that Jews prey upon Christian youth and then use their blood in a ritual reenactment of their crucifixion of Christ. The fact that the Roman Empire executed Jesus never stopped European Christians from putting Jews in ghettos and trying to systematically slaughter in the name of the children. Likewise, the fact that Jews do not actually control the abortion industry has not stopped today\u2019s bigots from calling for Jews to be \u201chunted down and \u2026 executed in the town square\u201d for their \u201cdiabolical shit\u201d against the unborn. It\u2019s precisely this legacy of racial terror that Rose invokes every time she refers to abortion as a \u201csatanic ritual\u201d and when she retweets a photograph of a bloody-handed model bogusly alleged to be the designer behind the Balenciaga campaign. Anti-abortion political correspondent Edie Heipel is doing much the same when she calls abortion \u201ca sacrament,\u201d yoking it, as Rose has repeatedly done, to pedophilia and transgender care.\u201cIt is now fairly common to hear pro-lifers talk about abortion as a religious rite,\u201d as well as for them to blur it with other tales of their enemies perverting children, David W. Lafferty, an independent Catholic scholar, told The New Republic. \u201cThey may attribute these crimes to liberals or globalists or Satanists or Freemasons, but the historical roots of this kind of rhetoric are in Christian antisemitism.\u201dLafferty notes that many do not know they\u2019ve adopted narratives with anti-Jewish tropes. The tragic fact is the Catholic Church has sanctioned the hate of Jews for so long that it\u2019s become embedded in the language and structures of thought. Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, scholar in residence at the National Council of Jewish Women, or NCJW, added in a separate interview with The New Republic that antisemitism works best \u201cin the background\u201d\u2014that is, when people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re spreading it. But surely Rose knows what she is doing, right? Her social media posts so often provoke blatantly antisemitic comments, and she does not appear to care. If she names Jews at all, it is only to subordinate their suffering under the Third Reich to abortion, as others have done before her. In her mind, it\u2019s Planned Parenthood that is \u201cthe most genocidal corporation in human history.\u201dFor Ruttenberg, such \u201cappropriation of atrocity\u201d has become a clich\u00e9 in white Christian society. Just as Gentiles once transformed a persecuted Jew into a Christian persecuted by Jews, white Christians today endlessly seize upon the suffering of others to portray themselves as the true victims of history. This is part and parcel of supersessionist theology, which casts Judaism as a mere prelude to the bigger, better religion. So, too, is the tendency of Christians to speak for Jews, which seems to be happening with even greater frequency in wake of Roe\u2019s fall. In September, the popular Catholic priest and podcaster Father Mike Schmitz was quoted in The New York Times saying that the \u201cJudeo-Christian position for millenniums has been that the rights of [the unborn] are the same as the rights of the mom.\u201d\u201cLeave the Jews out of it,\u201d tweeted one disgusted psychiatrist, citing work by Ruttenberg and others on the primacy of the pregnant person\u2019s life and welfare in the Jewish tradition, even in orthodox circles. Several others added that Schmitz wasn\u2019t even entirely correct about Christian tradition, noting how Church leaders once permitted herbs to \u201cbring on late periods\u201d and only recently pegged ensoulment to conception.Embedded in Schmitz\u2019s statement is the notion that Jews who support abortion are not real Jews. This logic is sure to proliferate, as Jewish groups organize to challenge state restrictions on abortion. In Indiana, a judge recently blocked an abortion ban that was challenged by Jewish, Muslims, and other groups on religious liberty grounds. In the Ninth Circuit Appellate Court, the NCJW just won an injunction against an Arizona fetal personhood law. According to Ruttenberg, the organization has filed an amicus brief in Kentucky, where abortion providers have sued the state, and is considering leading amicus briefs in other states with comparable suits.It may be that Catholic anti-abortion activists perceive the need to tap into ancient hate because everything is now riding on these suits and their Church has offered, in Lafferty\u2019s words, \u201cprecious little guidance on how to actually be pro-life in a pluralistic society.\u201d While Pope Francis has signaled the need for a more conciliatory approach\u2014one that takes seriously the differing beliefs of others on such matters as ensoulment or personhood\u2014U.S. bishops have either tended to ignore or condemn those who disagree with them. Consequently, Catholic moral thought on abortion has been totally transmogrified by racism and other destructive forces, and anti-abortion activists have, on the whole, done next to nothing to build a culture of life from the ground up. Lafferty adds that while activists have long positioned themselves as fighting against \u201ca legal and medical regime,\u201d their touted alternative is exactly that. \u201cThe amount of control and surveillance that they would place upon women is remarkable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is never a thought given to the idea of leaving law out of it for the time being and simply working to reduce abortion rates by campaigning for pro-women and pro-family social policy.\u201d (Black Catholics, whom the anti-abortion movement has long sent running for the hills, have argued the same, adding that the state is never colorblind when surveilling its citizens.)So long as abortion remains legal, there can be little doubt that Rose and friends will continue to fearmonger about children being groomed and trafficked in the most devilish ways. And as long as the anti-abortion movement persists with this rhetoric, Jewish lives will be among those that are increasingly endangered. The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitic violence, has already predicted this year will resemble the last, in that it will feature the highest number of such reported incidents on record. Some say it\u2019s only a matter of time before Ye discovers his affinities with the Church and converts. (The artist formerly known as Kanye West recently called abortion \u201cgenocide\u201d and implored the Jewish people to \u201cforgive Hitler.\u201d)Nevertheless, many are hopeful. \u201cThe tide is turning,\u201d Ruttenberg says of the white supremacist Christian establishment. \u201cPower is slipping away; they\u2019re just trying to hold on.\u201d She points toward the significant turnout of Black voters for the reelection of the Reverend Dr. Senator Raphael Warnock despite massive voter suppression, along with the \u201csolidarity work\u201d that she\u2019s seeing in such programs as the NCJW-sponsored Jews for Abortion Access. \u201cWhite Jews are coming back to the understanding that white supremacy is the enemy,\u201d much as in the civil rights era, when, having not yet assimilated into whiteness, their press readily called lynch mobs \u201cpogroms.\u201d With headlines on increasing rates of maternal mortality, particularly within the Black community, and other pregnancy-related atrocities, Americans are also beginning to understand that abortion access really is a \u201cracial justice issue, a disability rights issue, an economic issue,\u201d and so on, says Ruttenberg. \u201cIt might take 10, 50, 70 years, and there will be pain and suffering in the meantime, but we will get there.\u201d As for the white women who\u2019ve made money and fame on hate\u2014it seems they\u2019ll have to find a new grift. * This article originally mischaracterized the Balenciaga ad.Audrey Clare Farley @AudreyCFarleyAudrey Clare Farley is the author of The Unfit Heiress and Girls and Their Monsters.
