Janet Mills and legislative leaders want to expand access to abortion \u2014 allowing abortions after 24 weeks with a doctor\u2019s approval \u2014 and take steps to protect health care providers.\nOne of the bills would allow abortion access anytime before birth if deemed necessary by a medical provider. Current state law bans abortions after a fetus becomes viable outside the womb, at roughly 24 weeks.\nMills, a Democrat, cited the case of a Yarmouth veterinarian, Dana Peirce, who was forced to travel to Colorado for an abortion because it was forbidden in Maine later in pregnancy. Peirce learned 32 weeks into her pregnancy that the fetus had a deadly form of skeletal dysplasia.\n\u201cThe decision to have an abortion is deeply personal and, as in Dana\u2019s case, can be heartbreaking. Fundamentally, these are decisions that should be made by a woman and her medical provider,\u201d Mills said.\nThe announcement by Mills, House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross and Senate President Troy Jackson \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 came days ahead of what would\u2019ve been the 50th anniversary of\u00a0Roe v. Wade,\u00a0which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned last June.\nThe lawmakers contended that one in three women across the country have lost access to safe, legal abortions since\u00a0states began banning the procedure.\nTalbot Ross said Maine is going to\u00a0protect abortion access\u00a0and health care providers, providing \u201ca shelter from the storm and a beacon of hope.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Biden effort to protect abortion access hindered by strict state laws\nSeveral other Democrat-backed proposals would address out-of-date data collection rules, strengthen protections for health care providers, and prevent municipalities from restricting abortions, they said.\nHouse Republicans issued a statement saying that the proposed changes were too extreme, and suggesting that Mainers are content with current law.\nThe policy director of the Christian Civic League of Maine questioned whether lawmakers should focus their attention on inflation and affordable housing instead of abortion, which he said is guaranteed to have an \u201cemotional tug.\u201d\nIn Maine, a Republican governor in 1993 signed a law affirming the right to abortion before a fetus is viable. Under current law, abortion is only allowed after that if the life or health of the person who is pregnant is at risk, or if the pregnancy is no longer viable.\nMills said she hasn\u2019t made a decision on whether Maine should put forward a constitutional amendment to enshrine the state law. She said the matter is currently under review by the attorney general.\nAbortions later in pregnancy are extremely rare in Maine. State data from 2019 indicates that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester of pregnancy. Nearly 70 percent happened before nine weeks and 92 percent of abortions are performed by the 12th week, according to the statistics.\nIn Peirce\u2019s case, she said she was shocked to learn during a routine ultrasound that her son \u2014 who she\u2019d already named Cameron \u2014 had a deadly condition and was suffering in the womb from a broken bone and other problems. If he\u2019d survived birth, he would\u2019ve been unable to breathe, she said.\nPeirce told The Associated Press that no one should have to go through such a painful experience \u2014 one that was made worse because she and her husband had to leave their young daughter behind in order to travel to another state for a procedure that was medically recommended in her home state.\n\u201cThis was a really sad thing to happen. We did our best. I\u2019m doing my best now to change it for other people,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Debbie Jeffreys of Metairie, Louisiana, holds a sign during nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v.
