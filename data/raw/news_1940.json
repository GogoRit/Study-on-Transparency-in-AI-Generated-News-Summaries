Wade last year. Since then, conservative states including Oklahoma have enforced restrictions on abortion. Oklahoma\u2019s top court ruled that a woman has the right under the state Constitution to receive an abortion to preserve her life if her doctor determines that continuing the pregnancy would endanger it due to a condition she has or is likely to develop during the pregnancy. Previously, the right to an abortion could only take place in the case of medical emergency. \u201cRequiring one to wait until there is a medical emergency would further endanger the life of the pregnant woman and does not serve a compelling state interest,\u201d the ruling states.\n\nIn the 5-4 ruling, the court said the state law uses both the words \u201cpreserve\u201d and \u201csave\u201d the mother\u2019s life as an exception to the abortion ban. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe language \u2018except to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency\u2019 is much different from \u2018preserve her life,\u2019\u201d according to the ruling.\u201cAbsolute certainty,\u201d by the physician that the mother\u2019s life could be endangered, \u201cis not required, however, mere possibility or speculation is insufficient\u201d to determine that an abortion is needed to preserve the woman\u2019s life, according to the ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court, however, declined to rule on whether the state Constitution grants the right to an abortion for other reasons. The court ruled in the lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood, Tulsa Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic and others challenging the state laws passed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a nationwide right to abortion for nearly half a century. \n\nSince then, a patchwork of laws has meant some patients have had to travel to other states to get abortions when it was outlawed where they lived.\u201cThis ruling leaves out too many Oklahomans. Oklahomans shouldn\u2019t have to travel across state lines just to reach an abortion clinic, and it is heartbreaking that many will not be able to do so,\u201d said Dr. Alan Braid, an abortion provider and plaintiff in the case said in a statement. The ruling in Oklahoma is unlikely to mean abortion becomes widely available.In a lawsuit filed earlier this month over Texas\u2019 abortion ban, five women said they were denied abortions even when pregnancy endangered their lives. The suit claims the Texas law is creating confusion among doctors, who are turning away some pregnant women experiencing health complications because they fear repercussions.Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Great Plains called the ruling a small step toward restoring the right to abortion.\u201cThe Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized one fundamental truth: patients must be permitted to access critical care to save their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the right recognized today is so limited that most people who need abortion will not be able to access it.\u201d___Follow AP\u2019s full coverage of abortion: https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
