While the National Prayer Vigil for Life was taking place inside the National Shrine and people attended a Mass and prayed that people would recognize the God-given dignity of human life at all stages, the abortion rights supporters projected messages onto the Knights Tower in front of the basilica.\u00a0\n\u00a0Cardinal Gregory, who serves as the chair of the Board of Trustees for the National Shrine, said, \u201cThose whose antics projected words on the outside of the church building demonstrated by those pranks that they really are external to the Church.\u201d\nHere is the text of Cardinal Gregory\u2019s full statement issued on Jan. 21:\n\u201cThe true voice of the Church was only to be found within The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception last evening. There, people prayed and offered the Eucharist asking God to restore a true reverence for all human life. Those whose antics projected words on the outside of the church building demonstrated by those pranks that they really are external to the Church and they did so at night \u2013 John 13:30.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPriority Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail *\n\nSubmit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPriority Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail *\n\nSubmit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n Local\nUS & World\nFaith\nCulture\nJunior Saints\nCare for Creation\nSpecial Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoices\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogs\n\n\n \n        Everyday Faith\n      \n\n        From the ADW Archives\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n Contact Us\nArchdiocese of Washington \nCatholic Schools \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n Classifieds\nSubmit a Classified\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n Newsletter\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Catholic Standard\n\nSite by Glass Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
