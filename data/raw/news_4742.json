Pence's speech heralded the Trump administration's commitment to pro-life issues. [\u00a0DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  AP\u00a0]Published Aug. 7, 2020I grew up in a small town in Italy where abortion was illegal and could bring criminal charges. Yet in my hometown, everyone knew where to go for an abortion. There was a provider for poor women and a provider for the well-to-do. Most of the time, authorities in this mostly Catholic country left both alone.The situation is far different in America a half century later. In 2016, millions of Catholics and evangelicals whose voting choice is informed by a single issue \u2014 abortion \u2014 cast ballots for the current occupant of the White House. Whether Donald Trump ever endorsed abortion (or paid for his girlfriends\u2019 abortions in the past) was of no consequence to them. What mattered was his implied promise to appoint justices to the U.S. Supreme Court such that, one day soon, Roe v. Wade would be overturned, and abortion could again be a crime.Dr. Lodovico Balducci [\u00a0PHOTO PROVIDED BY MOFFIT  |  Tampa Tribune\u00a0]I share with those voters the motivation to see pro-life candidates elected to public office. Abortion is the issue that most influences my political choices.And yet I cannot possibly endorse the letter that my friends, the \u201cpro-life Democrats,\u201d recently sent to Donald Trump\u2019s political rival, Joe Biden, asking him to disallow federal funds for abortion should he defeat Trump. While I adamantly oppose abortion, I cannot in good conscience work toward the elimination of abortions for the impoverished women who are entitled to them in cases of rape or incest or when the pregnant woman\u2019s life is endangered by disease, illness or injury.Let\u2019s look a little closer at both political parties\u2019 hypocrisies and blind spots when it comes to abortion. But first, let me explain where I\u2019m coming from as a Catholic and a physician. I believe in science. The same science that recommends face masks to slow the spread of COVID-19 and warns about climate change also tells me that life begins at conception. According to molecular biology, what we call \u201clife\u201d is the ongoing decompression of a unique file contained in the DNA of each individual, a process that starts with fertilization.The idea that abortion is merely a form of birth control offends me. It\u2019s like declaring that war is an effective means to prevent overpopulation.Which leads us to back to the political parties. Liberals who brook no divergence from the pro-choice point of view display the same disdain for life that Trump supporters showed when backing the action of ICE agents at our southern border ripping children, even nursing babies, from their parents\u2019 arms. The same disdain for life that young men bearing Confederate flags showed when they coughed on me as I pleaded with them to respect social distance.As for the GOP, unlike the Catholics and evangelicals who voted for Trump, I cannot overlook the cruelty and reflexive violence that informs the administration\u2019s domestic and foreign policy. Pro-life indeed! St. Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans is one of the texts most beloved by Christians who profess to believe in a God of love. In 2018 then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions invoked those passages to defend the breakup of immigrant families \u2014 this, as part of an administration that had no plan to reunite or even keep accurate lists of the names of those children.Spend your days with HayesSubscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletterColumnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.Loading...You\u2019re all signed\u00a0up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters\u00a0in\u00a0your\u00a0inbox? Let\u2019s\u00a0get\u00a0started.Explore all your optionsAnd how can the Republicans who currently run the country say that each child is welcome in this world, all while passing a tax cut for the rich as they gut programs in ways that keep Americans in abject poverty, uneducated and deprived of health coverage? When they dare to claim with straight faces that $600 a week in federal unemployment compensation is too high for a family of four \u2014 and now, even that has lapsed?Under our American brand of capitalism, human life has become a commercial good that can be disposed of when it ceases to serve the prevailing power. If you doubt that, look at the administration\u2019s willingness to sacrifice the lives of the poor, the front-line workers and the aged during this pandemic to \u201copen up the economy.\u201dThose who are keeping track have numbered Trump\u2019s lies or misleading claims at 20,000. One might wonder why his evangelical supporters cling to the belief that he will make good on his implied promise to end legal abortion. In my book, a web of lies is at odds with Christianity, with belief in a God who is the truth, the life and the way.But disgust for the current administration is not what fuels my position on federal funding of abortion for indigent women. Rather, I feel some guilt that social and economic conditions still exist that make abortion seem necessary. I feel that I don\u2019t have the right to tell a woman how to manage her pregnancy.I\u2019m realistic enough to know that abortion will not go away in America even if it becomes illegal, just as it never disappeared in the Italy of my youth. I wish that more Democratic candidates would show at least some empathy for people like me who abhor abortion instead of labeling us Neanderthals.But I have come to recognize that only policies inspired by compassion and justice will have a chance to succeed at making abortion obsolete. Sadly, I \u2014 unlike those Trump supporters willing to turn a blind eye \u2014 can\u2019t find those policies espoused by most prolife champions.Lodovico Balducci is an author and retired medical doctor living in Tampa.
