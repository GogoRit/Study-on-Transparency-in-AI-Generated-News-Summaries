The motion, proposed by Labour MP Dr Rupa Huq, passed with 213 votes to 47.\nCampaigners from Abortion Rights Scotland, Engender and Scottish Women\u2019s Aid, have criticised Cameron\u2019s vote last week, arguing that anti-abortion demonstrations have a directly harmful effect on women\u2019s mental health.\nCameron, a clinical psychologist and MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, spoke publicly about her pro-life views last July after voting against the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland, citing her Christianity.\nFollowing Cameron\u2019s vote last week, Jillian Merchant, of Abortion Rights Scotland, said: \u201cWe are appalled to learn that Dr Lisa Cameron MP voted against ending the harassment of women outside abortion clinics.\n\u201cGiven that this legislation, if passed, would not apply in Scotland, and that the SNP do not generally vote on \u2018English-only\u2019 issues, this not only calls into question Dr Cameron\u2019s priorities but also demonstrates the lengths she is willing to go, as a law-maker, to inflict her anti-choice views on other women.\n\u201cWomen should not have to run a gauntlet of protestors, be shouted at, have their decision-making questioned and be confronted with pictures of foetuses on their way to accessing routine healthcare.\u201d\nMerchant said the fact that the vote was submitted by the SNP\u2019s Chief Whip was particularly concerning, claiming this \u201ccalls into question the SNP\u2019s commitment to abortion rights\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cThe SNP, as well as Dr Cameron, should be held accountable for why they think it is acceptable for women to be harassed while accessing routine healthcare.\u201d\nThe Bill proposed by Huq follows issues in her own constituency, where Ealing Council became the first in the UK to introduce 100 metre buffer zones around abortion facilities in 2018, due to frequent protests by anti-abortion groups.\nSimilar protests have taken place in Scotland, although the issue is slightly different as abortions are typically provided in hospitals. There have been discussions in some Scottish local authorities around introducing buffer zones in response.\nAnti-abortion protests\nRuling on an unsuccessful appeal against the buffer zones in Ealing last year, a judge said demonstrations outside these facilities amount to \u201cuninvited attention\u201d when women are \u201cvulnerable and sensitive\u201d.\nScottish Women\u2019s Aid suggested that Cameron\u2019s opposition to the motion reflects a failure to understand the potential impacts of such protests on mental well-being, particularly for women who have experienced abuse.\nA spokeswoman for Scottish Women\u2019s Aid said: \u201cWe find it unfathomable that any politician would vote against this bill, but particularly a politician with a responsibility for mental health, when women have told us for decades about the impact that limiting access to reproductive rights has on their mental wellbeing.\n\u201cForced pregnancy and restricting access to abortion and health services can be tactics in an abuser\u2019s arsenal. For women who have had choice in their own lives restricted to be greeted with anti-choice sentiment, reinforcing the messages coming from their abuser about their choices and their worth, compounds harm.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUS Christian right \u2018dark money\u2019 backed anti-abortion Glasgow students\n\nFeminist policy group Engender also raised concerns about Cameron\u2019s vote against the motion.\nDirector of Engender, Emma Ritch, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s access to reproductive services, including abortion, is necessary to our physical and mental health. Women find protests at healthcare clinics to be threatening, distressing, and traumatising.\nRitch said that protests are a \u201cbarrier to safe and legal abortion\u201d adding they also cause \u201cprofound distress to women undergoing fertility treatments and accessing other sexual health services\u201d.\n\u201cProtests at healthcare services are designed to intimidate patients, some of whom will be experiencing the trauma of terminating a much-wanted pregnancy that may harm them, undergoing a natural miscarriage, or seeking treatment after being sexually assaulted,\u201d Ritch continued.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s mental health is best supported by slightly relocating loud and angry protests by those who believe they can make better decisions about women\u2019s bodies and lives than women can.\n\u201cWe would encourage anyone concerned with women\u2019s mental wellbeing to reflect on the impact that these protests have, and do all they can to remove them, along with other the barriers to accessing abortion.\u201d\nScottish Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said that women seeking to access reproductive health services \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to worry about avoiding demonstrations outside clinics\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely dispiriting that the SNP\u2019s mental health spokesperson doesn\u2019t recognise the impact such demonstrations could have on women\u2019s mental health,\u201d Johnstone added.\nResponding to criticisms, Dr Lisa Cameron MP said: \u201cPrior to coming into politics, I worked as a clinical psychologist in mental health for over 20 years and on no occasion did anyone ever call into question my suitability because I am a Christian with pro-life views.\nShe added: \u201cThis was entirely a conscience vote by proxy, submitted on my behalf by the SNP Chief Whip, and it was also commensurate with the parliamentary review that national buffer zones are not a proportionate response, as legislation already exists to restrict protest activities that cause harm to others.\u201d\nSpeaking ahead of the vote at Westminster last week, Dr Rupa Huq stressed that her motion was \u201cnot about the rights and wrongs of abortion\u201d and that \u201cmany MPs on both sides of the house who are supporting this bill are devout Christians\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cThis is about women being able to present themselves for legal healthcare free from intimidation.\u201d\nThe SNP did not respond to a request to clarify its position regarding Dr Cameron\u2019s vote, and the party\u2019s Chief Whip submitting the vote on her behalf.\nMore like this\n\n\nCatholic church told to shut down gay conversion therapy groups\n\n\nUniversity chaplain calls Pride a \u2018gross offence to God\u2019\n\n\nUS Christian right \u2018dark money\u2019 backed anti-abortion Glasgow students\n\n\n\nShareTweetSubscribe\n\n\n\nabortionDr Lisa CameronEngenderWestminster\n\n9 comments\n\n\n\n\n\nInga Bullen says: \n\nJune 30, 2020 at 1:43 pm \n\n\nThis SNP MP should not have voted for something that doesn\u2019t apply in Scotland. It appears her anti-abortion views are stronger than her party loyalty! This weakens SNP in Westminster. Glad the bill passed in spite of her vote.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nS Mills says: \n\nJune 30, 2020 at 6:17 pm \n\n\nHer party loyalty does not exist. I was in one of the local branches for this MP and she is an absolute disgrace. She\u2019s been responsible for hundreds of activists leaving the party.  She is in it for herself, and to push her own Christian, anti abortion, ultra right agenda under the guise of being an SNP MP. It\u2019s long past time she had the whip withdrawn.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nScott Watson says: \n\nJune 30, 2020 at 8:18 pm \n\n\nI\u2019ve now left the party and wont be back as long as she is the SNPs representative in ANY seat\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Watson says: \n\nJune 30, 2020 at 8:09 pm \n\n\nThis MP is an absolute disgrace, since her first month as an MP she has carried out a deliberate campaign to divide and sow discontent amongst the branches of her constituency.

She obviously appreciates the damage done to women\u2019s mential and physical health by abortion. (\u201cRoutine healthcare\u201d? How, as a lethal procedure, is an abortion caring for anyone\u2019s health?) Apparently she is getting terrible online abuse via this publication.  Please don\u2019t pretend you care about mental wellbeing, or that you are non-partisan!\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nScott Watson says: \n\nJune 30, 2020 at 8:58 pm \n\n\nweird how she can never produce screenshots of the abuse she apparently receives, besides, people voicing an opinion is not abuse and if she thinks it is she went into the wrong career. And if this site is partisan I would actually say it falls to the left so whats your point?\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanny says: \n\nJune 30, 2020 at 9:10 pm \n\n\nThe SNP has no religious links. There is no evidence that Dr Cameron was elected to promote her personal views. She was not employed as a Psychologist because of her personal views and would not have been able to express them by her employer. Religious beliefs are personal and should not be a determinant in any occupation but especially not politics. Her duty is to represent her constituents not herself. Can she produce evidence that the people she represents concur with her outdated and mean spirited views. It is a matter of supreme indifference what any MPs personal views are and they should remain personal. MPs need to remember that they are paid to be a conduit for their constituents and not there to be a source of personal prejudice. To go out of one\u2019s way to try to prevent vulnerable women being attacked doesn\u2019t seem very humane. I am disappointed that this issue continues to be raised by an SNP representative as part of an unsupported crusade. Please do your job and respect the views of your many constituents who emphatically disapprove of your damaging and irrelevant  religious agenda.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Conroy says: \n\nJuly 1, 2020 at 10:49 am \n\n\nThere is no evidence of harassment or intimidation outside abortion clinics. There have been no arrests, no criminality, no criminal proceedings. Peaceful vigils offer women real help and support which you seek to deny them. Dr Cameron should be applauded for her stance.\nAbortion is not \u2018healthcare\u2019 no matter how much you say it is because it always kills a human being and does untold physical and psychological damage to many women (see Dr Greg Pike\u2019s report \u201cAbortion and Women\u2019s Health\u201d).\nThe early feminist Alice Paul said \u201cabortion is the ultimate exploitation of women\u201d and indeed it is. Abortion kills a human being and hurts women. Women and their children deserve better than abortion.\nI\u2019ll leave you with this interesting quote from Erika Bachiochi\u2019s \u2018Embodied Equality\u2019 :\n\u201cAbortion rights actually hinder the equality of women by taking the wombless male body as normative, thereby promoting cultural hostility toward pregnancy and motherhood. Only prolife feminism can promote the equality of women because it does not embrace the falsehood that equality requires women to deny their fertility and reject their children.\u201d\nPs. I note you \u201cwelcome strong opinions and diverse perspectives\u201d but not, it would seem, if it is an opinion with which you disagree, as evidenced by this article!\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nSiobhan says: \n\nJuly 19, 2020 at 2:13 pm \n\n\nOf course you\u2019re a man. Come back here when a female member close to you gets told either she terminates the pregnancy or she\u2019ll die or when a female member close to you is abused and has to carry the abusers child or when shes told that if she has the baby it will never walk/talk/think for itself.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
