Ramazan\u2019s aunt died while getting an illegal abortion.\n\nCarla Ramazan\n\n\u201cI wanted to prevent that from ever happening to others,\u201d Ramazan said.\nHer passion and leadership in organizing students at UT\u00a0Dallas and elsewhere to advocate for reproductive rights has now been recognized with the distinguished Harry S. Truman Scholarship.\nA political science major in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences and a Eugene McDermott Scholar, Ramazan joins an elite group of 62 Truman Scholarship recipients from across the country this year.\nThe Truman Scholarship, which provides a $30,000 grant for graduate study, is awarded annually to a select group of college students interested in pursuing careers in public service.\nDr. Douglas Dow, associate dean of the Hobson Wildenthal Honors College and clinical professor of political science, said UT\u00a0Dallas has had a strong presence in the Truman Scholarship program, with two winners and six other finalists in the last 10 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that UT\u00a0Dallas is giving students who are interested in public service the kind of mentoring they need to get to the final round,\u201d Dow said.\nThe Truman application is one of the most difficult of all the distinguished scholarships, Dow said, because students need to show not only why they are committed to public service, but also provide details on how they have shown leadership by the time they\u2019re a junior in college.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being responsible and trying to do everything yourself, and being a leader who gets others to do what they would otherwise not have done. That\u2019s the Truman challenge, as I see it,\u201d Dow said.\nAs an Archer Fellow, Ramazan spent the fall 2019 semester in Washington, D.C., working in the campaign department for NARAL Pro-Choice America. She reached out to college campuses and provided resources for students to become active.\n\u201cIt was so great to see how many students are passionate about reproductive freedom,\u201d Ramazan said.\n\n\u201cCarla\u2019s passion for service to others, combined with her tremendous intellect and desire to achieve academic excellence, are the epitome of what this award stands for. Her activism, leadership and dedication are inspiring. I am excited to see her continue to grow as a young scholar and public servant in the coming years.\u201d\nDr. Denise Paquette Boots, associate dean of undergraduate education in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences\nOn campus, Ramazan organized a UT\u00a0Dallas chapter of Deeds Not Words, a statewide nonprofit organization founded by former state senator Wendy Davis to galvanize young women in advocating for access to reproductive health and freedom from sexual assault.\n\u201cI saw the need to have student groups at UT Dallas that were focused on women\u2019s issues,\u201d she said.\nAs a member of the UT\u00a0System Student Advisory Council, Ramazan presented to the Board of Regents the group\u2019s recommendations for free speech on campus.\n\nAbout Truman Scholars\nEach new Truman Scholar receives up to $30,000 for graduate study. Scholars also receive priority admission and supplemental financial aid at some premier graduate institutions, leadership training, career and graduate school counseling, and internship opportunities within the federal government. Recipients must be U.S. citizens, have outstanding leadership potential and communication skills, demonstrate academic excellence, and be committed to careers in government or the nonprofit sector.\n\nShe also served as vice president for Student Government, helped create a video on bystander intervention that targeted sexual harassment, participated in Model UN and was an officer in the campus chapter of No Labels, a political action coalition.\nDr. Denise Paquette Boots, associate dean of undergraduate education in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, praised Ramazan\u2019s activism and leadership in bringing awareness to issues such as gender equality, sexual violence and reproductive rights.\n\u201cCarla\u2019s passion for service to others, combined with her tremendous intellect and desire to achieve academic excellence, are the epitome of what this award stands for. Her activism, leadership and dedication are inspiring. I am excited to see her continue to grow as a young scholar and public servant in the coming years,\u201d said Boots, who is also a professor of public policy and political economy.\nRamazan plans to apply to law schools in the fall and will use her scholarship toward furthering her career goal of becoming an attorney and one day working for Planned Parenthood or the American Civil Liberties Union.\nRamazan is the third UT\u00a0Dallas student to receive the Truman Scholarship. Matthew Salm BS\u201918 won the scholarship in 2017, and Sophie Rutenbar BA\u201906 was a recipient in 2005. Both were also McDermott Scholars.\nRutenbar went on to earn master\u2019s degrees at King\u2019s College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science and now works with the United Nations.\nSalm went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in global affairs from Tsinghua University in Beijing, where he studied as a Schwarzman Scholar. He now works in Wisconsin as an investment analyst with The Milwaukee Company. Salm also uses sports as a vehicle to advocate for food policy changes needed to protect the planet. He is seeking to qualify as a speedskater for the U.S. Olympic team in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact: Robin Russell, UT Dallas, 972-883-4431, robin.russell@utdallas.edu, or the Office of Media Relations, UT\u00a0Dallas, (972) 883-2155, newscenter@utdallas.edu.\n\n\nTagged:\nEPPS Eugene McDermott Scholars Program Hobson Wildenthal Honors College \n\n\n\n\nMore  Students Stretch Horizons as Archer Fellows in Washington, D.C.\nUrann Fellow Mixes Many Talents as Poet, Musician, Med Student\nPresident Benson: Dr. King\u2019s Dream Starts with Each of Us\nConstruction Kicks Off for New Student Union, Esports Center\n2023: A Year of Monumental Moments at UTD\n \n\nTop Stories\n\nChess Team Opens New Year by Finishing Pan-Ams with Final 4 Berth\nResearchers\u2019 Approach May Protect Quantum Computers from Attacks\nWind Energy Center To Expand with New Headquarters, Resources\nResearchers Find More Complexity in Aging Brain\u2019s Memory Decline\nResearchers\u2019 Sweeping Discovery Shows How Kidney Cells Self-Renew\nUT Dallas Makes Significant Gains in Best U.S. College Rankings\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 800 W.
