The bill, as proposed,\u00a0would create a government-run database for pregnant people looking into abortions in Oklahoma.An\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0legislator has proposed a new bill that would create a database of people seeking abortions in the state.\u00a0Senate Bill 1167, titled the \u201cEvery Mother Matter Acts,\u201d or\u00a0EMMA, was filed by State Senator George Burns earlier this month. The bill, as proposed,\u00a0would create a government-run database for pregnant people looking into abortions in Oklahoma.The bill noted that a \"single toll-free telephone number\" would be established for any person seeking an abortion to call. Those calling the number must accept a\u00a0\u201cpre-abortion resource access assistance offer\" to then be connected with a \"care agent,\" but that person is legally not allowed to refer a patient to an abortion provider.\u00a0The pregnant person would then be assigned a \u201cunique identifying number\u201d in the database, and abortion providers would be required to keep the information for seven years.\"The legislation is aimed at ensuring that any woman seeking an abortion is given access to resources and programs she may not realize are available,\" Burns' office said in a statement. Burns \"said the goal is to give women the support they need to choose life, instead of abortion,\" the statement said.After being connected to a \"care agent,\" the person possibly seeking an abortion would instead be provided a no-cost \"assessment of eligibility\" and offer in obtaining support services such as \"housing, employment, childcare, health care, counseling, adoption services, financial assistance and more.\" Specifics surrounding the services, or how a person would qualify for such services, are not included in the bill.\u00a0Anyone who has worked\u00a0as or for an abortion provider within the last two years is disqualified from becoming a care agent. Care agents are also required to\u00a0undergo training to help identify human trafficking indicators and comply with state and federal privacy laws.\u201cMy ultimate goal is ending abortion altogether, and that fight continues,\u201d Burns said in the statement.\u00a0\u201cBut we must also do all we can as a state to help present compassionate options for those faced with unexpected pregnancies that promote the preservation and dignity of life for mothers and their babies.\u201dOklahoma House Minority Leader Emily Virgin, a Democrat\u00a0who has been in the legislature for more than a decade, told The Huffington Post that \u201cthe bills get more and more extreme,\u201d which she attributes, partly, to \u201cthe national landscape and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court.\"Kristin Ford, vice president of communications and research at NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Burns' proposed legislation is \u201ctruly off the deep end,\u201d Huff Post reported.\u00a0\"This bill is just so beyond the bounds of what any rational person would consider an appropriate role for politicians to play in people\u2019s personal lives and family decisions,\" Ford said.Burns' proposed bill comes as the Supreme Court reviews\u00a0Roe vs. Wade the landmark case that protects a pregnant person's right to choose to have an abortion.\u00a0Lawmakers in at least 29 states have already filed antiabortion legislation in their 2022 legislative session that would limit abortion access, according to a previously reported story in The Washington Post.Eleven anti-abortion bills were pre-filed before the legislative session began.\u00a0Related Stories\u00a0A Federal Judge\u00a0Issues a\u00a0Preliminary Injunction for\u00a0Texas SB\u00a08 Abortion Law\u00a0EU Doctor Said She Will Still Prescribe Abortion Pills to Women in TexasTexas Abortion Ban: Justice Department Vows to Protect Those Seeking Abortions, Explore Ways to Challenge Law\u00a0\u00a0Tags:oklahomapregnancyTrending on Inside EditionBlack History Could Be 'Erased' by Laws Like Florida's Stop WOKE Act, Professor Fighting to Overturn It Says1Black History Could Be 'Erased' by Laws Like Florida's Stop WOKE Act, Professor Fighting to Overturn It SaysHuman InterestComedian Paralyzed After Falling Through Skylight While on a Date Found Love and a New Outlook on Life2Comedian Paralyzed After Falling Through Skylight While on a Date Found Love and a New Outlook on LifeINSIDE EDITION InDepthLaken Riley's Friends and Family Gather to Remember Nursing Student Slain on University of Georgia Campus3Laken Riley's Friends and Family Gather to Remember Nursing Student Slain on University of Georgia CampusNewsCouple Gets Married in Delivery Room at Missouri Hospital as Bride Was in Labor4Couple Gets Married in Delivery Room at Missouri Hospital as Bride Was in LaborHuman InterestAlabama Teen Who Allegedly Pushed 6-Year-Old Into Fire to Be Tried as Adult: Prosecutors5Alabama Teen Who Allegedly Pushed 6-Year-Old Into Fire to Be Tried as Adult: ProsecutorsCrimeOpens a new windowOpens a new windowOpens a new windowOpens a new windowOpens a new windowAbout UsAbout Inside EditionMeet the TeamAwardsContactConnectFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeRSSWatch Inside EditionLocal ListingsWatch Live StreamSites We LoveParamount+CBS NewsEntertainment TonightThe Drew Barrymore ShowRachael Ray ShowDABLLast.fmMixibleTerms of Use | Privacy Policy | Closed Captioning | California Notice | Do Not Sell My Personal Information\u2122 King World Productions Inc. \u00a9 2024 Inside Edition Inc. and CBS interactive Inc., Paramount companies.
