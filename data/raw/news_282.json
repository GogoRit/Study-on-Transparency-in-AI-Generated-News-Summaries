CSby Carter ShermanMarch 10, 2020, 6:57pmShareTweetSnapA Utah bill that aims to ban abortion could also make it a felony, punishable with prison time, for a woman to do her own procedure at home.The legislation would outlaw almost all abortions in Utah only if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. But if that happens, somebody who tries to administer an abortion, including their own, would be charged with a second-degree felony and could get sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined up to $10,000, Sen. Daniel McCay, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said in a state House committee hearing Monday.Advertisement\u201cSo if she did go seek medical help, she would be guilty of a second-degree felony?\u201d asked Rep. Marsha Judkins, a Republican.\u201cPotentially, yes,\u201d said McCay, who\u2019s also a Republican. McCay also pointed out that illegal abortions are already a second-degree felony in Utah.While reliable statistics on people who induce their own abortions \u2014 or \u201cself-manage\u201d their abortions, as abortion rights advocates call it \u2014 is hard to come by, there is some evidence that the number of these abortions will rise as restrictions force clinics to close. (It can be safe to end a pregnancy without enlisting a provider\u2019s direct supervision: The World Health Organization has designed a protocol, involving a drug called misoprostol, for people who are less than 12 weeks into pregnancy, which some abortion rights activists support.)In a January study, researchers from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project found that almost 7% of Texan patients had tried to induce abortions on their own. In interviews with 18 women who\u2019d done so, the researchers reported that the women were mostly motivated by their lack of access to money, transportation, and clinics.Earlier in the House hearing, Republican Rep. Ray Ward, a doctor, wanted to know how McCay\u2019s bill would address the possibility that more American women would die from unsafe abortions.\u201cWomen die in pregnancy from unsafe abortions in countries that have this policy,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI worry that if we were to have this be our policy, that we would see a rise in maternal deaths from unsafe abortion.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cNone of those that have a similar policy to this have the advanced social services that we have as a country,\u201d McCay replied, adding that Utah and the United States also have improved care for newborn children and mothers after birth.But Ward had a follow-up question: \u201cIf a woman were to try to do an unsafe abortion \u2014 her or a friend \u2014 with some implement, and she got an infection or punctured the uterus, which one of our social services do you think would make that not create a potentially life-threatening complication for her?\u201dMcCay said it depends on the woman\u2019s income level and proximity to medical care. He continued, \u201cI\u2019m trying to balance the life that\u2019s been lost in utero and at the same time I\u2019m trying to balance those two concerns.\u201dThe Utah bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate in late February \u2014 despite a last-minute attempt by a legislator to tack on an amendment that would essentially ban masturbation \u2014 and was voted out of the House committee on Monday. It will now head to a floor vote. If enacted, it would only allow people to undergo abortions if they or their fetus faced a medical emergency, or in cases of rape or incest.Eight states have already enacted measures known as called \u201ctrigger laws,\u201d which would immediately outlaw all or almost all abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion restrictions. Nine states also have abortion bans on the books from the days before Roe v. Wade.On Monday, a Utah state Senate committee also voted to advance a bill that will require people who want abortions to undergo ultrasounds. Over the last 10 years, states have passed more than 500 measures to limit abortion.Cover: In this May 21, 2019, file photo, activists gather in the Utah State Capitol Rotunda to protest abortion bans happening in Utah and around the country, in Salt Lake City.
