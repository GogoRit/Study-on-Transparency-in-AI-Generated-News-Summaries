(Courtesy of Zeta Barton)WASHINGTON (WSET)  \u2014 Pro-life supporters gathered for the 49th annual March for Life in Washington D.C. Friday. Among them were hundreds of Liberty University students.  Brother and sister duo,  Emily and Luke Chavez, are students who attended the March. They want the pro-life message they're sharing to reach the country and the world. \"I'm hoping not just by the numbers though, but by the people being here and fighting with the same passion and the same values, with the same message that we can make an impact,\" Emily Chavez said.

The Standing for Freedom Center at LU sponsored the students' trip. Christian Lasval, an administrator with Standing for Freedom Center, said more than 500 LU students attended the March.  That includes students from multiple clubs on campus.Lasval said the students' support for the unborn is driven by their faith.\"Their willingness to participate in things like this, it shows how much it truly matters to them. It's more than just words that they might say or type out for a social media post. They're willing to put, literally, feet on the ground to support these causes,\" Lasval said. After the rally, Lasval said they then marched to the steps of the Supreme Court where they prayed.He said he hopes the march will not only help change abortion laws but also change hearts and minds. \"At the end of the day, that's what we want to see most of. Because you can win a majority and change the law which is good, I'm not saying that would be a bad thing,   but it's even better when you have a national cohesion behind something,\" Lasval said.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, reviewing the constitutionality of a Mississippi state law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. He hopes this could be the last March for Life under the court standard of Roe v. Wade\"It's the 49th March for Life, so next year will be the big 50 and it would be wonderful to ring in that bicentennial with the post-Roe America,\" Lasval said.
