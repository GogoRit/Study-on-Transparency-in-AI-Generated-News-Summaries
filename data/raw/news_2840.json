Angie Santos, Gauri Raje, Malaki Lingg, and Riley CarrollApril 12, 2022Trigger Warning: Mention of abortion, rape, incest and death.\nUTSA\u2019s chapter of Students for Life hosted Kristan Hawkins, pro-life activist and founder of Students for Life of America, in the H-E-B Student Union on April 7. Alongside Hawkins\u2019 supporters, the event was also attended by pro-choice students, who protested with handmade signs.\u00a0\nDuring the event, Hawkins touched on several points dealing with abortion to argue for the pro-life movement. Hawkins\u2019 statements were met with applause from pro-life students as well as verbal disagreement from pro-choice students.\u00a0\nFollowing Hawkins\u2019 speech, the floor was opened up for questions. Both sides had the opportunity to engage with Hawkins, and several pro-choice students were quick to challenge Hawkins on a number of issues, ranging from when life begins to rape cases.\nKaylar Edwards, one of the several student protestors at the event, explained that the intention of speakers like Hawkins is not to make an argument on behalf of the pro-life movement, but to \u201cintimidate\u201d women.\nStudents hold up pro-choice posters as a sign of protest as Kristan Hawkins delivers her speech. (Riley Carroll)\n\u201c\u2026 these people [pro-life campaingers] don\u2019t really come here to try and change anybody\u2019s mind. Their purpose and tactic is to intimidate and try [to] make women uncomfortable and we\u2019ve seen that on so many different occasions, so any chance I have to try and match that energy and just give it back to them, I\u2019m gonna do that,\u201d Edwards said.\nDarby Dugger, another pro-choice student who was at the event and challenged Hawkins\u2019 views on abortions in the context of rape, explained that being pro-choice is not synonymous with being pro-abortion.\n\u201cI also think being pro-choice, as many of us have stated, does not mean we\u2019re pro-abortion \u2026 having a speaker like her come up and completely defame pro-choice as pro-abortion is invalid because it is not the same. Just because I\u2019m pro-choice does not mean I am pro-abortion,\u201d Dugger said.\nAnother pro-choice student, Emily Tilson, also touched on abortion as it relates to victims of rape.\u00a0\n\u201cI feel like, at the core of it, people don\u2019t understand all of the nuances of the argument of people who have been raped or people who have been in these situations where they can carry their pregnancy \u2026 but it\u2019s just crazy that we\u2019re still having this argument. I want to end it \u2014 I want to end the argument,\u201d Tilson said.\nOn the other hand, anti-abortion student Amir Hooper gave input on the event and its occurrences.\n\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think society will be able to progress unless we have these types of events \u2026 it\u2019s inevitable for people to have different opinions. And the thing is, we have to coexist, and we have to live with each other \u2026 there\u2019s no way around it,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cI\u2019m against abortion, but some things I don\u2019t even agree with. You know, I mean, like for example, the rape and incest thing. Morally, they should not have to deal with the baby.\u201d\nGalaxy Acton, the President of the UTSA Students for Life chapter, explained the process of arranging the event. Acton simply filled out a form on Hawkins\u2019 Instagram page regarding her tour across the southern parts of the U.S. and was later confirmed to host an event at UTSA.\u00a0\n\u201cI think having her was a great opportunity and it was always a goal of the group. So it was very exciting for them to accept our invitation and for them to come to our college campus and spread this message,\u201d Acton said.\nPresident of Students for Life, Kristan Hawkins, further explained her stance as a pro-life activist by claiming that the back alley abortion is a myth and nobody likes to confront the reality of abortion and its impact.\n\u201cI actually talked about the myth of the back alley abortion \u2026 showing that the back alley abortion is a myth.\u201d Hawkins emphasized, along with stating in her speech that during her visit to Texas, she saw no abortions performed in back alleys.\nHowever, studies by the World Health Organization offered a different stance, stating that \u201c\u2026when people with unintended pregnancies face barriers to attaining safe, timely, affordable, geographically reachable, respectful and non-discriminatory abortion, they often resort to unsafe abortion.\u201d\nAdditionally, their statistics showed that \u201ceach year, 4.7\u201313.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion. In developed regions, it is estimated that 30 women die for every 100,000 unsafe abortions. In developing regions, that number rises to 220 deaths per 100,000 unsafe abortions.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think people don\u2019t want to see the reality of abortion. Because when you see the reality of abortion, it\u2019s easy to say euphemisms like \u2018my body my choice\u2019 and all these things. But if abortions were conducted in the open, I actually believe nobody would be for abortion. But because that happens behind closed doors because we don\u2019t even like to say the word,\u201d Hawkins continued. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say I\u2019m anti-abortion. But why can\u2019t someone who supports abortion say that they\u2019re pro-abortion? Because instinctively in our gut \u2014 our heart \u2014 we kind of know there\u2019s something wrong with it, but if we do say there\u2019s something wrong, we may have to reconsider some of the actions we\u2019ve taken in our life or maybe some of the actions we\u2019re [currently] taking.\u201d\nabortion rightsnewspro lifepro-choiceStudents for Life \n\n\t\t\tLeave a Comment\t\t\nAbout the Contributors\n\nAngie Santos, Assistant News EditorAngie is a first-year student at UTSA.
