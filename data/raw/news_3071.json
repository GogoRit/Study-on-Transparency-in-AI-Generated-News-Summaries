Are you worried about how you\u2019ll be able to stay true to your pro-life values in fields which are rampant with pro-abortion bias? Have no fear; that\u2019s why Students for Life of America is here. Check out how we\u2019re mentoring and training our young medical and legal professionals below.\u00a0\nThis year, Students for Life of America (SFLA) brought ten medical and law students out to the National Pro-Life March and the National Pro-Life Summit as part of the new Mildred Jefferson Medical & Law Fellowship. These students came from across the nation to be trained by pro-life medical and legal professionals on how to succeed in their professional fields while also respecting their pro-life beliefs. They had the opportunity to interact with doctors from American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG) and lawyers from Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) and Charitable Allies. According to the students, the opportunity to connect with these pro-life professionals was invaluable. \u00a0\n\nStephen Reen, a law student at\u00a0Indiana University McKinney Law stated, \u201cThe Mildred Jefferson Law Fellowship gave me an incredible opportunity to connect with the advocates and practitioners at the heart of our critical movement. Any law student wishing to gain resources, practical guidance, and confidence as a pro-life advocate will find this Fellowship invaluable. I certainly did!\u201d\u00a0\nGavin Oxley, a pre-medical student at the University of Virginia, said, \u201cAs part of the Mildred Jefferson Medical Fellowship, the opportunity to attend the National Pro-Life Summit events greeted me with some of my first interactions with what it looks like to live out the pro-life movement as a medical professional and inspired me to know that perseverance of convictions and truth can be a reality in the field.\u201d\u00a0\nTruth should be a reality in the field, and that is why SFLA believes it is so important to invest in the futures of both the legal and medical fields. We recognize that it has become increasingly difficult for students entering these professions to honor their consciences in their work, and we want to make sure that they are supported as they support life. \u00a0\n\nWith these priorities in mind, SFLA\u00a0created the Mildred Jefferson Medical and Law Fellowship. This fellowship is open to all students who are entering the medical/law field\u2014and if that\u2019s you, you won\u2019t want to miss out on a fellowship like this. You\u2019ll gain knowledge, experience, confidence, and a powerful network of nationwide peer support. \u00a0\nApply HERE for the Mildred Jefferson Med and Law Fellowship which includes a kickoff weekend at the National Leaders Collective and optional mentorship for the upcoming year. Applications are due by March 31, 2022\u2014and we look forward to seeing yours!\u00a0\nIf you are a medical student interested in how to respect your pro-life beliefs going into your field, sign up to be a part of the Advocacy for Life Course, click HERE.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,254\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
