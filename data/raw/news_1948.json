Tony Evers and Democratic lawmakers announced a bill Tuesday that would repeal Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban to effectively \u201crestore Roe\u201d in the state.\u00a0\nThe action comes two weeks before Wisconsin\u2019s consequential Supreme Court Election. It follows Republicans\u2019 announcement of a bill last week that would add rape and incest exceptions during the first trimester of pregnancy to the current abortion ban and clarify Wisconsin\u2019s current \u201clife of the mother\u201d exception. Evers immediately rejected the GOP bill last week and recommitted to vetoing it, if necessary.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear from the beginning that I won\u2019t sign a bill that leaves Wisconsin women with fewer rights and freedoms than they had before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe,\u201d Evers said at the Tuesday press conference. \u201cSimply put, the Republicans\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Republican bill was also rejected by the Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), saying further discussion wasn\u2019t necessary and it wouldn\u2019t be considered on the floor of the Senate.\u00a0\nDemocrats\u2019 bill would repeal the 1849 law, which holds that any person \u2014 except the mother \u2014 who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child could be found guilty of a felony. The law\u2019s only exception is when a \u201ctherapeutic abortion\u201d is performed by a physician to \u201csave the life of the mother.\u201d\u00a0\nThe bill would leave in place other abortion regulations in Wisconsin, many of which were passed following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Experts say these laws \u2014 which include policies like requirements that physicians rather than nurses or midwives perform abortions, parental consent requirements for minors, the requirement that patients receive state-mandated informations and a ban on abortions after 20 weeks \u2014 have limited access to abortion in Wisconsin for years.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about fringe ideas here. What this bill will do is simple. It\u2019ll restore access to safe, legal abortion in Wisconsin to what it was on June 23, 2022\u2014nothing more, and nothing less,\u201d Evers continued.\u00a0\nEvers and Democrats first called for the repeal of the 1849 ban in June 2022 right before the announcement of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision. Republicans gaveled in and gaveled out of the special session Evers called to consider the repeal without any discussion.\u00a0\nThe resurrected bill \u2014 co-authored by Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) \u2014 is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Legislature this time around.\u00a0\n\u201cWomen\u2014not politicians\u2014are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies, lives, and health,\u201d Roys said. \u201cAbortion is common, safe, and not controversial. Wisconsinites overwhelmingly want to see the rights we had under Roe v. Wade restored.\u201d\nA majority of Wisconsinites support broader access to abortion, according to polls conducted by Marquette University Law School. In a November poll, 55% of people said they opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and 84% of people said Wisconsin should allow a woman to obtain a legal abortion who becomes pregnant as the result of rape or incest.\u00a0\n\u201cAs long as doctors face the threat of prosecution for providing basic reproductive healthcare, and as long as extremist Republicans continue putting politics ahead of our rights, patients will not have access to the abortion care they need in our state,\u201d Subeck said.\u00a0\nIn introducing the bill, Democrats are continuing to keep abortion in the spotlight, especially ahead of the April 4 election, which has increasingly become a referendum on abortion in the state. Republicans blocked an attempt by Democrats in January to put an advisory referendum on the April ballot asking voters whether Wisconsin should repeal the state\u2019s criminal abortion ban.\nThe state Supreme Court election \u2014 with conservative former Justice Dan Kelly facing liberal Judge Janet Protaciewitcz \u2014 could have massive impacts on future shape of abortion law in Wisconsin, especially with a case filed by Attorney General Josh Kaul moving through the judicial system that asks for clarity on state abortion law by declaring the 1849 ban unenforceable due to its conflict with statutes enacted after it. Evers backs the lawsuit.\u00a0\nLawmakers said at the press conference that it was imperative that clarity come sooner rather than later.\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit and wait for the courts to act,\u201d Subeck said. \u201cWe need clarity now.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nEvers said that the motivation behind the bill was to push for real debate on the issue.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a bill,\u201d Evers said. \u201cLet\u2019s have a debate. The Republicans have their bill. The Democrats have their bill. People of Wisconsin should be able to hear a debate about this issue, not silence.\u201d\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) criticized Democrats\u2019 call for debate on Tuesday, saying Democrats are unwilling to compromise on the issue.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 news conference was quite the spectacle, with Governor Evers\u2019 hypocrisy on full display. Last week, Legislative Republicans introduced a bill that\u2019s a reasonable middle ground to the divisive and opposing viewpoints on abortion,\u201d Vos said in a statement. \u201cEvers immediately said he would veto it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLegislative Republicans have continued to say we\u2019re willing to discuss and find consensus,\u201d Vos continued. \u201cInstead, Gov.
