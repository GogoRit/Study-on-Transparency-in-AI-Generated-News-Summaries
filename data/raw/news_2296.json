Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. said on Saturday that support for abortion \u201cis an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar rallies supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire on Feb. 9, 2020.

I am strongly pro-choice, I have always been pro-choice,\u201d Sen. Klobuchar responded. The senator supports taxpayer-funded abortion and the codification of Roe v. Wade into federal law, but told the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0she was \u201cunsure\u201d about allowing chemical abortions to be available over-the-counter.\nSen. Klobuchar has also supported taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers and promoters, and has said that regulations on abortions after 24 weeks in a pregnancy \u201cmust be consistent with Roe v. Wade.\u201d She told the\u00a0Times\u00a0that \u201cattacks on women\u2019s reproductive rights that are happening across the country are coordinated, calculated and dangerous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, Sen. Klobuchar told McCain on Tuesday, she did not think pro-life Democrats should be expelled from the party.\n\u201cI believe we\u2019re a big-tent party. And there are pro-life Democrats, and they are a part of our party,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd I think we need to build a big tent. I think we need to bring people in instead of shutting them out.\u201d\nSen. Klobuchar also\u00a0reportedly told Chris Crawford of Democracy Fund that she would accept the support of pro-life Democrats on Monday.\n\n\nToday I asked @amyklobuchar if there is room in her coalition for pro-life people. She said yes of course. I asked if she\u2019d try to find common ground on bringing down the number of abortions.\n\nShe said \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d And told me about her work in the adoption caucus in the Senate. pic.twitter.com/CIvfMSulEE\n\u2014 Chris Crawford (@CrawfordStuff) February 10, 2020\n\n\nSen. Klobuchar\u2019s comments came as Democratic voters headed to the polls for the New Hampshire primary Feb. 11 and after fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\u00a0said on Saturday that support for abortion \u201cis an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat.\u201d\n\u201cBy this time in history, I think, when we talk about what a Democrat is, I think being pro-choice is essentially\u2014an essential part of that,\u201d Sen. Sanders stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nPete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said at a Jan. 26 townhall in Iowa that he would do without the support of pro-life Democrats if necessary, over his support for legal abortion.\nWhen asked by Kristen Day, the executive director of Democrats for Life of America, if he wanted the support of pro-life Democrats like her, Buttigieg responded that \u201cI am pro-choice. And I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision [on abortion].\u201d\nIf Democratic voters would not support him over that stance, he added, \u201cI understand.\u201d Last week on \u201cThe View,\u201d Buttigieg declined to name a limit on abortion in the third trimester when challeneged about previous statements indication his support for abortion up until the baby\u2019s first breath, instead he said it should be up to the woman to decide and not the government.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\u00a0was asked in a November debate if there was room in the party for someone like Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who was re-elected in November and who signed into law a ban on abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Warren said that abortion rights are \u201ceconomic rights\u201d and \u201chuman rights,\u201d and that the party is \u201cfundamentally\u201d about preserving legal abortion.\nShe added that \u201cI\u2019m not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I\u2019m not here to try to build fences.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nbernie sanders says no room for pro-life democrats\nklobuchar of minnesota\npro-life democrats\nsenator klobuchar says there's room for pro-life democrats\n\n\n\n\nCatholic News Agency \n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Abortion Views, DC Restaurant Boots Pro-Life Group\n\nAccording to a DFLA press release, Busboys and Poets said the cancellation came because its guests \u201creached out about the nature and tenor of the event.\u201d\n\n\nKatie Yoder/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Congressman Dan Lipinski: Pro-Life Groups Must \u2018Wake Up and Do More\u2019 to Support of Pro-Life Democrats\n\nRep.
