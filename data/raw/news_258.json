A February poll by Colombian magazine Semana suggested that nearly 70 percent of the country was opposed to the legalisation of abortion in the first four months of a pregnancy, but abortion rights and anti-abortion rights protests have mounted leading up to Monday\u2019s decision.\nAs the court deliberated, protesters on both sides faced off on the street outside the court building. An invisible ideological wall seemed to run along the city\u2019s main street, dividing the two groups who screamed at each other.\nProtesters with green pro-choice bandanas screamed, \u201cYes, yes, yes for abortion\u201d, while groups with blue anti-abortion rights bandanas screamed back, \u201cYes, yes, yes, for life.\u201d\nThe controversial case was brought to the table by hardline anti-abortion rights lawyer Natalia Bernal in 2019. Bernal asked for a total ban on abortion after a 22-year-old woman in the western Catholic city of Popayan had an abortion at seven months after a psychological assessment noted that she was suffering from severe mental issues like depression as a result of the pregnancy.\n\u201cMy theory is that if abortion rights are increased, there will be many more women who are raped because the rapist knows that the State will permit women to get rid of the consequences of the rape,\u201d Bernal told local media Red+ in late 2019 without providing any evidence to back up her claim.\nBut instead, the legal challenge put on the table the possibility of legalisation.\n\nAn anti-abortion rights activist demonstrates against a rally in support of legal and safe abortion outside the Colombian constitutional court, in Bogota, Colombia [Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters]\n\nThe case came after a wave of feminist movements swept across the region. Of the 33 countries that make up Latin America and the Caribbean, only Uruguay, Cuba and Guayana allow for abortion procedures without a woman needing to prove her pregnancy endangers her life or that she was raped. In Argentina, a similar conversation is playing out as congressional legislators are set to consider a bill that would legalise abortion.\nDespite the shifts, much of the largely Catholic country remains strongly against abortion rights, including Colombian President Ivan Duque who called any move away from the three exceptions \u201cvery tough\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life. I believe life starts at conception,\u201d he said in February.\nLegal red tape\nIn 2006, Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court overturned an all-out ban on abortion and, on paper, Colombia\u2019s laws appear more liberal than neighbouring countries. But the legal red tape associated with the laws make access to abortion in many cases virtually impossible, and women seeking abortions are often asked for proof of rape beyond police reports.\nOther healthcare providers refuse to perform the abortion or create elongated approval processes for women who are often \u201crunning against time\u201d to receive the care, said Cristina Rosero, a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights in Bogota.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re \u201cseeing health professionals just \u2026 putting up illegal obstacles, and they\u2019re not being held accountable for it,\u201d Rosero told Al Jazeera. \u201cThat creates this impunity feeling that lets them not comply with the law because they don\u2019t feel there is going to be any consequence.\u201d\nIn 13 years, 300 legal complaints have been filed from women who say they were denied a legal abortion, yet only three of those cases ended in sanctions of healthcare providers, according to Women\u2019s Link.\n\nDemonstrators and activists take part in a rally in support of legal and safe abortion outside the Colombian constitutional court, in Bogota, Colombia [Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters]\u00a0\n\nIn rural zones of the country also often lack sufficient medical supplies or training to perform such procedures, so such care becomes inaccessible to large swaths of the population.\n\u201cThis is about privilege,\u201d said Avila-Guillen, who recalled that while growing up in a rural area, friends would have to travel more than 350km (217 miles) by bus to get medical attention in Bogota.\nAn estimated 400,400 abortions are performed each year in Colombia, according to US-based reproductive rights organisation Guttmacher Institute. In 2018, private abortion provider Profamilia said 16,878 legal abortions were performed legally.\n\nAn anti-abortion rights activist demonstrates against a rally in support of legal and safe abortion outside the Colombian constitutional court, in Bogota, Colombia [Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters]\u00a0\n\nDespite that being a massive jump in the number of legal procedures from 2008 \u2013 when Guttmacher documented 322 legal procedures performed in medical clinics \u2013 it means the vast majority of abortions performed in the country are still clandestine.\nAlmost 15 percent of maternal deaths across the world are a product of botched clandestine abortions, and women living in rural zones are more likely to experience medical complications than those in cities.\nWhile the court decision did little to change the legal status quo in the South American country, Rosero said the case is still an important step for groups to open new challenges to abortion law in the predominately Catholic country because the court refused to acknowledge Bernal\u2019s challenge.\nIt also, she said, launched a public conversation that is only expected to continue.\n\u201cIt opens the doors for advances which haven\u2019t happened in 14 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a huge step because it means that the public debate is going forward and the people are ready for a conversation.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
