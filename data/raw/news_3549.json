He has also voted against or abstained in all votes relating to expanding abortion provision as an MP, except in the case of Northern Ireland.Katherine O\u2019Brien, the spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas), said giving Caulfield responsibility for abortion was \u201cmore than a disregard for women\u2019s health, it feels like a slap in the face\u201d.She said that as the minister for maternity services, Caulfield would have the ability to block the opening of new abortion clinics, prevent the re-licensing of clinics and even close clinics down.\u201cOur fear is, to be frank, that access to abortion is at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prime minister may have abstained in abortion votes, but by giving Caulfield responsibility for abortion services he has taken an anti-abortion stance.\u201dIn an email seen by the Guardian, the Department of Health confirmed that as minister for mental health and women\u2019s health strategy, Caulfield had responsibility for abortion services, which sit under maternity services. Caulfield is a former member of the all-party parliamentary pro-life group and in 2018 called for a debate on reducing the 24-week time limit for most abortions, describing the English law on abortion as \u201cone of the most liberal\u201d in the world.O\u2019Brien said previously that responsibility for abortion services sat with the minister for public health, most recently Maggie Throup, calling it an \u201cactive decision\u201d to give Caulfield the role.The shadow women and equalities secretary, Anneliese Dodds, called on Sunak to spell out his commitment to women\u2019s right to safe and legal abortion, in light of Caulfield\u2019s appointment and the voting analysis carried out by Labour.Sunak has abstained on all votes relating to abortion since becoming an MP, but voted in favour of giving the Northern Ireland secretary new powers to impose the commissioning of abortion services in Northern Ireland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has abstained on every vote regarding abortion, except in Northern Ireland, since becoming an MP.Tory MP who backed cutting abortion time limit named minister for womenRead more\u201cWomen across the country will be really worried about the voting records of senior members of this government and what that means for their right to access safe and legal abortion,\u201d said Dodds. Labour has supported abortion buffer zones and would \u201calways support women and their right to choose\u201d, she added.Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the appointment of Caulfield as minister for women and health with responsibility for abortion, coupled with the voting records of key members of the cabinet, represented \u201ca threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights\u201d.The Department of Health and Social Care said the government took a neutral stance on abortion, and that it was for parliament to decide the circumstances under which abortions could take place.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenRishi SunakJeremy HuntHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
