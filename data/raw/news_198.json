At this clinic, she cannot by law virtually prescribe the abortion medication some patients seek.\u201cHealth care has been on this tremendous transformation, since March, in terms of teleheath and meeting people's needs in different ways,\u201d Oat-Judge said. \u201cIt seems that the whole system has been transformed in this direction, and it feels like an unfair situation to not be able to offer it uniformly.\u201dNorth Carolina is one of 18 states to ban telemedicine abortions, requiring patients meet physicians in-person to receive abortion pill prescriptions. While pro-life advocates defend this ban as best for women\u2019s health, abortion providers decry the law as an unneeded obstacle to access. The health care industry\u2019s shift towards telemedicine during the pandemic has some providers questioning why North Carolina residents can\u2019t skip physical visits to obtain abortions.Question of trustIn 2008, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland in Iowa became the nation\u2019s first abortion clinic to offer medical abortions through telemedicine. While surgical abortions inherently require hands-on interaction between physicians and patients, medical abortions are performed by ingesting two pills - Mifepristone and Misoprostol. A recent report found 60 percent of women eligible for medical abortions \u2013 at or less than 10 weeks pregnant \u2013 elected pills over surgery.In 2013, North Carolina barred physicians from prescribing Mifepristone, the pill patients take first, without an in-person visit. North Carolina and several states grouped in the South and Midwest continue to forbid physicians from prescribing abortions from a distance.Despite the telemedicine ban, every year sees a greater percentage of North Carolina residents choosing medical abortions over surgeries. A decade ago, less than 20% of all abortions in the state were medical. The most recent state North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services data in 2018 shows nearly half of the 23,000 abortions performed on North Carolina residents were medical abortions.Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the N.C. Values Coalition, argued there was a simple rationale for this ban.\u201cIt\u2019s an easy answer: for the safety of the woman seeking the abortion,\u201d she said. &quot;These are drugs that actually cause the death of the unborn child in the woman.&quot;Fitzgerald, whose organization advocates for pro-life issues, said the abortion pill demanded a higher degree of supervision from physicians than other medicines. If a pregnant person incorrectly estimated their gestation period, taking abortion pills after 10 weeks could be dangerous.Providers acknowledged telemedicine abortions do put more responsibility on patients to provide accurate information.\u201cTo actually trust women is something that in the United States we're not very comfortable doing, said Terry Sallas Merritt, an executive team member at A Woman\u2019s Choice Inc., which operates abortion clinics in Greensboro, Raleigh, and Charlotte. \u201cSo, we have to be willing to say that we trust someone to be able to tell us how far along in the pregnancy they think they are.\u201dSallas Merritt pointed out that under telemedicine, physicians could still order tests to supplement and verify patients\u2019 information. While doctors don\u2019t physically meet patients, they can direct people to have ultrasounds or blood work taken at health clinics closer to their homes., which would save many from coordinating trips to faraway clinics.North Carolina\u2019s 14 abortion clinics are clustered in larger cities, leaving hundreds of miles between many providers.Flexibility or patient safety?The Asheville Planned Parenthood is the state\u2019s only abortion clinic west of Charlotte. Western North Carolina\u2019s geography \u2013 with expansive counties jutting close to South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia \u2013 means in-state and out-of-state residents venture long distances to see doctors.Oat-Judge admitted she didn\u2019t regularly consider the state\u2019s telemedicine abortion ban until COVID-19 pushed many of her other physician duties into virtual spaces. In March, the federal government expanded telemedicine services for Medicare and eased HIPAA, federal standards to shield personal patient information, and allowed doctors to consult with patients via video apps like FaceTime and Skype.\u201cNow I can see how easy it is,\u201d Oat-Judge said. \u201cWe have the technology. It's treating flexibility in accessing care from a time standpoint that is really helpful for people who are working.\u201dShe asserted medical abortions can be performed functionally the same through telemedicine as through a physical visit. And as with other health care services, Oat-Judge said telemedicine possesses additional benefits for abortion patients during COVID-19.\u201cWe could cater to more people who are concerned about the pandemic and leaving their home,\u201d she said.Sallas Merritt contended women facing greater child care responsibilities and tighter finances during the pandemic would also benefit from abortion services that didn\u2019t require them to travel away from home.Fitzgerald downplayed any barriers to access during the pandemic.\u201cAbortion clinics were open, and still are open, and there's no reason a woman cannot visit one of those clinics and obtain drugs under the supervision of a physician person,\u201d she said.Neither the offices of Gov. Roy Cooper nor N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore responded to requests for their views on the telemedicine abortion ban during the pandemic.Sallas Merritt and Oat-Judge have not seen noticeable drops in patient levels at their respective clinics since mid-March. For these providers, the issue isn\u2019t absolute abortion access, but rather what they view as a lack of logic behind the state\u2019s telemedicine ban.\u201cWhat the pandemic has done is to illuminate the many innovative uses of quality patient care through telemedicine, in areas that we wouldn't normally suspect that you would be able to provide medical care,\u201d Sallas Merrit said. \u201cSo, when we see that this is happening everywhere it calls attention more to the idea of why can't it happen in abortion medication care.\u201dReporter Brian Gordon can be reached at bgordon@gannett.com.\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
