Canada\n\nPosted\n\n28 Aug 2020\n\nOriginally published\n\n28 Aug 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Report\n(PDF | 280.94 KB)\n\n\n\n\nNairobi: Friday 28 August 2020 - The Government of Canada has provided CAD$ 11 million to support the Government of Somalia, through UNFPA, on a new initiative on Strengthening Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights through strengthening midwifery education and practice. This includes CAD$ 1 million dedicated to an enhanced response to the current COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health care providers and the patients being treated at health facilities.\nThe initiative is aimed at reducing maternal mortality and promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights. It will increase the number of trained midwives, strengthen teaching capacity in 15 midwifery school, and ensure that health facilities can provide high quality clinical practicum training experience. In addition, the initiative will help update the midwifery curriculum by including respectful maternity care and rights-based sexual and reproductive health content.\n\u201cCanada hopes that this initiative will help ensure that Somalis are able to live to their full potential and become drivers of peace and positive change for themselves, their families and Somalia,\u201d said Her Excellency Lisa Stadelbauer, Ambassador of Canada to Somalia.\nThe Ambassador said Canada is looking forward to the implementation of the initiative to ensure that it contributes to the plans and priorities of the Government of Somalia and that it is coordinated with other investments in the health sector.\nUNFPA Somalia Representative Mr. Anders Thomsen expressed gratitude to the Government of Canada saying the UN agency is dedicated to working with the Government of Somalia towards building a competent, well-trained and well-supported midwifery workforce and developing strong regulatory mechanisms to ensure quality services for women. \u201cMidwives save lives. They are the steadfast champions for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls. They are also the backbone of maternal health systems; delivering babies and much more,\u201d said Mr. Thomsen.\nCanada\u2019s support is coming at the right time when Somalia is stepping up efforts to strengthen skills and competencies for midwives as one way of bringing down the maternal mortality rate which is one of the highest globally. Currently, one in 20 women in Somalia has a lifetime risk of dying while giving life.\n[ENDS]\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nAbout the Embassy of Canada to Somalia\nCanada first established diplomatic relations with Somalia in 1968. These relations were subsequently suspended after the collapse of the Somali government in 1991. Following the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia in 2012, Canada re-established diplomatic relations with Somalia in 2013.  In early 2019, Canada began a program of enhanced bilateral cooperation with Somalia. This enhanced cooperation is focused on improving the health of women and girls, and promoting inclusive and transparent governance.\nPRESS CONTACTS\nNjeri Munyiri, Political and Public Affairs Officer, Canadian High Commission in Kenya Email: njeri.munyiri@international.gc.ca\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nSomalia\n\nOther country\n\nCanada\n\nSource\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\nFormat\n\nNews and Press Release\n\nThemes\n\nContributionsHealthProtection and Human Rights\n\nDisaster type\n\nEpidemic\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nSomalia\n\nUNICEF Somalia Humanitarian Situation Report No. 2, 1 - 29 February 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nUNICEF\n\nPosted\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomalia\n\nSomalia Situation Report, 17 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nOCHA\n\nPosted\n\n17 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n17 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomalia\n\nSomalia Factsheet - Key Figures (As of 29 Feb 2024)\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Infographic          \nSource\n\nOCHA\n\nPosted\n\n16 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n29 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomalia\n\nECHO Factsheet \u2013 Somalia \u2013 (Last updated 27/02/2024)\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            News and Press Release          \nSource\n\nECHO\n\nPosted\n\n6 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n6 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
