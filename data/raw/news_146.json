Cindy Polo of Miami Lakes, center, in November meeting women imprisoned in El Salvador on abortion charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months ago, Democratic state Rep. Cindy Polo of Miami Lakes visited a prison in El Salvador. Polo met an inmate named Berta Margarita Arana, a Salvadoran woman serving eight years for attempting an abortion.After hours talking with Arana, Polo believes the woman did no such thing. She says Arana went into premature labor \u2014 as women in poor countries with poor prenatal care often do \u2014 and was then rushed to a hospital.\u201cAnd when that happens in El Salvador,\u201d Polo says, \u201cmany of these women have been thrown in jail just on an accusation that they were attempting to terminate a pregnancy.\u201dArana was accused by hospital staff. Human rights groups and the U.N. saythat happens all too frequently in El Salvador \u2014 usually with little medical evidence. But it\u2019s part of the reality in that Central American country: El Salvador bans all abortions under any circumstance \u2014 including in cases of rape and when a woman\u2019s life is at risk. Even in Latin America, which has some of the world\u2019s most severe abortion laws, El Salvador stands out for its criminal prosecutions \u2014 and, say critics, Orwellian persecution \u2014 of pregnant women.\u201cThere were so many things that scared me in El Salvador,\u201d Polo says, \u201cbut mostly this anti-woman witch hunt.\u201dREAD MORE:\u00a0Does Escaping El Salvador's Abortion Law Nightmare Mean Flying to Miami?Women there convicted of having an abortion can get as many as 30 years in prison. Those who\u2019ve had miscarriages are often arbitrarily charged with inducing abortion. So are women like Arana \u2014 who did give birth, and whose baby now has to be raised by Arana\u2019s mother because Arana is behind bars.\u201cShe has never spent one night with her child,\u201d Polo says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Salvador Melendez / AP\n/\nAPWomen in San Salvador, El Salvador, call for the release of three women sentenced to 30 years in prison for having abortions.\n\n\n\nPolo was part of a group of lawmakers visiting El Salvador. All were from states that have recently passed bills restricting abortion rights \u2014 including Alabama, which last year banned virtually all abortions. (A federal judge has temporarily blocked that law.) As a result, the legislators wanted to see El Salvador\u2019s absolute abortion ban up close.\u201cI really wanted to learn what the consequences and unintended consequences can be,\u201d Polo says.Polo and the others in the U.S. delegation also wanted to use the El Salvador experience to more effectively confront what they see as a trend at home: states, including Florida, pushing abortion bans in the U.S.\n\n\nSo many things scared me about El Salvador's abortion laws - but mostly the anti-woman witch hunt they've led to. \u2014 Cindy Polo\n\n\n\n\nPolo, who spoke to WLRN from her office in Tallahassee on Jan. 14 as the 2020 Florida legislative session got underway, pointed to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 State of the State address that morning in which he emphasized:\u201cI also hope that the legislature will send me this session the parental consent bill.\u201dDeSantis was referring to new legislation that would strengthen Florida\u2019s 2019 requirement to notify parents of minors seeking an abortion by also making parental consent mandatory.The Republican sponsors \u2014 Rep. Erin Grall of Vero Beach and Sen. Kelli Stargel of Lakeland \u2014 insist their bills are about boosting parental rights, not eroding abortion rights. (They did not respond to WLRN\u2019s request for interviews.)CRUMBLING ARGUMENTBut abortion rights advocates say parental consent requirements \u2014 even if they make exceptions for medical emergencies or pregnancies resulting from incest \u2014 represent the sort of \u201cincremental\u201d abortion limits that led to El Salvador\u2019s blanket ban in the 1990s.\u201cJust having the legal right on paper to an abortion says nothing about a person\u2019s actual ability to get that abortion if she needs it,\u201d says Kelly Baden, vice president for reproductive rights at State Innovation Exchange, or SiX, a liberal nonprofit based in Wisconsin. SiX and the nonprofit Women\u2019s Equality Center in New York arranged the legislators\u2019 El Salvador visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Steve Cannon / AP\n/\nAPGOP Florida state Rep. Erin Grall of Vero Beach, one of the sponsors of legislation mandating parental consent for minors seeking an abortion.\n\n\n\nU.S. anti-abortion rights advocates say that comparing their campaign to El Salvador\u2019s situation is an unfair exaggeration. They insist the U.S. pro-life lobby isn\u2019t aiming for the police state, \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d dystopia much of Latin America has become \u2014 and they say U.S. state bans would imprison only abortion providers for murder, not women.But Baden says even that argument is now crumbling.\u201cA bill introduced in Texas last year had criminal penalties for women who received abortion care,\u201d she points out, referring to a bill that eventually did not pass. \u201cAnd then while we were in El Salvador, a bill in Ohio [HB 413] was announced to ban abortion and has criminal penalties for women.\u201dIn El Salvador, Mariana Moisa, spokeswoman for the Citizen Group for Decriminalizing Abortion, a nonprofit that hosted the U.S. lawmakers, said she hopes her country's example will give Americans pause.\"They should be reminded,\" she told WLRN from San Salvador, \"that absolute abortion bans most cruelly affect poor women and victims of sexual violence. Like teenaged girls forced to give birth even after being raped.\u201dThat\u2019s a large part of what now motivates Polo, who says her low-income constituents are among the women most apt to be impacted by tighter abortion limits. She believes abortion rights advocates, especially legislators like herself, need to highlight their plight more prominently.\u201cOne of the responsibilities I take to heart as a first-generation American-born Latina in office,\u201d says Polo, who is Colombian American, \u201cis to not let these scare tactics hijack women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\u201dIf more legislators take Polo\u2019s cue, the reality in El Salvador could now become part of the debate in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nLatin America Report\nAmericasLatin AmericaEl SalvadorabortionRep.
