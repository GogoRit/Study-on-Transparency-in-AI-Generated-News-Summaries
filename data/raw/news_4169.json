Australia is serious about protecting women\u2019s privacy, it should prohibit all forms of anti-abortion conduct outside of clinics, including silent prayer. \n\nWritten by\u00a0Tania Penovic and\u00a0Ronli SifrisIntroductionOn June 3rd the\u00a0Health Care (Safe Access) Amendment Bill 2020 was introduced into South Australia\u2019s House of Assembly. The aim of this Bill is to establish \u201chealth access zones\u201d(commonly known as \u201csafe access zones\u201d) around abortion clinics, prohibiting anti-abortion conduct from taking place with a 150m radius of premises at which abortions are lawfully performed. If this Bill passes, it will bring South Australia in line with all other Australian jurisdictions (except for Western Australia) with respect to the protection of women seeking to access the full range of reproductive health care. Such an initiative is to be commended and supported, particularly given that in\u00a0Clubb v Edwards; Preston v Avery the High Court confirmed the constitutionality of safe access zone legislation (specifically in this case the\u00a0Victorian and\u00a0Tasmanian laws).In the past few weeks, there has been some discussion regarding whether the Bill should be amended so as to permit silent prayer within the health access zones. As human rights academics and researchers who have conducted in-depth research into this issue, we strongly oppose such an amendment for the reasons set out below.Silent prayer should have no place within health access zonesBetween March 2017 and December 2019, we conducted nationwide qualitative empirical research which examined the experience and impact of anti-abortion conduct outside Australian clinics and the effectiveness of safe access zone laws. As such, we are familiar with the various forms of conduct which take place outside abortion clinics and believe that silent prayer outside abortion clinics has a harmful impact on patients seeking healthcare services. It causes shame, stigmatisation and a sense of being watched which undermines privacy and dignity in the context of access to lawful medical services. Silent prayer should not be permitted within health access zones.Unlike other picketing activity, silent prayer is not aggressive or individually targeted. But it is clear from our research that the presence of individuals engaged in silent prayer outside clinics has the effect of shaming and stigmatising women and undermining their privacy and dignity. The presence of people praying outside clinics has been described by our interviewees as deeply judgmental and distressing for women seeking access to reproductive health care services.The distress caused to patients by such conduct was described in the following terms by Victoria Dolphin,\u00a0Nurse Unit Manager at Marie Stopes in the Australian Capital Territory:We've had one woman that's come in very distressed that \u2018a man was out there praying for me, I know he was praying for me.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0And I think it's because of that self-perceived shame as well, and I think that's the real shame about patients in this setting, is they judge themselves before they even get here.\u00a0\u00a0And to have to face that they feel even more judged even if they're not approached, just from that visual.\u00a0\u00a0Ms Dolphin observed that persons engaged in prayer were \u2018not aggressive\u2019 and were \u2018older men\u2019 who were \u2018reading their bibles with their rosary beads.\u2019 Their presence heightened the shame and stigmatisation experienced by women accessing abortion services.The shaming and stigmatisation associated with such conduct was a common theme in our interviews. A general practitioner working in regional Victoria spoke of the sense of being judged and shamed in the following terms:You only need five people, or even three people, standing there \u2026 they're men of a particular age and I think my gosh we know that men are a symbol in many cases\u2026 of authority in our society. I think that having an older man standing there, I think they do to a degree feel that\u2019s the whole of society that\u2019s judging them. Especially the young ones are not so good at making those rational assessments of the true situation.Susan Fahey, the former CEO of Women\u2019s Legal Service Tasmania, described prayer activity occurring outside clinics as being intended to shame and stigmatise women. She elaborated as follows:I respect people's right to religion and other things but I reject quite strongly anyone who says praying is not intended to shame and not intended to whatever-it's highly judgemental and it's highly upsetting to the people who have to pass that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prayer and stigmatisation in the United KingdomOur conclusions with respect to shaming and stigmatisation are consistent with research undertaken in a number of cities in the United Kingdom: see Pam Lowe and Graeme Hayes, \u2018Anti-Abortion Clinic Activism, Civil Inattention and the Problem of Gendered Harassment\u2019, 53(2) 2019\u00a0Sociology 330-346.Lowe and Hayes concluded that those engaged in silent prayer understand their own actions to be supportive and empathic but that their conduct undermines women\u2019s privacy and has a stigmatising effect. They\u00a0observe that \u2018[w]hile their stated objective might be praying to end abortion\u2019 their conduct outside clinics constitutes a \u2018deliberate attempt to deter women from exercising their reproductive rights, further contributing to the stigmatisation of abortion\u2019. Such conduct was experienced by women seeking abortions as harassment and was found to undermine women\u2019s expectations of privacy in accessing lawful medical services. Lowe and Hayes observe as follows:While it is the case that anyone could see people entering and exiting a building, anti-abortion activists who stand outside clinics are expressly there to draw attention to the building as part of their mission to bear witness. The harassment that women feel, we argue, stems from the presence of activists at clinic sites, rather than from their precise conduct\u2026The failure by anti-abortion activists to civilly disattend directly challenges women\u2019s expectations of privacy and confidentiality, and makes their access of a specific reproductive healthcare service material and public. Moreover, the context of abortion stigma heightens the discrediting that some women feel when seeking services.\u00a0What about freedom of religion?The freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion is not absolute. Under international human rights law, the freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion may be subject to limitations prescribed by law which are necessary to pursue a legitimate aim, including the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. The presence of individuals praying outside abortion clinics undermines women\u2019s fundamental rights. It undermines the right to privacy and dignity. It undermines their right of access to healthcare services and to the highest attainable standard of health. It sends a message of shame and stigmatisation to women accessing lawful medical services.If South Australia is serious about protecting women\u2019s privacy, well-being and dignity in the context of access to the full range of reproductive healthcare services, it should prohibit all forms of anti-abortion conduct outside of clinics, including silent prayer.Posted 26 June 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge and pay respects to the Elders and Traditional Owners of the land on which our Australian campuses stand.
