(AP) \u2014 Tennessee\u2019s GOP-dominant Statehouse on Tuesday took a first step toward loosening one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, advancing a narrow exemption bill over threats from anti-abortion advocates that doing so would come with political retribution.Tennessee currently has no explicit exemptions in its abortion ban. Instead the law includes an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d for doctors, meaning that the burden is on the physician to prove that an abortion was medically necessary, instead of requiring the state to prove the opposite. Republican Gov. Bill Lee and other top GOP leaders have spent months defending the current law, arguing that pregnant women are protected from harm and doctors are unlikely to face any felony charges as outlined in the statute. However a group of Republican lawmakers have begun pushing back and saying the ban should be changed. \n\nThat tension was apparent Tuesday when a Republican-controlled panel advanced legislation removing the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d element and clarifying situations where abortion is allowed, including adding ectopic pregnancies, \u201cmedically futile pregnancies\u201d and lethal fetal anomalies. There is no exception for rape and incest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee lawmakers propose changes to how books get removed from school libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee House advances bill to ban reappointing lawmakers booted for behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia governor launches ads to fight abortion travel bans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one wants to tell their spouse, child or loved one that their life is not important in a medical emergency as you watch them die when they could have been saved,\u201d said Republican Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, the bill\u2019s sponsor. \u201cThis bill clarifies what I believe was the original intent of (the law), which is to ban elective abortion in the state of Tennessee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Republicans said doctors are currently terrified to do their job out of fear of being prosecuted and losing their medical license. \u201cWe have to protect our doctors,\u201d said Rep. Sabi Kumar, who is a surgeon. \u201cSo they feel they\u2019re fulfilling the Hippocratic oath, doing God\u2019s work, saving and preserving lives \u2014 that\u2019s what physicians do.\u201d\n\nOne of the most vocal opponents to changing the law has been Tennessee Right to Life, which already revoked its endorsement of a GOP lawmaker after the physician said he supported explicit exemptions. After a lengthy back-and-forth with House committee members, Will Brewer, the group\u2019s lobbyist said there could be more consequences for those who back the change.\u201cI would not consider this a pro-life law. And in discussions with with our (political action committee), they have informed me that they would score this negatively,\u201d he said.\u201cOnce one doctor is let off the hook in a criminal trial, it would be open season for other doctors that wanted to perform bad-faith terminations,\u201d Brewer said.His remarks sparked pushback from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and also prompted Speaker Cameron Sexton to join the hearing and issue a firm rebuke. \u201cIt\u2019s beneath the dignity of this committee, and it\u2019s an offense to my colleagues in here to have a witness come before this committee and assert political campaign threats during testimony,\u201d Sexton said. Sexton has been one of the more prominent Republican to call for changes to the law. He has said the burden of proof should be on prosecutors, not doctors, and he would support exceptions for rape and incest. \n\nDemocrats have supported the changes, even if they would like to see them go further.\u201cIt is important to find common ground and work across the aisle to make families, women, doctors feel safe regardless of whether I personally consider it too little progress,\u201d Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons said. \u201cFor this reason I\u2019m going to support this legislation proudly as a minimum step in the right direction.\u201d The proposal still has several steps before it can go before Gov. Lee\u2019s desk. In the Senate, Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally has said he doesn\u2019t believe the abortion ban needs changing but he won\u2019t block any proposals from moving forward.Lee has declined to say publicly whether he would veto any changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
