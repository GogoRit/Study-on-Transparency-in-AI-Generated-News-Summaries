President-elect Biden has a long career of fighting for health care and reproductive rights. He led the effort to create the Affordable Care Act, spearheaded the Violence Against Women Act, and strongly supports the right to safe, legal abortion. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as the first woman of color to hold the office, is a champion for women\u2019s health, health care equity, and LGBTQ+ rights. \u00a0\nStatement from Sarah Stoesz, President of the Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund:\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris clinch their win. They garnered more votes than any other presidential ticket and are the people\u2019s clear choice to lead the country. Sexual and reproductive health care was also very clearly on the ballot and voters\u2019 voices were loud and clear that they want a more fair and just society with leaders who are champions for health care and reproductive freedom.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration was relentless in attacking reproductive rights at home and abroad, and we have a long journey ahead to build back a better health care system, including support for people who rely on Planned Parenthood for expert sexual and reproductive health care.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the Biden administration to deliver on its vision for change; the Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund will be there every step of the way.\u201d\nAmericans were clear where they stood even before this election: nearly nine in 10 women in this country will use birth control in their lifetimes,\u00a077 percent of Americans\u00a0don\u2019t want to see Roe v. Wade overturned and\u00a070 percent of Americans\u00a0favor ending the global gag rule. And as the polls closed, they made themselves clear again.\nUpon taking office, the Biden administration must end the global and domestic gag rules so that health care providers and patients can speak freely about all reproductive health care options; propose a budget that reflects a commitment to sexual and reproductive health \u2014 including ending the Hyde and Helms amendments; nominate reproductive health champions to executive branch positions and judicial seats; and more.\nBeyond reproductive health, the new administration will have work to do across all policy areas. We need to truly protect people against the health and economic consequences of COVID-19 with comprehensive relief. We need to truly reckon with systemic racism, injustice, and state-sanctioned violence in this country. America\u2019s new leaders have a mandate to take serious, action-oriented steps that move our society towards equity \u2014 in health care and beyond. The list is long, but Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund will be there to hold this administration accountable for its promises to the American people.\n###\nFounded in 1992, the Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit organization. As the advocacy and electoral arm of PPMNS, we mobilize supporters of all parties to defend and increase access to family planning services and fact based, medically accurate sexuality education. We work to inspire and engage citizens to take up the cause of reproductive health and rights through education, electoral activity, grassroots organizing and legislative advocacy.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our virtual volunteering events!\n\nBecome a voice of progress for reproductive health.\u00a0\u00a0Sign up and be a change maker.\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Mailing List\n\nGet the latest legislative updates, sexual and reproductive health news, and action alerts by subscribing to our email list.\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is controlled and operated by Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund, Inc..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund works to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nVolunteer\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota Action Fund, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
