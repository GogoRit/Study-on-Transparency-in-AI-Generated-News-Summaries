Some scholars and activists caution, however, that the narrow decision does not necessarily signal abortion rights will be protected by the high court in future cases.  \nIn a surprise 5-4 decision, the conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined liberal justices in striking down the law, which would have required abortion providers in Louisiana to have admitting privileges to a hospital within 30 miles. If upheld, the law could have shut down all but one abortion clinic in the state. \nWATCH: What Supreme Court decision on Louisiana law means for U.S. abortion rights\n\u201cI was sort of bracing for a defeat for the abortion providers, so in some respect, I was pleasantly surprised\u201d by Roberts joining the liberal justices in the decision, said Melissa Murray, an NYU law professor specializing in family law, constitutional law, reproductive rights and justice. But, she warned, \u201cI think it\u2019s a much more muted victory than many perhaps appreciate. The chief justice is very clear that his views on abortion haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\nWhen Roberts served as an attorney in two consecutive Republican administrations \u2014 those of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush \u2014 he helped author briefs arguing that Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion nationwide, was wrongly decided and should be overturned. But in his Senate confirmation hearing in 2005, he agreed that the case was settled law and said he would err toward respecting precedent. \nHere\u2019s a look at the implications of the June 29 decision on June Medical Services LLC. v. Russo, and what it means for abortion rights and access in the U.S. going forward. \nImplications of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nThe Louisiana law blocked last week was the second so-called TRAP law \u2014 or Targeted Regulation Against Abortion Providers \u2014 to make its way to the Supreme Court within the last five years. \nIt was the first time an abortion case was heard since President Donald Trump filled the high court\u2019s vacancies by appointing two conservative justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn reinstating the Casey standard, he\u2019s gutted Whole Woman\u2019s Health. We\u2019re back to 1992.\u201d\n\nThe legal argument that TRAP laws hinge on is the idea that \u201cabortion is in some ways bad for women,\u201d according to Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University specializing in the legal history of reproduction and author of \u201cAbortion in America: A Legal History from Roe to the Present.\u201d\nZiegler said the idea behind these laws is that if abortion clinics have more stringent requirements, women will have \u201cbetter continuity of care.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s part of this general argument that abortion, and abortion providers, are unsafe,\u201d she said when speaking with the PBS NewsHour in February. \nKathaleen Pittman, a clinic administrator at Hope Medical Group in Louisiana and a plaintiff in the the Supreme Court case, told the NewsHour in March that the state had tried everything to decimate access to abortion care.\n\u201cThe situation here is already dire and this law would be the last straw for most of the remaining clinics. We\u2019re hopeful that the court will recognize how devastating this law would be for women in our state,\u201d Pittman said in March. \nThe Supreme Court did end up siding with the health clinic, largely because it had already ruled back in 2016 that a similar Texas rule requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges placed a \u201csubstantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion,\u201d constituting \u201can undue burden on abortion access.\u201d\nCiting this precedent set in the 2016 case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, Chief Justice Roberts sided with the liberal justices in blocking the Louisiana regulation from taking effect, even though he had ruled against the Texas law while on the high court in 2016. \n\u201cI joined the dissent in Whole Woman\u2019s Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided,\u201d Roberts wrote, citing the Texas law that was struck down in 2016. The question today however is not whether Whole Woman\u2019s Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case.\u201d\nAbortion opponents protested the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Kristen Waggoner, the general counsel and SVP of the Alliance Defending Freedom, which signed an amicus brief in support of the Louisiana law, likened reproductive rights advocates\u2019 argument that hospital admitting privileges actually endanger women to \u201cthe fox guarding the hen house.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold abortion to the same standard that we hold other doctors,\u201d Waggoner told the NewsHour. \u201cAnd I think the standard should be applied to protect women no matter where their feelings are on the abortion issue itself.\u201d\nLouisiana\u2019s Solicitor General, Elizabeth Murrill, who defended the law before the Supreme Court, also said that clinics such as the ones targeted in the June Medical Services case actually endanger women\u2019s health. \u201cHere we have a history of egregious health and safety violations by the clinics and by the doctors who work there,\u201d Murrill said in an interview with the NewsHour when the Supreme Court heard arguments for the case in March. She added that abortion providers had a vested interest \u201cin being less regulated and having less oversight.\u201d\nWhile complications do arise from abortion in the U.S., severe consequences, such as death, are rare. A report released by the non-partisan National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in 2018 found that abortion is largely a safe procedure. It noted, though, that TRAP laws and other regulations instituted by states \u2014 such as waiting periods and pre-abortion ultrasounds \u2014 can complicate and delay the procedure, making it less safe.  \nEven though another law targeting abortion has been struck down by the court for now, NYU Law\u2019s Murray cautioned that the narrow nature of Roberts\u2019 opinion could actually galvanize anti-abortion activists to pursue more restrictive laws in the future. This is because he cited another 1992 abortion case, Casey v. Planned Parenthood, in his reasoning. \nMurray noted that while the Casey decision affirmed the right to an abortion, it also lowered the standards by which courts review abortion legislation, and allowed states to put in place \u201cregulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion,\u201d as long they do not impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s ability to obtain the procedure. \nWhile the decision was a nominal victory for the anti-abortion side, Murray said it actually empowered states to continue restricting access to the procedure. She worries the same could happen following the June v. Russo decision. \nIn his opinion, Roberts wrote, \u201cthe only question for a court is whether a law has the \u2018effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\u2019\u201d He encouraged courts not to weigh the specific benefits against the burdens of abortion laws, as the 2016 Supreme Court decision on the Texas law did, but rather to simply decide whether the proposed legislation poses an obstacle to women who are seeking abortions. \nMurray called this a \u201cmore amorphous\u201d standard. \u201cIn reinstating the Casey standard, he\u2019s gutted Whole Woman\u2019s Health,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re back to 1992. And I think what you will see is states empowered to continue restricting access, and courts no longer tethered to weighing benefits\u201d against the burdens of abortion laws like the Louisiana one, she added. \nThe ADF\u2019s Waggoner, though, said she saw Roberts\u2019 line of decision-making as a positive step for the anti-abortion movement, as it may allow states \u201cto regulate abortion providers in a way that protects women as long as there\u2019s a reasonable relation to a legitimate state interest.\u201d\nHow other laws are affecting access to abortion right now\nWhile one Louisiana abortion restriction has been settled for now, the issue is by no means going away. There are some 15 abortion cases that are just one step away from making it to the Supreme Court, according to Planned Parenthood. While some of the restrictions in question are similar to the Louisiana law, many others ban abortion at various points in pregnancy, or on the basis of disability. Others ban specific types of abortion, such as dialation and evacuation.   \nThese laws are part of a broader strategy by the anti-abortion movement to pursue a patchwork of legislation that gradually chips away at abortion access in the hopes of eventually overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAs of July 1, 22 states had banned abortion between 13 and 24 weeks from a woman\u2019s last menstrual period, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research institution that advocates for abortion rights. Three states \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana and Utah \u2014 had attempted to ban abortion at any point in a pregnancy, but those bills were blocked by the courts. \nIn mid-June, Tennessee lawmakers passed a bill that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The Iowa legislature passed a bill that same week that would require women to wait 24 hours before receiving an abortion, and Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed a law banning abortion based on race, sex or genetic issues on July 1.   \nSome states more recently tried to limit abortions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Texas, for example, declaring that abortion doesn\u2019t qualify as an essential surgery. While those bans are no longer in play today \u2014 they have been blocked by the courts \u2014 some could return as states respond to another spike in coronavirus cases. \nThe Guttmacher Institute\u2019s state policy director, Elizabeth Nash, said that she would not be surprised to see states emboldened by the  June Medical Services decision pursuing more restrictions similar to the Louisiana law, with the thinking that the courts will be less stringent in weighing the benefits against the burdens of such requirements. \n\u201cAbortion opponents read these cases very carefully and amend their strategy based on the rulings,\u201d Nash told the PBS Newshour. \u201cIt would not surprise me to see abortion restrictions next year that look to these kind of restrictions. You may see states that have, say, counseling and waiting period laws look to make them more burdensome in some way.\u201d\nLaws targeting abortion providers have affected access to clinics over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2017 the number of abortion clinics in the U.S. dropped by almost 4 percent, but states in the South were more heavily impacted, with a net decline of 50 clinics \u2014 25 in Texas alone. The Midwest lost a net 33 clinics in the same time period. Both regions had the largest share of new abortion restrictions in the country.\nCatherine Glenn Foster, the president & CEO of Americans United Life, argued in an interview with the Newshour last fall that disparities in access are tied to the fact that abortion is a profit-making venture: \u201cThere are large parts of the country that don\u2019t have a lot of people, and those are places where there aren\u2019t many abortion facilities, but that\u2019s a business decision.\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t think of \u201canything less feminist\u201d than the \u201csentiment that we can\u2019t have an education, career, plan for families without legalized abortion.\u201d\nBut reproductive rights organizations view the issue differently, and already see state-level challenges to abortion as a blow to the reproductive rights movement. \n\u201cThe likelihood of the Supreme Court going out of its way this year to overrule Roe vs. Wade is fairly low, but it can do the exact same thing in terms of an actual person\u2019s ability to access abortion by making it harder and harder or impossible to challenge these laws,\u201d Andrew Beck, a senior staff attorney for the Reproductive Freedom Project at American Civil Liberties Union, told the NewsHour.\nGuttmacher\u2019s Nash said the increasingly conservative makeup of the Supreme Court could pose a serious challenge to abortion access in the coming years. \n\u201cThere is a real palpable threat to abortion rights at the Supreme Court,\u201d said Nash. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from Roberts\u2019 opinion that he would support abortion restrictions.\u201d\nCourtney Norris contributed reporting to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A demonstrator holds up an abortion flag outside of the U.S. Supreme Court as justices hear a major abortion case on the legality of a Republican-backed Louisiana law.
