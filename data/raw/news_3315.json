Jackson Women's Health Organization.\u00a0\n\nView or download the video here.\nPartial Transcript:\n\u00a0\nCongratulations To All Pro-Life Warriors\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor almost 50 years, we\u2019ve taken our stand for life. It\u2019s been against a rising tide of moral decay. But, with courage and dedication, we built a society that cherishes life at all stages. I want to offer my gratitude to the advocates, the lawmakers, the sidewalk counselors, the doctors, and other compassionate hearts who worked so hard to guide America into her post-Roe era.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Fate Of The Unborn Is Back With The States Where It Belongs\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has confirmed that Roe v. Wade was a blatant act of judicial activism that put the fate of the unborn in the hands of unelected judges. Now, at last, that authority is back with the states where it belongs, and We the People have the power to make our voices heard by voting.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Work To Affirm The Sanctity Of Life Is Far From Over\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn behalf of the 63 million babies we lost to Roe\u2019s culture of death, I call on each of you to keep up the fight. Here in Washington, I will champion the pro-life movement with a resolution reaffirming Congress\u2019 commitment to providing women with the resources they need to choose life, and help their children thrive.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/6/video-release-senator-blackburn-praises-pro-life-movement-following-dobbs-decision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nSubscribe to the Blackburn Report\n\n\nSpeeches\n\n\nColumns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice Locations\n\n\nMemphis\nJackson\nNashville\nChattanooga\nKnoxville\nTri-cities\nD.C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemphis Office\n100 Peabody Place\nSuite 1125\nMemphis, TN  38103\nPhone: (901) 527-9199\nFax: (901) 527-9515\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson Office\n109 S Highland Ave\nSuite 218\nJackson, TN  38301\nPhone: (731) 660-3971\nFax: (731) 660-3978\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNashville Office\n719 Church Street\nSuite 2100\nNashville, TN  37203\nPhone: (629) 800-6600\nFax: (615) 298-2148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChattanooga Office\n10 West M.
