Pritzker on Monday announced a slew of new steps to increase access to reproductive care in Illinois. \n\u201cUnlike some other states, in the fourteen months since the Supreme Court made the archaic and destructive decision to overturn Roe V. Wade, Illinois has doubled down on our commitment to protect and expand reproductive rights for patients and providers alike,\u201d Pritzker said in a press release. \u201cThis most recent batch of nation-leading policy expands access even further\u2014because in the Land of Lincoln, we will not go backwards. \nOne of those measures, the release says, is to build a Reproductive Health Public Navigation Hotline that will \"aid patients, including those travelling from out of state, in finding and navigating care.\" The $10 million program from the Illinois Department of Public Health would launch in 2024, officials said. \nAnother initiative, the release says, is a hospital navigation program known as Complex Abortion Regional Line for Access (CARLA) which is \"designed to give appropriate and expeditious treatment to patients who present for abortions at clinics,\" but need a higher level of care than those clinics can provide. \n\n\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.\n\n\n\nThe program, a partnership between the IDPH, Rush University, the University of Chicago, the Chicago Abortion Fund and Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, will include a nurse-staffed hotline meant to help patients schedule appointments within hospital systems and more. \nOther measures include the creation of a family planning program for Medicaid, a Capital Grant Program that provides $5 million to support reproductive health care providers in the state, and a travel reimbursement program for Illinois employees who live out of state and must travel to access \"safe and sufficient reproductive care.\" \n\"Illinois will remain a safe haven for women,\" Pritzker said, \"and I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure widespread, equitable access to reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nLocal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLollapalooza\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 hour ago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2024 Chicago Lollapalooza lineup revealed: Blink-182, The Killers, SZA among headliners\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllinois State Fair\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 hours ago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllinois State Fair adds Miranda Lambert to star-studded 2024 grandstand lineup\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Indiana's near-ban on abortion stands \nThe initiatives come as Indiana on Tuesday was set to impose a near-ban on abortion. \nHowever, the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana asked the state\u2019s high court Monday to keep Indiana\u2019s near-total\u00a0abortion ban\u00a0on hold while it pursues a narrower preliminary injunction in a trial court to address the scope of the ban\u2019s exemption allowing women facing serious health risks to obtain abortions.\nThe petition seeking a rehearing will delay the ban from taking effect as soon as Tuesday while the Indiana Supreme Court considers the matter. The ACLU of Indiana\u2019s request comes after the high court ruled on June 30 that Indiana\u2019s Republican-backed ban doesn\u2019t violate the state constitution.\nThe ACLU of Indiana, representing\u00a0Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic operators, had challenged the constitutionality of the ban. A county judge later ruled that the ban likely\u00a0violated the state constitution\u2019s privacy protections.\nBut in its June ruling, the high court\u00a0struck down\u00a0the county judge\u2019s injunction that has blocked a 2022 law\u2019s restrictions banning the vast majority of abortions in the state since September.\nIn its decision, the court said that while the state constitution\u2019s liberty clause \u201cprotects a woman\u2019s right to an abortion that is necessary to protect her life or to protect her from a serious health risk, the provision does not protect a fundamental right to abortion in all circumstances.\u201d\nAn exemption under the ban states that it is limited to circumstances in which an abortion is necessary \u201cto prevent death or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\nIn Monday\u2019s petition for rehearing, the ACLU of Indiana wrote that the high court\u2019s ruling had \u201cleft open the possibility that this constitutionally protected right \u2018may be broader than the current statutory exception.\u2019\u201d\nGavin Rose, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Indiana, said the group is asking the high court to pause its order striking down the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction to give it time to file a motion with the trial court seeking \u201ca more limited injunction targeted to the breadth of the serious health risk exemption.\u201d\nThe rehearing petition suggests that the court keep the previous injunction on hold for 60 to 90 days.\nThe ACLU of Indiana filed its petition for a rehearing on behalf of abortion providers hours before Monday\u2019s deadline for it to do so.\nRebecca Gibron, CEO of the Planned Parenthood division that includes Indiana, said in a statement about the rehearing request that the state\u2019s ban \u201cwill prevent pregnant Hoosiers from making decisions about their own bodies, and prevent their providers from giving them the care they need.\u201d\nFollowing the court\u2019s June ruling, Indiana\u2019s abortion ban was expected to take effect as soon as Tuesday \u2014 or within days afterward once the ruling is certified and entered into the court docket \u2014 if no party sought a review by Monday\u2019s deadline.\nNow that the ACLU of Indiana has filed a petition for review, that means the court\u2019s decision cannot be certified while the justices consider whether to grant or deny that petition, \u201cthus considering the case or disposing of the rehearing petition,\u201d said Kathryn Dolan, a court spokesperson.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long it may take the high court to decide the matter, but after rehearing petitions are filed, the opposing party \u2014 in this case the state\u2019s attorneys \u2014 have 15 days to file a response to that request.\nIndiana became the\u00a0first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions\u00a0after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal protections by\u00a0overturning Roe v. Wade\u00a0in June 2022.\nThe state\u2019s ban will eliminate the licenses for all seven abortion clinics in the state and ban most abortions, even in the earliest stages of a pregnancy. It includes exceptions allowing abortions at hospitals in cases of rape or incest before 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also allows abortions up to 20 weeks to protect the life and physical health of the mother or if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly.\nCurrent Indiana laws generally prohibit abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and tightly restrict it after the 13th week.\nIndiana\u2019s abortion ban also faces a\u00a0separate court challenge\u00a0over claims it violates the state\u2019s 2015 religious freedom law signed by GOP then-Gov. Mike Pence. The state\u2019s intermediate Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in that case Dec. 6.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under:\nJB PritzkerReproductive rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTrending Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnews\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t31-year-old earns $220,000 a year and saves 75% of his salary by living with his parents: \u2018I'm grateful for this choice'\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllinois Election 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWho's on your ballot?
