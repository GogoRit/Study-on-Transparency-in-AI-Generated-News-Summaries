The latter is one of the main reasons cited for the roughly 1,000 legal terminations performed in Poland each year.\n\nLawmakers with the ruling Law and Justice party were among those who sought the court\u2019s review. They say they want to ensure fetuses with Down syndrome are allowed to be born.POLAND IN THE BIGGER PICTURE\nKlementyna Suchanow, one of the main organizers with the initiative Women\u2019s Strike, the key force behind the protests, said Poland is just one element in a global struggle where democracies face a challenge from fundamentalist and authoritarian forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever happens now in Poland will be crucial for democracy worldwide, says Suchanow, the author of \u201cThis is War: Women, Fundamentalists, and the new Middle Ages,\u201d a book on international ultra-conservative groups that want to ban all abortions.The groups say they are fighting to preserve traditional families, and also fight same-sex marriage.The slogan \u201cThis is War\u201d has been repeated often on banners carried at the protests in Poland.\n\nCOMPROMISE BROKENPoland already had one of Europe\u2019s most restrictive laws, hammered out in 1993 between political and Catholic church leaders. It allowed abortions only in the cases of fetal defects, risk to the woman\u2019s health and incest or rape.It was born from difficult negotiations after the fall of communism, when the Soviet bloc countries had liberal abortion laws. The church, long repressed by the communist regime, sought a full ban in line with its view that all life must be protected from the moment of conception.Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former left-wing president, said this week: \u201cIt seems to me that in 1993, it was the only possible compromise.\u201dHowever, neither side has ever been satisfied with the 1993 law.Earlier attempts by the conservative ruling party to replace it with a blanket ban on abortions were met with enormous street protests in 2016 and 2017, and shelved.POLITICAL CALCULATIONSThe government appears to have calculated that it could change the law with less of a backlash by getting a court under its political control to do the job \u2014 during the pandemic. If so, the plan has backfired.The ruling Law and Justice party won a second term in 2019 and President Andrzej Duda, a party ally, was re-elected this summer. With three years to go before the next elections, it seemed the right time to push through an unpopular move that is widely understood as a reward to the church and ultraconservative groups for their political support.\n\nWhile a large majority of Poles disapprove of the court ruling, some of the protesters\u2019 methods have also met with disapproval, including vulgar language, vandalizing churches and disrupting Masses.\u201cIf they continue that way, they will lose support,\u201d said Marcin Zaborowski, a political analyst and author with Visegrad Insight, a policy journal focused on Central Europe.THE COURT\u2019S AUTHORITYThe Constitutional Tribunal, which ruled to restrict abortion, is itself the product of a separate controversy: the ruling party\u2019s takeover of the courts, an issue at the heart of a 5-year standoff with the European Union.Of 15 judges on the court, 14 were picked by Law and Justice for nine-year terms, three of them chosen in a manner that violates Polish law.\n\nThis has led some legal scholars to declare that the court itself is illegitimate and that the abortion ruling has no legal validity. Many critics now refer to the court as \u201cJulia Przylebska\u2019s tribunal,\u201d a reference to the court president who is a Law and Justice party loyalist.\u201cThis is an ineffective ruling from the constitutional court. It has no legal consequences,\u201d said Michal Wawrykiewicz, a lawyer with Free Courts, an initiative fighting for rule of law. Wawrykiewicz said the ruling is likely to unleash legal chaos because the government will treat it as legally binding but many doctors will not. If doctors are sued for performing abortions of damaged fetuses, they will be sued in lower courts, where judges have maintained a large degree of independence and can be expected to rule in their favor. Ultimately the issue will need to be resolved by the EU\u2019s Court of Justice.\n\nA YOUTH REVOLTWhile traditionally conservative, Poland has also been undergoing massive social changes under the influence of EU membership, which has led many Poles to travel and study abroad, and of popular culture influences such as Netflix.The protests of the past week have been dominated by young people, who believe that the abortion ruling infringes on their liberties. Dominika Stankiewicz, a 26-year-old who was handing out protest stickers and posters in Warsaw\u2019s Mokotow district on Thursday, said abortion is the only issue that has ever brought her to the streets to protests. \u201cThis is too much right now,\u201d she said. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?With society in upheaval, people are discussing ways out. President Andrzej Duda on Friday proposed a bill that would allow abortions in cases where the fetus is so deformed that it could not survive after birth, but ban them for Down syndrome.Women\u2019s rights activists and opposition politicians immediately condemned that idea. Protest organizers are now pushing for the government to resign and a liberal abortion law to be passed \u2014 though neither seem like realistic prospects now.Some people are saying that the matter should be decided in a referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
