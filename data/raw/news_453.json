While abortion advocates argue that such abortions are \u201cextremely rare,\u201d statistics recorded by a longtime Colorado abortionist shed light on the late term abortions performed at one Boulder clinic.\nThe data reveals hundreds of late-term abortions performed over a 20-year period on babies with fetal abnormalities such as Down syndrome.\nWarren Hern, an abortionist who has been active in Boulder, Colorado since 1975, released a paper in 2014 which included many self-reported statistics about the abortions his clinic performed between 1992 and 2012.\nThe statistics\u00a0show that Hern\u2019s clinic performed hundreds of abortions between 1992-2012 on women who were at or past 24 weeks pregnant, including several performed on women between 38 and 39 weeks gestation.\nNearly 240 of those late-term abortions were performed on babies with Down syndrome.\nThe self-reported statistics only cover abortions Hern performed for reasons of fetal abnormality, which in some years made up just 2.5% of the thousands of abortions he performed.- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nColorado remains one of the only a handful of states that does not have some legislation on\u00a0 late-term abortion. As a result, abortions can take place in the state up until birth.\nThe Boulder Abortion Clinic is one of just a handful of clinics in the U.S. that publicly accept patients seeking late-term abortions from anywhere in the world.\nColorado voters are set to decide on Proposition 115 in November, which asks voters whether to ban abortion in the state after 22 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases where a mother\u2019s life is threatened.\nMore than\u00a0150,000 Coloradans signed a petition\u00a0to put Prop. 115 on the ballot, which has\u00a0garnered bipartisan support.\nA poll conducted in early October\u00a0by 9 News / Colorado Politics found that among 1,021 registered likely voters, 42% of respondents said they are certain to vote yes on Prop. 115; 45% said no, while 13% are uncertain.\nIf the late-term abortion ban passes in November, it would mark the first time since 1967 that Colorado would impose voter-approved restrictions on abortion.\nWhile\u00a0some abortion supporters claim\u00a0the phrase \u201clate-term abortion\u201d is \u201cimprecise and misleading,\u201d Hern uses the term \u201clate abortion\u201d throughout his paper.\nHern reports that between Jan. 4, 1992 and Oct. 31, 2012, just more than 1,000 women requested a \u201clate abortion\u201d for reasons of fetal disorder.\nAbortion supporters frequently cite\u00a0CDC data\u00a0from 2016\u2014 data which excludes abortion hotspots like California, Illinois, New York state, and Washington DC\u2014 to argue that abortions after 21 weeks gestation make up only 1.2% of all abortions performed in the US and are thus \u201cextremely rare.\u201d\nIn Colorado, the percentage of abortions performed after 21 weeks is higher than the national average, at 3.3%\u2014 a figure higher than any other state in the CDC\u2019s data except New Mexico.\nThe statistics do not account for the fact that women have traveled from other states to Boulder for decades to avail themselves of Hern\u2019s late-term abortion services. At least 11% of all abortions performed in Colorado are on out-of-state residents, according to the CDC data.\u00a0\u00a0\nEach year, about 200 to 300 babies are aborted after 21 weeks gestation in Colorado. Dilation and evacuation abortions are typically used in the second trimester of pregnancy, and result in the crushing of the head and eventual dismemberment of an unborn child.\nThe trend in Hern\u2019s statistics suggest that the proportion of all patients seeking abortions because of fetal disorders increased over time from 2.5% to 30%.\nHern credited this increase to \u201cgradual change in clinic policy to accept patients with more advanced gestations, more requests for late termination of pregnancy because of fewer options being available elsewhere, and advances in fetal diagnosis.\u201d\n\u201cGenetic disorders\u201d\u2014 as opposed to \u201cstructural anomalies\u201d\u2014 were the most common disorders among the babies aborted, appearing in 40% of cases.\nOf those cases, 63% of the genetic disorders were Trisomy 21, commonly known as Down syndrome. Hern reported 237 total abortions of babies with Down syndrome.\nThe most common \u201cstructural anomalies\u201d reported were neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida; but some of the babies were aborted for reasons such as extra fingers or toes, cleft hands or lips, or because two twins were conjoined.\u00a0\nThe median age of all 1,005 patients in Hern\u2019s study was 32, and the median gestational age was 24 weeks, or five and a half months. He said many patients who request abortions after 30 weeks have had their fetus evaluated as \u201cnormal\u201d around 18 to 20 weeks.\nPatients seeking particular kinds of abortions at Hern\u2019s clinic tended to request abortions, on average, around eight months into their pregnancies.\nFor example, some patients carrying twins requested an abortion for one of the twins\u2014\u201cselective termination\u201d\u2014 usually because of a fetal abnormality.\nHern writes that in these cases, the abortions were generally done after 32 weeks\u2014 more than seven months\u2014 gestation to \u201cpermit optimum development and survival probability for the healthy twin.\u201d\nPatients seeking \u201cselective termination\u201d or \u201cinduced fetal demise\u201d\u2014 an injection to kill the fetus before the abortion operation\u2014 tended to be in their mid-30s in age. Hern said these patients typically request abortions between 33 and 36 weeks\u2014 over eight months\u2014 gestation.\nSeveral of his patients suffered major complications, including major unintended surgery, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and pelvic infection, he reported.\nA Nebraska couple filed a lawsuit against Hern and the Boulder Abortion Clinic in 2015, alleging that Hern left a nearly two-inch piece of a fetus\u2019 skull inside a patient\u2019s uterus during a late-term abortion, apparently forcing a patient to undergo a hysterectomy.\nIn 2016, Hern was the subject of a congressional investigation into the practices of late-term abortionists. The panel requested information on any infants who were born alive at his clinic and the babies\u2019 records thereafter. According to the Denver Post, Hern refused to provide any of the requested documentation, calling the panel a \u201cwitchhunt.\u201d\nDuring May 2019, Hern argued in a New York Times op-ed that because women are more likely to die in childbirth than from complications related to an abortion, \u201cpregnancy is dangerous; abortion can be lifesaving.\u201d\nDr. Mary Jo O\u2019Sullivan, a high-risk obstetrician and Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Miami,\u00a0responded at the time\u00a0that although any pregnancy carries some risk, it is not a \u201cserious\u201d threat to a woman\u2019s health, especially in the United States where maternal deaths are still very rare, even in rural areas.\nOpponents of Colorado\u2019s late-term abortion ban, including groups like Abortion Access for All, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America\u00a0have raised millions of dollars\u00a0to attempt to defeat the proposition.\nIf the ballot measure becomes law, doctors would face a three-year license suspension for performing or attempting to perform an abortion of an unborn child beyond 22-weeks of gestation. Women would not be charged with seeking or obtaining an abortion.\nThe Catholic bishops of Colorado asked voters to support the ban in a June 30 letter and placed the ballot measure under the patronage of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, also known as Mother Cabrini, who aided orphans and immigrants in her time in Colorado.\nIn addition, the\u00a0Catholic Medical Association and a group of more than 130 medical professionals and scientists\u00a0in Colorado have backed Proposition 115.\nColorado was the first state in the nation to decriminalize abortion. The initial legislation, signed into law April 25, 1967, allowed abortion in certain limited cases: rape, incest, or a prediction of permanent mental or physical disability of either the child or mother. Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Roe v. Wade declared abortion a constitutional right nationwide.\nAbortion-rights groups in Colorado have touted the fact that for a time during the pandemic, many women from other states were traveling to Colorado to take advantage of the state\u2019s permissive abortion laws.\nAbortion clinics in states like Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico, which did not introduce any pandemic-related restrictions on abortion, saw increases in patients traveling from other states, such as Texas, to undergo the procedure during spring 2020.\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinPinterestEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n\n\n\nPrevious articleQ&A: Despite the pandemic, Annunciation Heights continues to joyfully fulfill its missionNext article2020 Catholic Voter Guide\n\nCatholic News Agency\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nQ&A: Inaugural March for Life Colorado happening April 12\n\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeast Days  \n\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day: History, spirituality and traditions\n\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nPerpetual adoration chapels abound in the Archdiocese of Denver.
