(02-08-2022)\u00a0\u2013 On Valentine\u2019s Day, Students for Life of America, the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization, will co-host a news conference along with Heritage Action featuring national pro-life leaders engaged in protecting life not only in law but also in service. In preparation for a Post-Roe\u00a0America, pro-life leaders and activists are sharing their commitment to ensure that mothers and their children,\u00a0born and preborn, have the help they need. Leaders will discuss how they partner with young families, while Students for Life will highlight\u00a0StandingWithYou.org, which has been relaunched with more robust technologic capabilities after 10-years of service as a powerful resource compiling free, local, nonviolent resources available to women nationwide. These resources include healthcare, food assistance, housing, childcare, information about pregnant and parenting rights on campus, and in the workplace, and more so that no woman in an unplanned pregnancy stands alone and is instead connected to the life-giving, non-violent alternatives to abortion available in her area.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMEDIA ADVISORY:\u00a0Attendance at the event is invite only and non-transferable.

They sell women short, and then they sell them an abortion, creating real fear in women. We want women to know that we are already working to help them, and that no woman needs to stand alone.\u201d\u00a0\nClick\u00a0here to read Ruth\u2019s story at Fox\u00a0or\u00a0watch a video\u00a0of how she was helped by SFLA\u2019s\u00a0Standing With You\u00a0initiative.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor interviews, contact Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0or \u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201330\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life Action (SFLAction),\u00a0a 501c4, along with its\u00a0501c3\u00a0sister organization,\u00a0Students for Life of America (SFLA),\u00a0make up the nation\u2019s largest pro-life youth organization and a political and policy operation engaging people of all ages.
