Sponsored by the international movement 40 Days for Life, the event marked the start of a five-week campaign seeking to end abortion through prayer, fasting and outreach that also coincides with the Catholic Church\u2019s observance of Respect Life Month in the United States. (Photo by Gina Christian)\nBy Gina Christian \u2022 Posted October 2, 2020 A five-week pro-life campaign was launched in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia last week as the Catholic Church in the United States celebrates Respect Life Month, the annual October observance that focuses on upholding human dignity at all stages of life.\nSome 50 participants gathered Sept. 23 at the Center City Philadelphia location of Planned Parenthood for a candlelight vigil organized by 40 Days for Life. The global movement, which is active in 63 countries since its founding in 2007, advocates for an end to abortion through prayer, fasting, vigils and community outreach.\n[hotblock]\n\u201cWe started praying here at eight o\u2019clock this morning,\u201d said Patrick Stanton, co-chair of the organization\u2019s Philadelphia chapter and a board member of the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia. \u201cAnd this is going to continue for 40 days.\u201d\nStatistics down, but racial divides up\nStanton said some 4,000 abortions are performed each year at the downtown Planned Parenthood site, with an estimated 6,500 taking place at the Women\u2019s Center, a separate abortion facility in the city\u2019s Chinatown section.\nAlthough abortions have declined significantly, he said, the numbers are still \u201cterrible.\u201d\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, abortion rates in the U.S. reached a historic low in 2017, when approximately 862,320 (or 13.5 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44) were performed. That figure marked an 8% drop from 2014 totals.\n[tower]\nOverall, women of color are disproportionately affected by abortion, with Guttmacher reporting that in 2014, Black and Hispanic clients combined accounted for 53% of the U.S. women seeking abortions.\nThose numbers are an everyday reality for vigil attendee Marlene Dowling, director of the Philadelphia-based HOPE Pregnancy Center.\n\u201cI work in North Philadelphia, an area that is predominantly African American,\u201d said Dowling, a Black mother of two who disclosed that she herself had two abortions.\nStanton described Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger as a \u201ceugenicist and racist\u201d who sought to eliminate groups she considered undesirable.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reported on Sanger\u2019s testimony, her exact words: \u2018We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,\u2019\u201d Stanton said, quoting a 1939 letter in which Sanger detailed her efforts to counter what she called the \u201cignorance, superstition and doubts\u201d of Blacks regarding contraception and abortion.\nStanton said the Black population \u2014 \u201cwhich should be around 15% to 20% right now\u201d and which the Census Bureau currently estimates at 13.4% \u2014 has been \u201cdecimated by abortion.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to see racism, it\u2019s right there,\u201d said Stanton.\nProviding resources\nPoverty and lack of social service supports, two consequences of systemic racism, often drive pregnant women to consider abortion, said Dowling.\nThe Sisters of Life participated in a Sept. 27 Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul that marked the start of the 40 Days for Life campaign, which seeks to end abortion through prayer, fasting and community outreach. Prior to the liturgy, which was celebrated by Archbishop Nelson P\u00e9rez, the sisters led a holy hour for life. (Sarah Webb)\n\u201cThey feel that they have to do it, because it\u2019s so much of a stress, and they\u2019re thinking, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t take care of myself, so how can I take care of someone else?\u2019\u201d said Dowling. \u201cBut there are resources that are available to them that they may not know of, and that I can provide for them.\u201d\nAs a society, she added, \u201cwe have to step up\u201d in comprehensively caring for pregnant women and new mothers.\nAbortion \u201cis not just a problem of the person who is thinking about it,\u201d said Dowling. \u201cIt\u2019s our problem, and we have to begin to know that and do something about it.\u201d\nThat proactive approach is essential to the 40 Days for Life movement, said vigil keynote speaker Matt Britton, a board member and general counsel for the organization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our neighbor, it\u2019s not the government, it\u2019s us,\u201d said Britton. \u201cStop looking around and look in the mirror.\u201d\nBritton, whose talk was frequently interrupted by an unidentified female heckler, also encouraged attendees to undertake their witness and outreach \u201cwith love.\u201d\nPro-Life Union communications coordinator Anna Roper agreed, saying the vigil and campaign were intended to mark \u201ca healing moment for the city.\u201d\nDr. Monique Ruberu (center), co-chair of the Philadelphia 40 Days for Life group, prays with her family during a Sept. 27 Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul that marked the start of the five-week vigil to end abortion. (Sarah Webb)\n\u201cAbortion is a violent act\u201d that damages both baby and mother, said Roper, citing the grief, depression and shame experienced by many women after undergoing an abortion.\nSuch effects (known in mental health terms as \u201csequelae\u201d) can be compounded by lack of widespread recognition for an actual post-abortion syndrome, Roper noted.\n\u201cSo you feel like you should be sad for this, but people are telling you that you shouldn\u2019t be sad,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of confusion mixed up in there, and they probably just don\u2019t know where to go, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u2018For a moment, you almost weren\u2019t born\u2019\nOffering hope to women in crisis pregnancies is part of the church\u2019s mission, said Archbishop Nelson P\u00e9rez, who celebrated a Sept. 27 Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul in honor of the 40 Days for Life campaign. The liturgy was preceded by a holy hour led by the Sisters of Life.\nSpeaking to some 350 attendees, Archbishop P\u00e9rez recounted a moving experience from his days as a Philadelphia priest, when he found a pregnant young woman waiting for him one morning on his office doorstep.\nShunned by her family, \u201cshe really felt she had no options\u201d other than abortion, said the archbishop.\nArchbishop Nelson P\u00e9rez blesses faithful at a Mass he celebrated Sept. 27 at the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul to mark the start of the 40 Days for Life campaign, which coincides with Respect Life Month in the U.S. (Sarah Webb)\nAfter connecting her with pregnancy and parenting resources, \u201cshe was able to make it through and bring that boy to life, to the world,\u201d said Archbishop P\u00e9rez, who sees both mother and son on occasion.\n\u201cI look at that young guy, her only son, and I think, \u2018For a moment there, you almost weren\u2019t born,\u2019\u201d he said.\nWhen the mother had needed childcare for her infant, then-Father P\u00e9rez put her in touch with a former parishioner \u2013 one who, during a chance encounter at a train station, had unwittingly consoled the woman as she had wept over her unplanned pregnancy.\nAt the conclusion of the liturgy, obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Monique Ruberu related a dramatic intervention, made possible by a 40 Days for Life volunteer, that also saved an unborn child.\nHaving seen the volunteer displaying a sign on abortion pill reversal options, a pregnant woman who had ingested the medication was eventually able to get in touch with Dr. Ruberu.\nAfter prescribing the reversal treatment, Dr. Ruberu \u2013 a co-chair of the Philadelphia 40 Days for Life group \u2013 later delivered the woman\u2019s healthy child.\n\u201cThat child might not have been there if that amazing prayer warrior did not make the choice\u201d to peacefully demonstrate before the abortion clinic, said Dr. Ruberu. \u201cWe must stand up for life at all costs. We have no choice.\u201d\n\u2018And that day will come\u2019\nArchbishop P\u00e9rez said that abortion, gun violence and racial divisions underscored that \u201cthe sacredness of life, whether it\u2019s a full-grown adult or a child in the womb, has become cheap.\u201d\nThe devaluation of human dignity is directly tied to the legalization of abortion, he said.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t respect life, in its most vulnerable and defenseless form, in the womb of the mother, then \u2026 everything\u2019s up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t defend life in the womb, then what can we hope for outside of the womb?\u201d\nHe stressed that \u201cthe right to life is not a political issue; it\u2019s a moral issue.\u201d\nAdmitting that the pro-life stance is \u201cnot a popular position these days in some circles,\u201d the archbishop urged faithful to remain \u201csteadfast\u201d in their efforts to oppose abortion.\n\u201cThis is a month to pray, to fast and to sacrifice so that someday\u201d the practice of abortion will be ended, said Archbishop P\u00e9rez, adding, \u201cand that day will come \u2026 because God will do what God will do.\u201d\n***\nFollow Christian on Twitter at @GinaJesseReina.\n\n\nJoin the CatholicPhilly.com family\nCatholicPhilly.com\u00a0works to strengthen the connections between people, families and communities every day by delivering the news people need to know about the Catholic Church, especially in the Philadelphia region, and the world in which we live.\nBy your donation in any amount, you and hundreds of other people become part of our mission to inform, form in the Catholic faith and inspire the thousands of readers who visit every month.\nHere is how you can help:\n\nA $100 gift allows us to present award-winning photos of Catholic life in our neighborhoods.\nA $50 gift enables us to cover a news event in a local parish, school or Catholic institution.\nA $20 gift lets us obtain solid faith formation resources that can deepen your spirituality and knowledge of the faith.\nA small, automated monthly donation means you can support us continually and easily.\n\nWon't you consider making a gift today?\nPlease join in the church's vital mission of communications by offering a gift in whatever amount that you can \u2015 a single gift of $40, $50, $100, or more, or a monthly donation.
