[+] Austin, Texas.The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court, which is made up entirely of Republicans, unanimously ruled that officials at state medical licensing boards can\u2019t enforce Texas\u2019 Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), which prohibits nearly all abortions after approximately six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\nSB 8 directs private citizens to enforce the ban through lawsuits against anyone who \u201caids and abets\u201d an abortion in the state, so the court ruled that state officials like those at medical licensing boards can\u2019t take any action themselves to enforce it.\n\n\n\nAbortion providers had argued that the licensing officials could be held liable, because they could punish doctors and nurses that perform abortions in violation of the law.\n\n\n\nProviders had initially sued a range of state officials in an effort to block the law, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the lawsuit could only move forward against the licensing officials and not the others.\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court then sent the case back to a federal appeals court, which asked the Texas Supreme Court to rule on whether the licensing officials could be sued under state law (rather than federal law, as the U.S. Supreme Court considered).\n\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the abortion providers in the lawsuit, acknowledged in a statement Friday the ruling means the federal appeals court will throw out their lawsuit and SB 8 \u201cwill likely remain in effect for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Watch For\nThe Texas Supreme Court ruling means abortion providers do not have a clear legal path forward to challenge SB 8, as courts have now blocked the providers from suing every defendant they had named. Other challenges to SB 8 are moving through the state court that more narrowly consider whether anti-abortion advocates can sue individual parties under the law, but rulings in those cases would only apply to those parties rather than block the law statewide.\nChief Critic\n\u201cWith this ruling, the sliver of this case that we were left with is gone,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThe courts have allowed Texas to nullify a constitutional right. We will continue to do everything in our power to right this wrong.\u201d\n\nKey Background\nSB 8 went into effect September 1 as the most extreme abortion restriction in the U.S. While similar abortion restrictions have been blocked in court, SB 8 was crafted to evade judicial scrutiny through its lawsuit enforcement mechanism, which was designed to make it difficult to name defendants who could actually be blocked from enforcing the law. Friday\u2019s ruling marks the latest instance of that strategy succeeding, after the U.S. Supreme Court twice ruled against the abortion providers and also threw out a lawsuit brought by the Biden administration that sought to block the policy. Though a district court judge briefly blocked the policy in response to the federal government\u2019s lawsuit, an appeals court then swiftly overturned that ruling.\nSurprising Fact\nResearchers at the University of Texas at Austin found SB 8 hasn\u2019t actually affected abortion rates as much as anti-abortion advocates had hoped in the six months since it\u2019s taken effect, as those seeking abortions in the state have largely obtained them through other means, like medication abortion or traveling out of state for the procedure. Abortions in the state had only decreased by approximately 10%, the studies found\u2014though anti-abortion rights advocates told the New York Times they considered any reduction in cases to be a win.\nTangent\nThe Texas abortion law\u2014and courts\u2019 tacit acceptance of it\u2014has already inspired a host of copycat bills nationwide. Legislative chambers in Idaho and Oklahoma have recently passed their own versions of the Texas law, and a new bill introduced in Missouri would even go far beyond it, using SB 8\u2019s enforcement mechanism to also prohibit Missourians from seeking abortions out of state. Other states have also adopted SB 8\u2019s lawsuit provision for other political issues, such as a California bill that allows civil lawsuits against firearm manufacturers and distributors.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nTexas Supreme Court weighs challenge to state's restrictive abortion law (Austin American-Statesman)\nSix months in, \u201cno end in sight\u201d for Texas\u2019 new abortion law (Texas Tribune)\nTexas Abortion Law Sent To State Supreme Court \u2014 Here\u2019s Why That Could Kill Abortion Providers\u2019 Case (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Alison DurkeeEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
