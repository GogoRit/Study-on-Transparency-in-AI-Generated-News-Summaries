Newsroom, Aug 10, 2022 / 05:00 am\nGrace Hartsock was knocking on doors to encourage Kansas citizens to vote for a pro-life amendment when, she says, she was attacked.\nThe 18-year-old from Austin, Texas \u2014 a rising freshman at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas \u2014 walked away from one house after encountering a woman who opposed the amendment. That is when she heard \u201cyelling and cursing\u201d coming from inside, she told CNA.\n\u201cAs I was walking back towards the street, the woman\u2019s adult daughter came out of the house, still yelling, and started following me,\u201d Hatsock recalled of the July 31 incident in Leawood, Kansas. \u201cShe pushed me with both hands, and hit me with her fists.\u201d\nStudents for Life Action, the pro-life group with which Hartsock was canvassing, claimed in a blog post that the woman \u201cshoved Hartsock in the chest with both hands and began violently hitting her in the head with closed fists.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Hartsock reached the end of the driveway, she said the woman threw a dinner roll at her and continued to follow her as she yelled \u201cI hope you get raped\u201d and \u201cI hope you get run over by a car.\u201d\nStudents for Life later shared a 5-second clip that it said showed the woman who assaulted Hartsock. In the video, a woman shouts \u201cf*** you\u201d as she sticks her middle finger in the air. Another woman, in the background, instructs her to \u201cstop it!\u201d\n\nThe audio also captures the panting of the person holding the camera.\nCapt. Brad Robbins at the Leawood Police Department confirmed that an 18-year-old female contacted them about the incident on July 31 just after 2 p.m.\n\u201cShe stated that an hour earlier she had been going door-to-door representing Students for Life,\u201d he told CNA in a statement. \u201cAt one address in the 11200 block of Granada Lane the victim was advised they did not wish to discuss the issue. As she was walking away from the address, she was yelled at and then struck by a female resident.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the police investigation, Robbins said that a 37-year-old suspect was arrested and charged in Leawood Municipal Court with misdemeanor battery and released.\n\u201cWhile an arrest has been made, it is still consider[ed] an open investigation and we will not be releasing any additional details of the event,\u201d he said.\nRobbins said that the victim was not visibly injured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Hartsock had a headache after being hit in the head, the local emergency room confirmed that she suffered from no serious injuries, she said. She added that, at the time, she also felt \u201cnervous and shaken up.\u201d\nShe shared what she would tell her alleged attacker, if she had the opportunity.\n\u201cI would tell her that rather than being \u2018pro-woman\u2019 as the pro-abortion movement claims to be, she is showing the world with her actions just how anti-woman she really is,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the hypocrisy of the pro-abortion side. Rather than being pro-woman, they condone violence against pro-life women just because we disagree with their narrative.\u201d\nRather than being discouraged, Hartsock said that the incident left her even more motiviated in her pro-life advocacy, adding that \u201cwe as pro-lifers need to be more courageous than ever in not backing down and standing up to defend the vulnerable women and children in our communities.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nA Catholic, she said the faith and science support her pro-life position.\n\u201cWhile I am a faithful Catholic, and the Catholic Church teaches that all human life is made in the image and likeness of God,\u201d she said, \u201cI am pro-life because science shows that life begins at conception, where a unique human being comes into existence.\u201d\nHartsock\u2019s alleged attack is not an isolated one, according to Autumn Schimmer, the project manager at Students for Life of America.\n\u201cI was punched outside of the Supreme Court in September of 2020 while protesting a NARAL rally that was being held opposing the nomination of Justice Barrett to the Supreme Court,\u201d she told CNA of a protest held by a pro-abortion group.\u00a0\nShe called violent attacks on pro-life advocates a \u201cgrowing concern,\u201d from the recent attacks at pregnancy centers to threats targeting Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to Grace in Kansas is unfortunately becoming more common in a post-Roe America,\u201d Schimmer said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that previously legalized abortion nationwide. \u201cPro-life advocates should be aware of the violent acts pro-abortion supports are willing to carry out, without being fully deterred from advocating for the preborn and their mothers.\u201d\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nStudents for Life, \nValue Them Both\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
