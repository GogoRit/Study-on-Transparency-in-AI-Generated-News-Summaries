This was a bit of a faux pas: a moment of letting slip the mask that the anti-abortion movement always tries to keep on.Alabama\u2019s abortion ban, which has only limited exemptions for women\u2019s lives, makes providing an abortion a felony, punishable by up to 99 years in prison. But like nearly all of the abortion bans that have sprung into effect since the US supreme court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health overturned Roe v Wade last June, the law has no mechanism to prosecute women who receive abortions. But that doesn\u2019t mean that patients are safe from criminal charges, according to the state\u2019s top prosecutor.We were told abortion wasn\u2019t an important election issue. How wrong that was | Moira DoneganRead more\u201cThe Human Life Protection Act targets abortion providers, exempting women upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed from liability under the law,\u201d a spokesperson for attorney general Marshall told Alabama\u2019s 1819 News, referring to the law that bans abortion itself. However, he continued, \u201cIt does not provide an across-the-board exemption from all criminal laws.\u201dIn other words, just because the Alabama abortion ban specifically doesn\u2019t allow prosecutors to go after women who have had abortions, doesn\u2019t mean that those women will not be arrested and jailed for their procedures. It just means that the prosecutors will have to find another law.Which other law? The AG pointed to one in particular: Alabama\u2019s law barring the so-called \u201cchemical endangerment of a child\u201d. The law, which was originally designed to protect kids from exposure to home meth labs, makes it a felony to \u201cknowingly, recklessly, or intentionally cause or permit a child to be exposed to, to ingest or inhale, or to have contact with any controlled substance, chemical substance, or drug paraphernalia\u201d. The Alabama state supreme court ruled in 2013 that the law can be applied to \u201cchildren\u201d who have not been born yet \u2013 that is, embryos and fetuses.What does it mean in practice? It means that legally, a pregnancy is defined as a \u201cperson\u201d, and a woman\u2019s body becomes an \u201cenvironment\u201d that she has an obligation to keep free of hazards, in deference to the wellbeing of this other \u201cperson\u201d. This is how the Alabama AG is threatening to lock up abortion patients: by defining women\u2019s bodies not as spheres of those women\u2019s own control, but as homes to house other people \u2013 and by defining abortion pills as hazardous \u201cdrugs\u201d.None of this is new. The truth is that chemical endangerment laws have long been used to criminalize pregnancy, and Alabama in particular has a long, sadistic history of prosecuting women who are pregnant \u2013 or believed to be pregnant \u2013 on suspicion that they have ingested something that might endanger a fetus.Marijuana users and those seeking opiate addiction treatment have been arrested for supposedly endangering their fetuses in the state; in one county, the imprisonment of pregnant women on chemical endangerment charges or suspicion of drug use became so common that Pregnancy Justice, a national advocacy group that provides lawyers to those prosecuted for their pregnancy outcomes, had a whole project dedicated to getting women out of the county jail.The substances that women are arrested for taking need not be illegal. Sometimes, they are prescriptions. In 2021, Alabama arrested a mother of six under a felony chemical endangerment charge after she refilled her longstanding painkiller prescription while pregnant (the woman, named Kim Blalock, had an old back injury from a car accident). Charges were eventually dropped, but not before Blalock had her home raided by armed police, who scared her children and was dragged through court for months. Her pregnancy, by the way, was fine: amid all the antagonism from her state, Blalock gave birth to a healthy baby boy.But the comments from the Alabama AG do reveal a new trend in the anti-abortion movement: abortion opponents are being increasingly frank about their own sadism. The newest abortion bans gaining traction in the states have no exemptions for rape or incest; some, like those of Idaho and Tennessee, have no life of the mother exemptions, or require doctors to prove the medical necessity of an abortion after the fact, in court \u2013 provisions that incentivize medical providers to delay or deny care, to risk women\u2019s health and lives.For all the efforts of abortion opponents to put a paternalistic spin on their work, these positions are not anomalies; they are now firmly in the anti-abortion mainstream. In that sense, Marshall was just being honest: hurting women has always been the point.\nMoira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist\n This article was amended on 13 January 2023 to reflect the fact that the name of the woman arrested for chemical endangerment is Kim Blalock. An earlier version had named a different woman.Explore more on these topicsAbortionOpinionWomencommentShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsCartoonsOpinion videosLettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
