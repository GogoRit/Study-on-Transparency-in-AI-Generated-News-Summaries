\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            The South Carolina Republican-led Senate was unable to pass a bill Thursday that sought to ban nearly all abortions at every stage of pregnancy without exceptions for rape and incest, instead choosing to amend the state\u2019s already restrictive abortion law, after a handful of GOP senators joined with Democrats to block the bill.\n    \n\n            The failure of the near-total abortion ban spoke to the divide among South Carolina Republicans \u2013 and the chasm among Republicans in general \u2013 over whether abortion restrictions should include exceptions for pregnancies that were the result of a rape or incest.\n    \n\n            South Carolina House bill 5399, which passed the state House last month, had enough support from Senate Republicans to ban nearly all abortions in the state, but a filibuster on Thursday from GOP state Sen. Tom Davis stopped it in its tracks. Republicans did not have the votes to overcome a filibuster and proceed to a vote on the bill, which requires a higher threshold of votes. \n    \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m not going to let this (bill) come to a vote unless this body votes and sits me down,\u201d Davis said on the Senate floor Thursday night.\n    \n\n            Unable to pass the restrictive bill, Republicans instead took up an amendment that struck the bill\u2019s language and inserted language to change the state\u2019s existing six-week ban on abortion. That ban has been blocked by the South Carolina Supreme Court from being enforced after taking effect shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned. As a state court continues to review that law, the state\u2019s 2016 law that bans abortions 20 weeks after conception is currently in effect. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina State Senator Tom Davis reacts after the Senate passed a new ban on abortion at the state legislature in Columbia, South Carolina, U.S. September 8, 2022.  \n\nSam Wolfe/Reuters\n\n\n\n            In introducing the amendment, state Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, a Republican, conceded that the \u201cvotes are not there in the Senate right now to have an abortion ban earlier than six weeks.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cI hate that I have to admit that,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou got to have the votes to pass it, and we unfortunately do not.\u201d  \n    \n\n            \u201cThis is not where I wanted to be. I was hoping we\u2019d do something pretty aggressive in response to Dobbs,\u201d Massey said in introducing his amendment. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to make progress. This amendment is definitely progress.\u201d\n    \n\n            He claimed the amendment would \u201cshore up\u201d the South Carolina law, S.1, against the legal challenges and correct the issues that the state Supreme Court identified as an ambiguity with the law. He argued that if the law isn\u2019t fixed, South Carolina will be \u201cabortion on demand.\u201d\n    \n\n            S. 1 bans abortions once what it calls a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is detected, which can be as early as four weeks, and more commonly, six weeks into pregnancy. \n    \n\n            Massey\u2019s amendment maintains the exceptions to the ban for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest, but shortens the time frame. The law currently allows exceptions to the ban for rape or incest if the \u201cprobable post-fertilization age of the fetus\u201d is fewer than 20 weeks. The amendment would allow an exception for rape or incest up to the first trimester, which is up until about 14 weeks.\n    \n\n            Several senators on the floor Thursday took issue with two subsections of the amendment, which state that fatal fetal abnormalities would require a diagnosis by two separate physicians before an abortion could be performed, and that a physician performing the abortion \u201cshall preserve a DNA sample from the fetal remains and notify the sheriff in the county in which the abortion was performed.\u201d A sheriff must then retrieve and store the sample in evidence for 90 days, so that the perpetrator of the rape might be prosecuted.\n    \n\n            Massey\u2019s amendment was adopted by a voice vote.\n    \n\n            The bill has been sent back to the South Carolina House of Representatives, which will decide whether to accept the changes.\n    \n\n    Republicans divided\n\n\n            House bill 5399, when it was first brought to the Senate on Wednesday, did not include exceptions for rape or incest, or fatal fetal anomalies. Davis had introduced several amendments over the two days to add back in the exceptions and was successful in getting an exemption for fatal fetal anomalies back into the bill.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI made some headway yesterday in making a bad bill better, but it\u2019s nowhere near the point where I can support it,\u201d Davis said Thursday. \n    \n\n            \u201cAnd I recognize to a significant degree that I\u2019m breaking with my Republican brethren,\u201d he added. \n    \n\n            Republican members were deeply divided over whether the bill should include these exceptions \u2013 with all three of the Senate\u2019s female GOP members speaking out strongly against the bill Wednesday morning. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina State Senator Katrina Frye Shealy listens while debating a new ban on abortion at the state legislature in Columbia, South Carolina, U.S. September 8, 2022.  \n\nSam Wolfe/Reuters\n\n\n\n            \u201cIf you want to believe that God is wanting you to push a bill through with no exception that kills mothers and ruins the lives of children, let\u2019s mothers bring home babies to bury them, then I think you\u2019re miscommunicating with God or maybe you\u2019re just not communicating with him at all,\u201d Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy said Wednesday in a fiery speech on the Senate floor directed toward her male colleagues.\n    \n\n            \u201cI know we disagree on a lot of issues, but hearing you talk about menstrual cycles, conception, how you know when your egg is fertilized or having a baby, I got to tell you it really disgusts me.\u201d\n    \n\n            Shealy added: \u201cYes, I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m also pro-life with the mother, the life she has with her children who are already born. I care about the children who are forced into adulthood that was made up by a legislature full of men so they can make take a victory lap and feel good about it. You want children raising children who will most likely suffer domestic violence and live in poverty. But you don\u2019t care because you\u2019ve done your job and you will forget about them once they are born.\u201d\n    \n\n            Fellow GOP Sen. Sandy Senn also predicted that women would turn out in droves in the November election to vote on the issue of abortion, while also calling for the issue to be placed on the ballot. \n    \n\n            Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson called on lawmakers \u201cto face reality y\u2019all. We don\u2019t live in Dark Ages.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThis is not simply a moral decision. And I\u2019m not advocating for abortion on demand and I\u2019m not advocating for abortion as birth control, but there are more considerations that must be undertaken,\u201d she said on the Senate floor in arguing for exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies.\n    \n\n            Lawmakers on Thursday also declined to amend H. 5399 so its text would be replaced with a joint resolution that would propose a ballot measure that would amend the constitution to recognize a \u201cright of bodily integrity and autonomy that includes a limited right to abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n            Conservative Republican Rep. Josiah Magnuson, who backed the bill, told CNN that it\u2019s \u201cembarrassing\u201d that the Senate failed to pass a abortion ban as \u201cmost of these Republicans ran on strong pro-life\u201d platforms.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pass a bill that truly protects every innocent life,\u201d he argued. He said conservative Republicans would be willing to go along with what lawmakers can do to restrict abortion, but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the best we can get.\u201d Magnuson said he supports voting down the Senate changes to the bill, which if the House chooses to do so would send the legislation to a conference committee.\n    \n\n            After the US Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, a South Carolina House ad hoc committee met in July to put together a \u201cworking draft\u201d of H. 5399. \n    \n\n            The original bill as they drafted it sought to ban abortion at every stage of pregnancy without exceptions for rape or incest\u2013 which, like in the Senate, was a major point of contention among Republicans in the House.  \n    \n\n            Exceptions were limited to preventing the death of the pregnant woman, the substantial risk of death for the pregnant woman because of a physical condition or \u201cthe substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\u201d The bill had listed several medical conditions it deemed posed such a risk to the pregnant woman, including a molar pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia and a miscarriage. \n    \n\n            The House last week hastily added in an exception for cases of rape and incest up to 12 weeks after conception, with requirements to report the claim of rape or incest to law enforcement, before voting to advance the bill.   \n    \n\n            The Senate Medical Affairs Committee on Tuesday then removed the exception for rape and incest up to 12 weeks after conception, before advancing it to the full Senate. \n    \n\n            The Senate-amended bill will now need to be approved again by the House before it can be sent to the governor\u2019s desk. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis amended version does not advance the cause of life in [South Carolina] and I cannot concur with a bill that does nothing,\u201d the House ad hoc committee chair, Republican Rep. John McCravy, told CNN in an email. \u201cWe were not called back to pass a bill we already have \u2013 we were called to rewrite the laws of our state after the Dobbs decision.\u201d\n
