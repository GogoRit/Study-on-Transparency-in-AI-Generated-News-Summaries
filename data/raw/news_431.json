(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawyer representing eight Pennsylvania abortion providers faced a tough round of questioning from a slate of Commonwealth Court judges Wednesday.\nWomen\u2019s Law Project attorney Susan Frietsche argued on behalf of the abortion providers that the law that bans state Medicaid funding from paying for abortions violates the Pennsylvania constitution\u2019s equal rights amendment because it denies coverage for a medical procedure that can be used only by women.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that women have a right to a funded abortion,\u201d said Frietsche. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that if the commonwealth decides to fund health care, it must do so in accordance with gender equality standards. It must do so fairly.\u201d\nAttorneys for Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican senators, representatives and the Department of Human Services argued that the discrimination in this instance is based on a woman\u2019s choice to have an abortion, not the fact that she\u2019s a woman. Jason Snyderman, representing the senators, noted that Medical Assistance also does not cover in vitro fertilization or erectile dysfunction \u2014 two medical issues that are specific to sex.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHYY thanks our sponsors \u2014 become a WHYY sponsor\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because the impact is only felt by one or the other sex doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sex-based discrimination,\u201d said Snyderman.\nDavid Dye, the attorney for the House GOP representatives, added that precedent establishes that the government is allowed to pick and choose which policy determinations it wishes to fund based on what it believes are \u201cvaluable and laudable for society.\u201d\nAt the center of the case is the precedent set when a similar challenge was made in 1985. The court ruled in Fischer v. the Department of Public Welfare that the coverage ban does not violate the state ERA.\nBolstering the argument of the legislators and the Department of Human Services, Judge Patricia McCullough noted from the bench that in Fischer, the state Supreme Court outlined that the state\u2019s explicit priority is to encourage the birth of a child in all circumstances unless another life, i.e. that of the mother, is in danger. In other words, the justices ruled it was OK to prioritize childbirth coverage over abortion.\nFrietsche argued that where the Fischer ruling went wrong was in focusing too much on the federal Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion, and not enough on whether the ban violates the ERA, which only exists in state law.\nShe said if you can discriminate against women because of their reproductive capacity, that becomes very hard to distinguish from sex discrimination.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying once a government pays for health insurance, you\u2019re saying they must pay for every service?\u201d challenged President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt.\nFrietsche responded that the ban carves out a specific service of an otherwise comprehensive plan.\nOf the panel of nine judges, the four who asked questions were women.\nAmong objections voiced by the other side was whether the abortion providers had\u00a0 standing to challenge the funding ban. Matthew McLees argued for the Department of Human Services that the abortion providers did not demonstate a direct harm to them, and that any argument for financial hardship was invalid since they could simply choose not to offer abortions.\nFrietsche responded by saying that these providers offer 95% of abortions in the state; providing abortions is simply what they do, making their interests inextricably linked to the patients they are representing. She also noted that it is unreasonable to expect \u201cindigent\u201d women seeking abortions to come forward in a case like this \u2014 they have a strong privacy interest, and it\u2019s likely their pregnancies will be over by the time legal arguments are ever heard.\nIn a somewhat surprising move, Dye, the lawyer representing the House GOP representatives, also argued that withholding Medicaid funding for abortions could not be gender-based discrimination since transgender men can also become pregnant and would still be denied Medicaid coverage for abortions.\nUltimately, Frietsche acknowledged that the Commonwealth Court does not have the power to overturn Fischer v. the Department of Public Welfare, but said she hoped it would write an opinion describing why the state Supreme Court was wrong in 1985, prompting a closer look from the Supreme Court.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet daily updates from WHYY News!\n\nThe free WHYY News Daily newsletter delivers the most important local stories to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare thisFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nWHYY is your source for fact-based, in-depth journalism and information.
