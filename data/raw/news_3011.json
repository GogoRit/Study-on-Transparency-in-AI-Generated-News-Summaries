He was charged under the FACE Act the same day, after a federal indictment alleged that he assaulted a Planned Parenthood clinic escort in October 2021. A local case against him was dismissed because the plaintiff never showed up at court, a former spokesman for Houck told CNA.\nBreen contends that Houck was just defending his son, who was being harassed by a clinic escort. Breen told CNA that witness testimony and video evidence supports his claim. Neither as of yet is available to the public, he said.\nIf convicted under the FACE Act, Houck could face up to 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $350,000.\u00a0\nThe FACE Act \u201cprohibits violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services,\u201d according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolating the FACE Act is a federal crime and protects \u201call patients, providers, and facilities that provide reproductive health services, including pro-life pregnancy counseling services and any other pregnancy support facility providing reproductive health care,\u201d according to the DOJ.\n\u201cWe note that the pro-life viewpoint is a religiously based viewpoint on the part of Mark Houck. So it\u2019s an infringement on his religious rights to target him in this way,\u201d Breen said.\u00a0\nBreen said that the government\u2019s response to the motion is due Dec. 16.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we are really doing here \u2014 in a way that no one else has been able to do \u2014 is to put the Biden administration on trial,\u201d Breen said.\u00a0\nThe motion says that \u201cthe indisputable evidence shows that the government, under the Biden administration, has engaged in an overt pattern of aggressive enforcement of FACE against pro-life individuals while turning a blind eye to blatant violations by pro-abortion individuals.\u201d The full motion can be read here.\n\u201cWhen the DOJ sent 25 agents to Mark Houck\u2019s door, sidewalk counselors across the country heard the message. There was a message of intimidation. There was a message intended to strike fear in the hearts of sidewalk counselors across the country,\u201d Breen told CNA.\n\u201cWhy is it that they have sat silent and just been impotent in dealing with the incredible violence and vandalism that\u2019s occurred at pro-life pregnancy centers and churches?\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know full well that if over 150 abortion clinics had been vandalized or damaged in that way, you would have scores of people under arrest right now,\u201d he said.\nDozens of pro-abortion attacks on churches and pro-life pregnancy centers have occurred in the anticipation and aftermath of the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June. The 1973 landmark case federally legalized abortion across the nation.\nBreen said that the motion is \u201cthe first significant legal attack\u201d on the FACE Act since Roe was overturned in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case.\nHouck\u2019s trial is set for Jan. 24, 2023, at 9:30 a.m. in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nReligious discrimination, \nThomas More Society, \nAbortion in the United States, \nFACE Act, \nMark Houck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Bukuras is a journalist at the Catholic News Agency.\u00a0 Joe has prior experience working in state and federal government, in non-profits, and Catholic education.
