EFE / Bienvenido Velasco\n\n\n What value\u00a0do\u00a0human rights\u00a0have\u00a0for advancing protections related to sexuality in the current moment?\n\n\nBy\nSofia Gruskin\n\n\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\u00a0\r\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The last few years have seen unprecedented\u00a0progress\u00a0towards sexual\u00a0and reproductive\u00a0rights around the globe, at both societal and legal levels. The change from complete social stigma and invisibility to increasing public visibility and rights protections over the course of a few decades in countries across the globe has been nothing short of amazing. One need consider only the record number of countries that have decriminalized homosexuality; the growing recognition of sexual assault as a serious crime regardless of where it takes place and against whom; the decriminalization of heterosexual sex outside of marriage for persons over 18;\u00a0the\u00a0loosening of restrictions limiting\u00a0access to contraception and abortion services;\u00a0as well as the\u00a0recent\u00a0change to the International Classification of Diseases moving transgender\u00a0health\u00a0out of the chapter on mental and behavioural disorders into a new chapter on sexual health.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAt the same time,\u00a0the\u00a0huge and growing backlash\u00a0sometimes feels like a tidal wave. This includes government sanctioned, or tolerated, violence because of people\u2019s real or perceived sexual orientation\u00a0or gender identity, openly expressed articulations of\u00a0homophobia and transphobia by government officials, as well as retrenchment on commitments to comprehensive sexuality education, access to abortion and other reproductive rights\u00a0across every continent. Alongside these\u00a0actions\u00a0by\u00a0governments, sit\u00a0broader\u00a0ideological attacks\u00a0against gender equality and sexuality,\u00a0increased conservatism,\u00a0a lack of trust or support for multilateralism,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0growth in\u00a0fascist tendencies\u00a0and populist anger more generally.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nIt is this disconnect, and opportunities for synergy, that motivates this\u00a0series. What is the value of human rights for advancing protections related to sexuality in the current moment? As the pieces\u00a0will\u00a0show, the law is critical but\u00a0the organizing and rallying cry of human rights, beyond the rule of law, goes much further with the potential to bring different social movements together.\u00a0As\u00a0highlighted by these\u00a0authors,\u00a0human\u00a0rights\u2014built through theorization and practice globally\u2014function in two ways:\u00a0as\u00a0a law-based practice and\u00a0as\u00a0an act of\u00a0radical political imagination.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSexuality, and a person\u2019s ability to manifest their sexuality consensually,\u00a0is by now generally understood to be a matter of human rights, but it is nonetheless enmeshed in a wide variety of cultural norms, attitudes and values,\u00a0as well as\u00a0hostage to economic, social, legal and, in particular, political realities.\u00a0This collection makes clear the\u00a0need to think more deeply about the full social architecture that\u00a0can\u00a0support reproductive and sexual rights, and the need to fully\u00a0engage\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0economic, social, cultural, and political contexts that lie beneath the abstract expression of rights.\n\nWhat is the value of human rights for advancing protections related to sexuality in the current moment?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe last few months in particular have\u00a0exposed these\u00a0realities\u00a0in\u00a0new\u00a0ways. Even in this time of COVID,\u00a0it seems\u00a0sexual\u00a0and reproductive rights\u00a0remain\u00a0the target of backlash from right wing movements and governments,\u00a0even as they\u00a0continue\u00a0also\u00a0to be\u00a0at the forefront of expanding understanding and human rights protections across the globe.\u00a0As\u00a0authors in this series\u00a0remind us, COVID-19 has challenged not only health but rights worldwide, including sexual and reproductive rights, and we must recognize and address the fact that despite\u00a0recent\u00a0advances,\u00a0these rights in particular are vulnerable to regression.\n\n\nDespite\u00a0adequate\u00a0pre-existing\u00a0legal protections at international and domestic levels in\u00a0almost all countries of the world, consider:\u00a0the\u00a0increased use of\u00a0police power to enforce lockdowns\u00a0often at the expense of the very people they are expected to support resulting in\u00a0an upwelling\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0domestic violence;\u00a0increasingly limited access to\u00a0contraception, prenatal care and abortion services\u00a0because they are not deemed \u201cessential services\u201d;\u00a0and the ways in\u00a0which COVID -19 is serving as the excuse for\u00a0rights-regressive policies\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0adopted\u00a0by authoritarian governments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nConsider\u00a0Hungary\u2019 use of\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0to justify\u00a0passage of a law\u00a0making\u00a0it impossible for anyone who doesn\u2019t identify with the sex they were assigned at birth to\u00a0change their legal gender marker\u00a0to correspond to their identity.\u00a0Or the United States,\u00a0where the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortion services and\u00a0Christian anti-abortion lobbying organizations both received millions in Coronavirus stimulus money\u2014loans are forgiven for Christian advocacy groups,\u00a0but\u00a0must be paid back by those providing reproductive health care.\u00a0\n\n\nParticularly illustrative of these tensions\u00a0is\u00a0the recent change in Gabon, where in\u00a0early July\u00a0the Gabon Senate\u00a0decriminalized\u00a0same-sex sexual relations,\u00a0joining\u00a0the\u00a0growing list of countries to\u00a0remove criminal laws that target and discriminate against lesbians and gay men. But to be clear,\u00a0paragraph 5 of Article 402, the article which criminalized same-sex sexual relations\u2014with a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a\u00a0five\u00a0million central African CFA franc fine\u2014was only inserted into the new Gabonese Penal Code in July 2019. There is no long history here,\u00a0providing a particularly clear example of\u00a0the\u00a0interplay between law, politics\u00a0and other factors\u00a0that\u00a0result\u00a0in the\u00a0arbitrary\u00a0and often cavalier\u00a0granting and withdrawing\u00a0of\u00a0rights protections\u00a0related to sexuality, with very real impacts on people\u2019s lives.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAll of this\u00a0supports\u00a0the idea that\u00a0sexual and reproductive rights\u00a0are\u00a0an important lens for thinking about how human rights\u00a0more generally\u00a0evolve within and beyond institutional spaces (i.e., in linking the civil and political to the economic, social and cultural), as well as the\u00a0ways in which the\u00a0interactions\u00a0 between lived realities and the legal, technical, and political spheres\u00a0allow\u00a0human rights norms and standards\u00a0to\u00a0develop and change.\u00a0This may be\u00a0because sexual and reproductive rights denote very different things\u00a0to different\u00a0actors\u00a0in different\u00a0contexts, showing how\u00a0the nature of the concern with specific topics (ranging from abortion to sex work) continues to influence the extent to which\u00a0even the same\u00a0actor will\u00a0engage in expansive or restrictive approaches.\nWhat brings these pieces together is that all\u00a0show how rights frameworks can help expose, assess and challenge systematically the inequalities connected to sex, to sexuality, to reproduction,\u00a0and ultimately to health and well-being for all people.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nResistance in many cases stems from claims to radically different understandings (and fears) of what\u00a0\u201csexual rights\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201creproductive rights\u201d\u00a0include and, therefore, how\u00a0recognition\u00a0might bind states and other actors.\u00a0\u00a0It is perhaps for this reason, more than any other, that resistance to sexual and reproductive rights comes not only from the \u201cusual suspects\u201d but\u00a0even from\u00a0some traditional human rights scholars.\u00a0What is apparent in current debates is the way in which even those with an ostensibly expansive view in one domain may not have that same expansive perspective when it comes to other issues.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn a particularly telling example,\u00a0illustrated\u00a0in one\u00a0piece in this series,\u00a0Argentina is\u00a0at the forefront of putting into law gender-transition related healthcare for trans people as well as options for legal gender and name\u00a0changes, but induced abortion remains a criminal offense. All of this\u00a0limits meaningful interaction between work to support\u00a0different aspects of\u00a0sexual rights, reproductive rights, and human rights more broadly, and\u00a0stokes the\u00a0lack of trust or engagement\u00a0that still exists among\u00a0different areas of\u00a0movement politics; including\u00a0between\u00a0women\u2019s rights,\u00a0transgender rights,\u00a0disability rights, lesbian and gay rights,\u00a0and reproductive health and rights movements.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nInspired by this collection and the work of these authors, I close\u00a0by\u00a0noting human rights standards provide a touch stone, but their mere articulation, while essential is far from sufficient. Stronger, active and organized resistance to\u00a0state sponsored regression is fundamental, and specifically with respect to gender, race,\u00a0and equality across all identities. What brings these pieces together is that all\u00a0show how rights frameworks can help expose, assess and challenge systematically the inequalities connected to sex, to sexuality, to reproduction,\u00a0and ultimately to health and well-being for all people.\u00a0Leading then\u00a0to the ultimate question:\u00a0in what ways\u00a0can these different approaches to reproductive and\u00a0sexual rights push human rights bodies, scholars,\u00a0and activists\u00a0not only\u00a0to better understand\u00a0but to\u00a0address\u00a0the limits of current discourse and protections\u00a0for all people?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis piece is part of a series published in partnership with Occidental College\u2019s\u202fYoung Initiative on the Global Political Economy, the\u202fdivision of Social Sciences at Arizona State University, and USC\u2019s\u202fInstitute on Inequalities in Global Health.
