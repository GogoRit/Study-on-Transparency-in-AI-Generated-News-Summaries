Arkansas Passes \u201cUnborn Child Protection Act\u201dBrenna Lewis - 10 Mar 2021\u00a0\nOn Tuesday, March 9th, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed the \u201cUnborn Child Protection Act\u201d for which the only exception is life of the mother (click here to read why abortion is never medically necessary).\u00a0Especially in the context of 14 other states that have also proposed some type of abortion ban, this victory is very exciting. This era of discrimination against preborn human beings is slowly but surely coming to an end!\n\nPro-life state legislators, of course, have a vested interest in protecting their preborn citizens from the abortion industry in their state. But the pro-life movement at large is also hopeful that this law may be able to challenge\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0in a significant way. The abortion lobby has, naturally, vowed to do everything they can to erase this law using their favorite method \u2013 overriding the will of voters and using the court system to club Americans over the head with radical abortion policy.\n\u201cWe must abolish abortion in this nation just as we abolished slavery in the 19th century \u2014 all lives matter,\u201d Republican Sen. Jason Rapert, the bill\u2019s sponsor said in a statement.\nSFLA President Kristan Hawkins with Senator Rapert.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Pro-Life Generation thanks Senator Jason Rapert for his leadership and thanks all the legislators who joined in this bi-partisan effort on behalf of the preborn and their mothers,\u201d said SFLA\u2019s Kristan Hawkins.\nStudents for Life Action\u2019s efforts on behalf of the pro-life legislation included generating more than more than 4,700 emails into the capitol and Governor\u2019s mansion. SFLAction called more than 42,000 pro-lifers in Arkansas, urging them to call their state legislators in support of this bill. Additionally, we sent over 130,000 personal text messages to pro-lifers in targeted senate offices. We are the Pro-Life Generation!\u00a0\nHuman life begins at fertilization \u2013 read more here.\nGovernor Hutchinson wishes this bill had rape exceptions \u2013 here\u2019s why we\u2019re glad there aren\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,538\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
