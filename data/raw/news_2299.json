That is, the attached poster has the right to stand and may not be removed.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, members of the Open Discussion Club alleged that several of their posters were torn down by students, faculty members and staff across campus. These posters, hung in Persson Hall, Frank Dining Hall and the O\u2019Connor Campus Center (COOP), represent viewpoints of club individuals who are attempting to foster open political discourse and debate across campus in a civil and communal forum. These posters, paired with the sponsored event featuring author Heather MacDonald, have prompted controversy circulating both university policy in regards to advertising, in addition to student opposition towards the\u00a0club\u2019s viewpoints.\nClub members, including President of the Open Discussion Club sophomore Anthony Palazzola, alleged that there have been several incidences of their posters, specifically their \u201cJoin the Pro-Life Generation!\u201d posters having been torn down by faculty and staff.\n\u201cMost of the posters which express specific opinions are torn down within a day or two of being posted,\u201d Palazzola said.\nIn specific reference to the tearing down of their posters, several members, including sophomore Reed Cleland, emphasized that these types of actions are expected of those who oppose the posters\u2019 messages.\n\u201cWhen you take on the status quo, whichever side of the political spectrum you are from, whether you are from the right or are on the left, whenever you challenge the status quo\u2013\u2013and there is a status quo at Colgate University\u2013\u2013you can expect resistance, that\u2019s just natural and so I think part of the whole with the posters being taken down, that\u2019s just part of the natural order of things and how it goes and you have to expect that,\u201d Cleland said.\nSophomore Kelsey Bonham revealed that she had torn down several of the \u201cJoin the Pro-Life Generation\u201d posters that hung around campus.\n\u201cI took down several of the pro-life posters that they had posted around campus for multiple reasons, partially because they were factually incorrect and spreading misinformation and should not be protected under free speech,\u201d Bonham said.\nIn regard to the posters, Bonham expressed her discontent with the viewpoints shown and sees potential for harm to the student body who have visible access to these posters across campus.\n\u201cThe odds that at least one person on this campus has had an abortion in her lifetime are pretty high and I haven\u2019t, but I am sure that if I had, I am sure I would really not enjoy seeing that poster in a space that is supposed to be safe for me and a space that is supposed to be educational,\u201d Bonham said.\n\u00a0In addition to Bonham, several other students have expressed discontent with the information and statistics featured on the posters, including senior Anne Getz Eidelhoch.\n\u201cI believe that this could be a very interesting and important conversation because of a variety of viewpoints, but how it\u2019s being presented now does not seem like an open discussion, it seems like propaganda being hung around campus,\u201d Getz Eidelhoch said.\nUniversity policy on advertising has several guidelines in place to protect free speech, while also enforcing rules to ensure the safety of all those on campus. Associate Vice President for Campus Safety, Emergency Management and Environmental Health and Safety Dan Gough clarified university policies on advertising and mentioned that these policies transcend across all posters, not just those advertising an event.\n\u201cBut the term \u2018advertising\u2019 means to advertise not just for an event but for opinion, or club, or point of view or whatever the case may be,\u201d Gough said.\nGough mentioned that there have been no reported incidents of the Open Discussion Club\u2019s posters, specifically the Pro-Life posters, being torn down and emphasized the importance of upholding university policies by individuals on campus.\n\u201cI would encourage members of the organization to report that to campus safety. If someone is tearing down posters that do meet the provisions of the advertising policy\u2013\u2013for example it says the organization\u2019s name, that that\u2019s printed on the poster, that they are hung on designated bulletin boards, all of those things that are outlined by the policy \u2013\u2013if someone is taking that down that\u2019s a violation of University policy,\u201d Gough said.\nMember of the Open Discussion Club and senior Connor Madalo further stated that the club is operating within University policy.\n\u201cThis is a private university who has their own policies, we abide by that but as far as we can allow open discussion and new ideas to spread in a manner that\u2019s healthy and positive, we\u2019re all for that,\u201d Madalo said.\nThe club\u2019s attempts for discussion have faced opposition and various responses, including a reaction from sophomore Elizabeth Drebin.\n\u201cAlthough I understand that in this country we have a right to free speech, in my perspective, portraying false narratives regarding pro-life positions is wrong,\u201d Drebin said. \u201cThis organization may be called the \u2018Open Discussion Club,\u2019 but they truly are just portraying a right-wing narrative in which they can hide behind the first amendment in order to spread a false narrative about people who receive abortions and/or people who go to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\nCasey said that false narratives, as Drebin calls them, are difficult to check, and he is unsure if inaccurate free speech falls within a specific governing body.\n\u201cFree speech doesn\u2019t mean free accurate speech\u2026It\u2019s extremely difficult to monitor free inaccurate speech\u2026.I\u2019m not sure there would be a legitimate body whose job is about accuracy of things that are said in classrooms, things that are said on boards,\u201d Casey said.\nPresident of Planned Parenthood at Colgate senior Rachel Burg reinforces the importance of open discussion in the case of conflict.\n\u201cI think sometimes having these polarizing things up allows for these kinds of discussions to happen and for people like me who [are] very involved in Planned Parenthood to be able to talk about these things and say why they are incorrect is sometimes more important than\u00a0silencing these voices,\u201d Burg said.\nMembers of The Open Discussion Club do not plan to directly address the tearing down of their posters, but rather urge individuals to attend their open forum club meetings and get\u00a0involved with the organization.\n\u201cIf you disagree with the opinion, please don\u2019t tear it down, come to our club meetings and we will sponsor your corresponding or opposing opinion to that statement. We want opinions to thrive next to each other and to compete with one another, we don\u2019t want an opinion to go up and then have it torn down,\u201d Palazzola said.\nThe club is looking into pursuing lock boxes or locked frames to hang their posters to avoid further tampering with their publications. Faculty\nadvisor and political science Professor Barry Shain stated his support of these lock boxes to ensure that the organizations thought-provoking messages are reaching its audiences around campus.\nJunior Estelle Kelty proposed that the club should be more forthcoming about the information on their posters.\n\u201c[The club] should at least give a disclaimer that this is not all the information available.\nIf this is an open discussion forum, I feel that having four statistics [hung up], none of which are entirely factual, shouldn\u2019t be allowed [without saying] \u2018you know there\u2019s a large body of literature other than just these four statistics we are giving you\u2019,\u201d\u00a0Kelty said.\nIn partnership with the Center for Western Civilization, the Open Discussion Club plans to bring conservative political commentator and author Heather Mac Donald to campus on Thursday, February 20 at 5:00 p.m. in Love Auditorium, which will include a Q&A following the event.\n\u201cWe want people who disagree with her, who have various other opinions, to challenge her. Obviously we want it to be in a civil environment and a civil fashion but we want, that\u2019s the whole point: diversity of opinions,\u201d Palazzola said.\n\n \n\n\t\t\tComment\t\t\nAbout the Contributor\n\nNicole Dienst, Executive EditorNicole Dienst is a senior from Westport, CT, studying English, economics and environmental studies.
