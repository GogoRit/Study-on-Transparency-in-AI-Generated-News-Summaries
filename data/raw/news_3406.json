(Nadav Soroker, Wyoming Tribune Eagle/Wyoming News Exchange)\n\n\n\n\n \nWe appreciate you being a member of the WyoFile community. Our work is made possible by dedicated members like you who invest in our reporting - thank you!\n\n\nCassandra Scott considers herself a veteran of Wyoming\u2019s often dicey travel conditions.\nYet the treacherous roads still took her by surprise on the clear day in February when she and her husband left their Laramie home and drove to Fort Collins to get an abortion for medical reasons. Both lanes of the highway were slicked with ice, and wind-fueled ground blizzards obscured the pavement. She watched a car slide across the grassy median and into her lane. A drive that should have taken an hour stretched into three.\nBy the time she arrived at the Planned Parenthood, she was an hour late for her appointment \u2014 the office had tried to call Scott, but cell service was spotty on the drive. She begged the receptionist not to reschedule: They\u2019d had to ask her mother to babysit, her husband had the day off and they didn\u2019t want to repeat the drive. Plus, it had taken three weeks to schedule the appointment in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a time-sensitive matter,\u201d Scott said.\nShe was persuasive, which turned out in her favor. After her ultrasound, Scott discovered she wasn\u2019t six weeks pregnant, as she\u2019d originally believed, but 11 weeks and three days. That meant she would need a surgical, rather than a medication abortion. Scott was grateful her husband was there, because the clinic would not have allowed her to drive home alone.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hurdles and obstacles in just that short distance,\u201d Scott said.\nLike Scott, most Wyoming women who seek an abortion must travel to Colorado for the procedure. There are only two Wyoming providers \u2014 both in Jackson \u2014 that perform the procedure. One clinic only provides medication abortions up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and the other offers both surgical and medication abortions.\u00a0\n\u201cWyoming wasn\u2019t on the radar for abortion restrictions for decades.\u201dElizabeth Nash, Guttmacher Institute\nAccording to the 2020 Induced Termination Pregnancy Report, 91 abortions were performed in Wyoming that year, all of which took place before 11 weeks. Many more state residents had the procedure, according to Dr. Giovannina Anthony, who works at one of the last clinics in the state openly providing abortions, just not inside the state limits.\n\u201cSeventy percent of Wyoming women who get an abortion do so in Colorado,\u201d Anthony said. Just the Pill, a website that allows women to order abortion-inducing medications by mail, does serve residents, but for surgical abortions, women mostly travel out of state.\u00a0\nThe already limited access to abortions in Wyoming could soon be completely eliminated.\nIn a reversal of long-standing policy, the Wyoming Legislature passed what could amount to a total abortion ban, except in cases where medically necessary, or when pregnancy is a result of rape or incest \u2013 a carve out that barely passed. House Bill 92 \u2013 Abortion prohibition-supreme court decision would ban abortion in the state should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.\nGov. Mark Gordon signed the \u201ctrigger-ban\u201d bill into law Tuesday.\nAbortion access, like access to many kinds of medical care in Wyoming, has long been limited by availability. But the level of legislative support for anti-abortion legislation necessary to pass HB 92 marks a more recent shift. For years bills banning abortion struggled to gain traction.\n\u201cWyoming wasn\u2019t on the radar for abortion restrictions for decades,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research center. A shift in the Legislature\u2019s makeup, more aggressive anti-abortion lobbying efforts and a more piece-meal approach to restrictions converged to make HB 92 possible, according to both advocates and opponents of the abortion ban.\n\u201cI think that the grassroots like myself are beginning to rise up and say, \u2018We need to get involved,\u2019\u201d said Rep. John Bear (R-Gillette), one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsor\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been being represented by people that don\u2019t necessarily represent our values. And so that\u2019s why I think you see a change.\u201d\nA sign on a house in Lander. Gov. Mark Gordon signed House Bill 92 \u2013 Abortion prohibition-supreme court decision into law on Tuesday. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, most abortions will be banned in Wyoming. (Sofia Jeremias/WyoFile)\nAccess restraints\nWyoming already has some restrictions on the books, including mandatory parental consent for minors and a prohibition of public funds to pay for abortions except in certain scenarios such as rape and incest, or if the procedure is deemed medically necessary, according to NARAL-Pro Choice America.\nSurgical abortions aren\u2019t widely available in Wyoming because there isn\u2019t enough demand to cover the costs of purchasing equipment and training nurses, said Anthony. Dr. Brent Blue is the only physician in the state to offer surgical abortions, although he says it\u2019s a rarely requested procedure.\nEven without laws that restrict access to abortion, there are not many options for women seeking to terminate a pregnancy. Those who travel to Salt Lake City or Boise for abortions must contend with waiting-period laws that can extend time away. Utah requires a 72-hour waiting period between consultation and procedure, while Idaho requires 24 hours.\nWyoming\u2019s brutal winter conditions and frequent road closures pose another hurdle, said Christine Lichtenfels, a board member of Chelsea\u2019s Fund, an organization that provides financial assistance to those seeking an abortion. \u201cThat\u2019s a real problem,\u201d Lichtenfels said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to get time off of work, get childcare, maybe borrow a car.\u201d\nIdaho\u2019s Legislature banned abortions after six weeks, and Utah has a trigger-ban bill in place, that, like Wyoming\u2019s, would ban the procedure if Roe were overturned.\nRestrictions across several states means those seeking abortions may have to travel as far away as Oregon or California, where resources could be quickly overwhelmed, Nash at Guttmacher said.\n\u201cThere will be a period of time where capacity is stretched very thinly, because even in states with availability like Oregon, California, Washington or Colorado, they also aren\u2019t able to meet the need that exists in their state,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you add in more patients, particularly patients who are traveling, that\u2019s a big burden.\u201d\nA recent shift\nBetween the late 1980s and 2017 abortion bans were essentially off of Wyoming\u2019s legislative agenda, Nash said. Bills were introduced during that period and some gained a little support, but none made it to the governor\u2019s desk, according to Nash.\nFor example, a 2013 no abortion after heartbeat bill died in committee, while in 2021 the human heartbeat protection act made it out of committee but ultimately died.\nWhile Wyoming has long been a Republican stronghold, legislators were not seeking abortion restrictions as aggressively as they have in the last few years, Nash said. \u201cThere was very much this approach of \u2018there are some things that are private, and you handle them in the way that you believe is best.\u2019\u201d\nIn the last five or so years, though, the Legislature has passed more restrictions and regulations. For example, although Wyoming required clinics to provide data on the number of abortions performed, in 2019 penalties for non-compliance were added.\n\u201cIn the 17 years I\u2019ve been here, I think this Legislature has gone from a much more libertarian conservatism to a full on radical, right-wing-agenda type of political milieu,\u201d Anthony said.\nFour unidentified women took part in a \u201cHandmaid\u2019s protest\u201d outside of the Wyoming Capitol on March 1, 2022 to express their opposition to bills they believe impose restrictions on women. (Rhianna Gelhart/ Wyoming Tribune Eagle/Wyoming News Exchange)\nRobert Johnston, executive director of the Wyoming Health Council, also noted a change. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten much uglier,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cI think that some of the elements that we\u2019re seeing in our Legislature are asking for government oversight of things that a traditional Republican would never have endorsed.\u201d\nSharon Breitweiser, executive director of Pro-Choice Wyoming, wants to dispel the notion that abortion rights were ever completely secure in Wyoming. \u201cWe worked our butts off every year from 1990 through 2022,\u201d Breitweiser said, \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously gotten worse in the last few years.\u201d Breitweiser also noted anti-abortion activists have put more pressure on legislators, using what she described as \u201cbullying tactics.\u201d\nAnti-abortion advocates say they have ramped up efforts in recent years, and that both sides of the issue are racheting up their amplification.\n\u201cWhen I moved here 30 years ago, I just assumed this was a pro-life state until I realized there were abortion laws on the books,\u201d said Marti Halverson, president of the Wyoming chapter of Right to Life. She said in the last few years her organization has been getting more active statewide, and calling out legislators \u201cthat voted against life.\u201d For example, Right to Life ranks legislators on its webpage. Lawmakers who have co-sponosered at least one anti-abortion bill are classified \u201cbronze,\u201d while those who have only supported measures receive an \u201chonorable mention.\u201d\n\u201cI think both sides are getting louder,\u201d Halverson said.\nShe also noted the new class of legislators who were elected in 2020. \u201cI think they drove a lot of the pro-life conversation to the surface,\u201d Halverson said.\nHouse Bill 92\u2019s main sponsor, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams (R-Cody), has served since 2021. Rep. John Romero-Martinez (R-Cheyenne), one of the bill\u2019s 15 co-sponsors, is also a relative new-comer to the Wyoming Legislature, as is Bear.\n\nRep. John Romero-Martinez (R-Cheyenne). (Wyoming Legislature)\n2021 marked what many say is the biggest groundswell of legislative action yet \u2014 lawmakers filed eight abortion bills during the session. \u201cI would say I think it happened last year,\u201d Romero-Martinez said. \u201cI think the groundwork part of the movement has been happening since I was teenager.\u201d\nNone of the three are confident that Roe v. Wade will be overturned. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful,\u201d Halverson said. Romero-Martinez says he did not support the exception allowing victims of rape and incest to access abortions, and if the Supreme Court does allow Wyoming to ban abortion the Legislature will still have work to do.\nFuture access\nWhile women like Scott already travel out of state for abortions, a full ban in Wyoming, Utah and Idaho could result in even longer waiting times and other challenges in places that still offer the procedure.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll once again leave access largely to those that have more resources,\u201d said Lichtenfels with Chelsea\u2019s Fund. \u201cIt\u2019ll be important to get the word out that abortion is still legal in this nation and that people should not feel like they are beaten into submission and can\u2019t have any authority over their own life.\u201d\n \n\n\nBECOME A WYOFILE MEMBER!\nStories like this are free to read, but not free to produce.

In the 1980\u2019s he was supporting LGBTQ rights (even before many Democrats were) and stated that a woman had a right to an abortion. \nThe fact is Barry Goldwater couldn\u2019t be nominated as the GOP candidate for president today.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nHarvey Reading says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 18, 2022 at 5:21 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFull-blown fascism is nearly here\u2026  Saddest thing is, most in Wyoming will welcome it with open arms.

If they were truly pro-life and pro-family, Wyoming would not be the state with the 7th highest infant mortality rate, with 28% of school kids qualifying for free lunch, 11th highest state for teen births, the 6th highest state for low birth weight infants, or the state with the highest incarceration rate for juveniles.

Pregnancy and childbirth completely change a woman\u2019s life. Women give everything for their children \u2013 their physical health, their economic well-being, all of their time every day. \nGiving human rights to a fetus inevitably strips away the rights of the woman on whose body the fetus depends. And what is the result for women and their children? The result is widespread poverty, domestic abuse, sexual assault. Women and children suffer when the system of government denies women authority over their own bodies and treats women as objects rather than human beings. \nMotherhood should not be a hardship and dependent on charity. Children should grow up in an environment that nourishes them and provides opportunity for a solid foundation on which to build a life.  \nSupport individual reproductive freedom. Give everyone the chance to take joy from the birth of a child.

ALEC is the American Legislative Exchange Council which is  98% funded by corporations and right wing think tanks ( with very little revenue from membership dues although it claims otherwise ) . ALEC exists to provide boilerplate \u2018 fill in the blanks\u2019 draft legislation to state legislators nationwide. Think of it as Templates for Tyranny. ALEC has a lot of clout and/or tacit  support among Wyoming legislators.  ALEC\u2019s boilerplate covers a lot of diverse policy ground dear to the heart of right wing activists, things like anti-gun control , promoting for profit  lprisons, and censoring certin hot button education curriculae . Sound familiar ? FRC is the FamilyResearch Center , an extremist Christian policy engine that does what ALEC does , only more narrowly. Think of all those \u201d Anti-abortion heartbeat bills \u201d that are popping up in red states. Most all the strident anti-LGBTQ legislation  is gestated by the  FRC.  Wyoming legislators draw deeply from the well of both these activist   far right wing policy wholesalers.\nTrust me on this. Few if any elected Wyoming lawmakers have the intellectual prowess to draft any of these dangerously subversive bills on their own. But try to get any of them to admit to sourcing. I\u2019ve tried.  \u201d Where did you get the language for  HB-92 ,  Rachel ? \u201d   or \u201d Who provided you the text of HB0097 Chuck Gray ? \u201d   All those sorts of  queries go abjectly unanswered.\nDo you really think the deep red conservative Wyoming legislator represents you ? If the topic is abortion , education , guns , more guns, still more guns, or anything with the word \u2018 gender\u2019 in it, that legislator is answering to ALEC and FRC and WGO way before they ever get around to addressing your hometown or rural county concerns.\nReport on THAT , please\u2026\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nNancy Morgan says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 17, 2022 at 7:58 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFinally\u2026action to stop the baby killing.

The \u201cNo-On-One\u201d campaign I was involved with in the 90\u2019s resulted in a landslide ballot defeat of the attempt to ban abortions in Wyoming. Even while some may not support abortions, they don\u2019t think they should be able to tell someone else what to do with their bodies. I recall a letter to an editor from someone who said, \u201cleave our guns and bodies alone\u201d in true libertarian speak.\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\nAnn Strand-Budd says: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 17, 2022 at 6:46 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t It strange that these male Republicans are determined to take away a woman\u2019s decision that should be made by a woman, her doctor and her God?
