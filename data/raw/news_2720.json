Since then, she has publicly questioned the tradeoff that those who oppose\u00a0abortions have made in endorsing Trump.Krider is still passionate about reducing abortions in Ohio and across the country.She advocated for legislation that would ban abortions after a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome or after 20 weeks of gestation. Ohio Right to Life recently pushed for a ban on abortions after as early as six weeks gestation, known as the \"heartbeat bill.\"\u00a0But Krider said that shouldn't be the only goal of anti-abortion evangelicals.\u00a0Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\"I am confident that, in advocating for this president, we will have lost our soul,\" Krider wrote in a letter to the Washington Post. \"The church is meant to be known for our unconditional love of others. By supporting Trump, we show only our love of power.\"[ Support local journalism: Subscribe. ]Krider was particularly demoralized by\u00a0silence from her peers about Trump's response to the novel coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests after the killing\u00a0of George Floyd, according to her Washington Post letter.\"The organization I worked for remained silent about the pandemic and racism,\" Krider wrote. \"As protests began in the streets below, we were in our office, promoting a\u00a0tele-town hall\u00a0hosted by Pro-Life Voices for Trump, touting his pro-life accomplishments and preparing to\u00a0endorse\u00a0pro-life candidates (including some who, like the president, diminished or outspokenly opposed the Black Lives Matter cause).\"Ohio Right to Life's political action committee endorsed Trump for president. Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life, was a Trump delegate for the 2020 Republican National Convention.Krider told The Enquirer that she no longer supports Trump\u00a0but hasn't yet decided whom she'll select for president.Gonidakis declined to comment about Krider's departure, saying he wished her all the best in her future endeavors.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Cincinnati Enquirer Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Sports Betting Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.cincinnati.com.
