Rick Bowmer/AP\nFight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.On this day in 1973, the Supreme Court issued a decision that enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion in the landmark case Roe v. Wade.\u00a0But with mounting attacks on abortion rights and the most conservative Supreme Court in modern history, states across the country have spent the 47th year of\u00a0Roe\u00a0scrambling to protect a women\u2019s right to choose in the increasingly plausible event that the historic court decision\u00a0is soon overturned.\n\u201cThe reality is that the balance of the Supreme Court is not in our favor,\u201d says Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, who works on state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood, adding, \u201cWe have to be prepared [if] Roe\u00a0falls. That\u2019s just part of the reality of living under the Trump administration.\u201d\u00a0\nThe effort began exactly one year ago, when New York became the first state to enshrine the right to an abortion in its state law, effectively codifying\u00a0Roe v. Wade. (The law also ended New York\u2019s ban on abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.) Since then, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Vermont have all passed similar laws protecting the right to an abortion. Michigan, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia are also looking at codifying the right to an abortion. In 2019, statehouses passed more legislation protecting or expanding abortion access than in the entire previous decade.\u00a0\nHowever, in the aftermath of the confirmation of two staunchly conservative justices to the Supreme Court in 2018, red states have been doing the opposite kind of preparation for a post-Roe world. In 2019,\u00a0four states\u2014Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee\u2014passed legislation known as trigger laws, which would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturned Roe, and 12 states passed\u00a0abortion bans. In total, eight states\u00a0now have trigger laws on the books, and 20 have\u00a0laws that could be used to restrict the right to an abortion if\u00a0Roe were overturned.\n\u201cStates are going in widely divergent directions when it comes to both abortion rights and abortion access,\u201d says Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health. \u201cWe have a group of states last year that were tripping over each other in a race to the bottom to try to ban abortion outright, and then we also had a real record year on the other side.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, roughly 25 million women of reproductive age live in a state where abortion could be banned if\u00a0Roe\u00a0is overturned. Millions more are already forced to jump through hoops to access abortions, including 72-hour waiting periods, mandatory counseling, and invasive ultrasound procedures.\nIn March, the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since the confirmation of conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law, which requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, a\u00a0stipulation that opponents of the bill argue would leave the state with only one provider for a population of more than 4.5 million. Although the justices are not expected to overturn Roe outright in this case, legal experts argue that if the court were to rule in favor of the law, access to abortion in states like Louisiana could exist in name only.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for news you can trust?\n\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n\nAN IMPORTANT UPDATEWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming up short on donations month after month.
