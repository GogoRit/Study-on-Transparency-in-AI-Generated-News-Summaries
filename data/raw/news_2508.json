Hell, I hope I see these same folks next weekend \u2014 we\u2019ve got a \u2018pro-life\u2019 march on Saturday, and then an NRA picnic on Sunday.\u201d\nThe \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d rally was held in response to a much larger \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d event occurring simultaneously on the other side of town.\n\u201cI believe that all lives matter \u2014 which means it really fucking pisses me off when people say that black lives matter,\u201d explained rally attendee Waylon Jarrett. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s great to see everyone back after last year\u2019s candlelight vigil to reinstate death-by-firing-squads. It\u2019s a gorgeous day, and we\u2019ve got tons of people out here supporting America because they want what\u2019s best for our country. Although we did have to kick out a few pussies for wearing masks.\u201d\nAccording to experts, support of the death penalty is common amongst the \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d movement.\n\u201cIn psychology, we call it \u2018cognitive dissonance\u2019 \u2014 when a person holds seemingly incompatible beliefs, such as saying that \u2018all lives matter,\u2019 while also endorsing state-sanctioned execution,\u201d noted renowned psychologist Dr. Anna St. Claire. \u201cOr pro-life advocates who have no issue with cops needlessly murdering civilians, or Trump voters who claim they aren\u2019t \u2018racist scum.\u2019 You get the idea.\u201d\nAt press time, several \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d protestors gathered to protect a confederate statue, which they later discovered was actually a local KFC\u2019s \u201cColonel Sanders\u201d promotional display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard Shoppes\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Punk News Comin' Your Way!!!  \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to optimize our website and our service.\n\n\n\n\nFunctional cookies\n\n\n\nFunctional cookies\n\nAlways active \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical storage or access is strictly necessary for the legitimate purpose of enabling the use of a specific service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user, or for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferences\n\n\nPreferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical storage or access is necessary for the legitimate purpose of storing preferences that are not requested by the subscriber or user.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technical storage or access that is used exclusively for statistical purposes.\nThe technical storage or access that is used exclusively for anonymous statistical purposes.
