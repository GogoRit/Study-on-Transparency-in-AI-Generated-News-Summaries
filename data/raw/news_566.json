That means abortions will only be permitted in cases of rape, incest and when a mother's life is endangered. The Constitutional Tribunal\u00a0ruled\u00a0on October 22 that abortions for reasons of fetal abnormality violate the Polish constitution.\nThat decision sparked weeks of mass demonstrations \u2014 prompting the government to refuse to publish the tribunal's verdict \u2014 a legally mandated step that makes the ruling binding. The protests have grown smaller in recent weeks, lessening the political danger for the nationalist government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe verdict soured already difficult relations between Warsaw and Brussels, where the Polish government is under fire for allegedly backsliding on democracy. The European Parliament adopted a resolution that \"strongly condemns\"\u00a0the tightening of abortion rules \u2014 already among the strictest in the EU.\nPiS has formed a political alliance with parts of the powerful Roman Catholic Church, which strongly opposes allowing any abortions. \nThe decision to publish the verdict prompted warnings of more demonstrations from the All-Poland Women's Strike, which organized the earlier protests and demands the government resign.\n\"Tonight could be heavy,\" the group said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Tags\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolish Politics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPublic health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWomen's Health\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Countries\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoland\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Organizations\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEuropean Parliament\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOur readers read next\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForeign ministers back new Russia sanctions following Navalny\u2019s death\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t21 HRS ago \t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s TV show broke UK broadcasting rules\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome advice for Russia\u2019s newest opposition leader\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n8 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT FROM ASTRAZENECA\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUrgent call to policymakers \u2013 make chronic kidney disease a public health priority\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 18\t\t\n\n7 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMore from William Adkins\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOut of office: The politicians and advisers who have left their posts due to coronavirus\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe pandemic has not been good for political job security.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 15\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMacron and Merkel discuss vaccine cooperation with Russia\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe European Medicines Agency is conducting a rolling review of Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 31\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUK to prioritize own vaccine rollout before sharing shots with others\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\u2018Our focus has to be to try and keep Britain safe,\u2019 says senior Cabinet member.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 30\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChina sanctions British MPs in retaliatory move\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAnnouncement comes after UK joined EU in sanctioning Chinese officials over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. \n\n\n\n\t\t\tMar 26\t\t\n\n2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nApp Store\n\n\nPlay Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\nAgriculture and Food\n\n\nCentral Banker\n\n\nCompetition and Industrial Policy\n\n\nCybersecurity and Data Protection\n\n\nDefense\n\n\nEnergy and Climate\n\n\nEnergy and Climate UK\n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\nFinancial Services UK\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\nMobility\n\n\nParis Influence\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nTechnology UK\n\n\nTrade\n\n\nTrade UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nBerlin Bulletin\n\n\nBerlin Playbook\n\n\nBrussels Playbook\n\n\nChina Watcher\n\n\nDigital Bridge\n\n\nDimanchissime\n\n\nEU Election Playbook\n\n\nEU Influence\n\n\nGlobal Playbook\n\n\nGlobal Policy Lab: Living Cities\n\n\nLondon Influence\n\n\nLondon Playbook\n\n\nPlaybook Paris\n\n\nPOLITICO Confidential\n\n\nSunday Crunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\nEU Confidential\n\n\nPolitics at Jack and Sam's\n\n\nPower Play\n\n\nWestminster Insider\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nAll Opinion\n\n\nBeyond the Bubble\n\n\nClub Med\n\n\nDeclassified\n\n\nFrom Across the Pond\n\n\nUnpacked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Series\n\n\nCOP28\n\n\nLiving Cities\n\n\nPOLITICO 28\n\n\nQatargate files\n\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\n\nPOLITICO Pro\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\nResearch and analysis division\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n\nMedia Solutions\n\n\nResearch and Analysis Division\n\n\nPress\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nCareers at POLITICO\n\n\nTs&Cs\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nManage Privacy Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
