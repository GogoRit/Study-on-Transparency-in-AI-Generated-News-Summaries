They\u2019re trying to recruit at different protests, even at college campuses.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re active, they\u2019re emboldened,\u201d Goldenberg added.\nMarch for Life Chicago disavowed the group on Twitter, ahead of Saturday\u2019s rally, writing \u201cThe March for Life Chicago is in no way affiliated with the Patriot Front and opposes white supremacy.\u201d\nPatriot Front hasn\u2019t written about joining the march on its website or on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where the group typically touts its public demonstrations.\nPatriot Front didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions from the Sun-Times.\nAs the anti-abortion activists concluded their rally Saturday, Patriot Front continued to march through Grant Park and crossed the tunnel to the other side of the street, where they were picked up by a fleet of cars with covered license plates.\nPatriot Front held their own little-publicized rally in the Loop nearly a year ago, which also coincided with a March for Life Chicago demonstration.\nSince 2017, members of the group have attended three pro-life rallies in Chicago and demonstrated in the city a total of ten times, according to the\u00a0Anti-Defamation League.\nIn 2018, members of the group were thrown out of a pro-life rally in the city after displaying a banner that read \u201cPROTECT OUR POSTERITY\u201d and referenced the phrase \u201cblood and soil,\u201d according to a blog post on the Pro-Life Action League\u2019s website. \u201cBlood and soil\u201d is a Nazi slogan that was chanted by demonstrators in Charlottesville.\n\u201cWe applaud those people who rejected them,\u201d Goldenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for communities to reject this type of hate and to do it vocally.\u201d\n\nCopyright CHIST - SunTimes\n\n\nThis article tagged under:\nLoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTrending Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnews\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t31-year-old earns $220,000 a year and saves 75% of his salary by living with his parents: \u2018I'm grateful for this choice'\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllinois Election 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere to vote in Illinois: Here's how to find your polling place\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllinois Election 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllinois primary 2024: What time do polls open and close on election day?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArlington Heights\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArlington Heights reveals new tax bill option for Bears' stadium after team shifts focus to Chicago\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllinois Election 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast-minute 2024 Illinois primary election guide: What's on your ballot and more\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWeather Forecast\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NBC Chicago\nTelemundo Chicago\nOur News Standards\nSubmit Tips for Investigations\nNewsletters\nConnect With Us\nNBC Sports Chicago\nWMAQ Public Inspection File\nWMAQ Accessibility\nWMAQ Employment Information\nSend Feedback\nFCC Applications\nTerms of Service\nYour Privacy Choices\nPrivacy Policy\nAdvertise with us\nCA Notice\nAd Choices\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.
