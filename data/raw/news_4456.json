It called on armed groups to take special measures to protect women and girls from rape and sexual abuse, and urged governments to prosecute those who committed these crimes.It also called for more funding for local women\u2019s groups, and for greater protection for women and girls in refugee settings.The past 20 years has seen slow progress. More women now sit at the negotiating table, but gender parity is a distant dream.\u00a0Between 1992 and 2019, women constituted, on average, 13% of negotiators, 6% of mediators and 6% of signatories to major peace agreements.\u00a0Women constitute\u00a0fewer than 5% of the 95,000 active UN peacekeepers and about 11% of police in UN missions.Sexual violence is rife in conflict, but prosecutions are rare. The UN is concerned that Covid-19 will increase the risk of sexual exploitation, abuse, child marriage, and trafficking among displaced women and girls.Since 2000, the security council has adopted a further nine resolutions on women, peace and security. Another is expected this year.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since then the security council has adopted nine further resolutions on women and security \u2013 at least five have a specific focus on the use of rape as a weapon of war.But there are huge gaps in implementation. Between 1992 and 2019, women have made up an average of 13% of negotiators, 6% of mediators and 6% of signatories in major peace processes.The recent rollback on women\u2019s rights globally has made further progress difficult.Last year a resolution introduced by Germany to combat wartime rape was only passed when references in the text to sexual and reproductive health and rights were removed to suit the US.Vanessa Jackson, UN representative for the NGO Care International, said: \u201cWe very much feel that when you reach the 20th year of bedding down a whole framework and 10 security council resolutions to try to advance women\u2019s right to be involved in peace and security, you can begin to look at what are the gaps and how do we address them \u2013 and there are many gaps in implementation.\u201cBut what we have been seeing in the past couple of years is the women, peace and security agenda has become another battleground for women\u2019s human rights. The pushback we\u2019re seeing globally is happening in the council.\u201dHannah Bond, director of Gender Action for Peace and Security, added: \u201c2020 marks an important milestone for women, peace and security. It should have focused on implementation of the many commitments not yet met by the international community, including the urgent need for more funding to support women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights in conflict.\u201d'Be afraid': one woman\u2019s fight to hold Liberia\u2019s warlords to accountRead moreVoting is expected to play out along geopolitical lines, with China backing Russia, which currently holds the presidency of the security council. It is unclear how the UK and other western states, including France and the US, will vote.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said: \u201cWe will not accept any backsliding on this vital agenda and are working with our partners to ensure the resolution upholds the progress made on women\u2019s rights over the last 20 years.\u201dAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, British minister James Cleverly is expected to announce funding to support female mediators.The Russian mission to the UN did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsPeace and reconciliationWomen's rights and gender equalityUnited NationsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
