Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a near-total ban on abortion into law.\n\nSAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill into law that makes performing an abortion illegal in the state, with an exception only in the case of a medical emergency.\n    \n\n            \u201cAs governor, I represent all 4 million Oklahomans and they overwhelmingly support protecting life in the state of Oklahoma. We want Oklahoma to be the most pro-life state in the country. We want to outlaw abortion in the state of Oklahoma,\u201d the governor said.\n    \n\nSenate Bill 612, which cleared the state Senate last year and the House earlier this month, makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The law does not provide exceptions in cases of rape and incest.\n    \n\n            Under the measure, the woman would not be criminally charged or convicted for the death of her \u201cunborn child.\u201d The legislation does not prohibit the use, sale, prescription or administration of contraceptives.\n    \n\n            The governor was joined at the signing by members of the Oklahoma legislature, faith leaders from across the state, as well as representatives from anti-abortion advocacy groups.\n    \n\n            \u201cI know this bill will be challenged immediately by liberal activists from the coast, who always seem to want to come in and dictate, and mandate, and challenge our way of life here in the state of Oklahoma. The most important thing is to take a stand and protect the unborn and protect life in the state of Oklahoma,\u201d Stitt added.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 200 abortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the Old Courthouse in St. Louis, for a rally on Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021. Speakers warned that Missouri will likely pursue a restrictive abortion law similar to Texas. \n\nJim Salter/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nAbortion access under renewed threat in Oklahoma and Missouri \n\n\n\n\n            Oklahoma Republican state Rep. Jim Olsen, SB 612\u2019s principal House author, previously told CNN that he believes \u201crape and incest is a horrible crime\u201d and though the baby is conceived in a \u201chorrible situation\u201d that it \u201cstill has a right to life.\u201d \u201cThe baby should not be liable for the sins of the father,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a life.\u201d\n    \n\n            White House press secretary Jen Psaki condemned the law, calling it \u201cone of the most extreme state laws signed into law to date.\u201d In her statement Tuesday, Psaki also urged Congress to pass the Woman\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe v. Wade, after the legislation failed to overcome Senate hurdles in February, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining Republicans to block its passage.\n    \n\n            \u201cMake no mistake: the actions today in Oklahoma are a part of disturbing national trend attacking women\u2019s rights and the Biden Administration will continue to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            Stitt\u2019s signature on the legislation made Oklahoma the latest Republican-led state to approve new restrictions on abortion access in recent weeks. Last month, Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law a ban on most abortions in the state after 15 weeks, similar to a Mississippi law that\u2019s before the US Supreme Court, and South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem has signed legislation that further restricts access to medication abortions in the state.\n    \n\n            In Idaho, the state Supreme Court temporarily blocked legislation recently signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little that was modeled after Texas\u2019 law that bans abortions after about six weeks. Idaho had become the first state to follow the controversial Texas statute that allows private citizens to enforce the restrictions with lawsuits. \n    \n\n            The bill had been decried by abortion rights proponents throughout the legislative process, including the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which said last week that the law \u201cwould be devastating\u201d for Oklahomans and also Texans, who make up nearly half of the patients who seek abortion care in Oklahoma.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe will fight back against these cruel bans in court because people shouldn\u2019t have to cross state lines in secret to access care that should be available in their communities,\u201d Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, said in a statement released following the signing. \n    \n\n            The Oklahoma state Senate is also considering legislation, House Bill 4327, modeled after the controversial Texas law. That bill would \u200bban most abortions at any point in pregnancy and allow private citizens to enforce the law through civil litigation.\n    \n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n\n\n  CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
