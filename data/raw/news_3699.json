Jackson, which overturned Roe v. Wade, represents the most significant change in abortion law in nearly 50 years. As a result, state governments have been acting fast to either implement anti-abortion legislation or reassert their commitment to abortion rights. Meanwhile, many medical institutions, social workers, and healthcare providers are scrambling to understand the new rules for serving their communities while staying on the right side of the law.\nIn the wake of the Court\u2019s immensely consequential ruling, Christians are asking many questions. What does pro-life ministry look like in a post-Roe world? How can the church articulate a compassionate vision for supporting women in crisis-pregnancy situations? How do pastors lead in this moment?\nThese and other questions are covered in this candid webinar. Cohosted by CT and the National Association of Evangelicals, this virtual roundtable features a diverse panel of Christian leaders from advocacy, pastoral, and theological backgrounds.\n\u201cWe have the ability as the body of Christ to respond to this, but we\u2019ve got to be thinking about it through the lens of meeting the physical, emotional, spiritual, and social needs of people,\u201d says Care Net president Roland Warren, who along with the other panelists stressed the need for a greater commitment to discipleship and to coming alongside people who are struggling with difficult pregnancy decisions. \u201cThese life decisions need the life support that the body of Christ is uniquely positioned to provide.\u201d\nWatch the video above now, and stay connected to CT for more news and features on this issue.\nMeet the Panelists\nKELLY ROSATI\n\n\n\nKelly M.
