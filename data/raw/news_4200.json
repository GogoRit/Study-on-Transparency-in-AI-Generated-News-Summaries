An imposing middle-aged black man who grew up poor in Alabama, he was the movement\u2019s rock star. That all changed overnight, when Candice Russell, a 35-year-old Latina volunteer in Dallas, posted an article on Medium, \u201cTo All the Women Whose Names I Don\u2019t Know, About the Pain We Share, the Secrets We Keep, and the Silence That Shouldn\u2019t Have Been Asked For.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nAlthough her account was somewhat hard to follow, she basically accused him of rape\u2014having sex with her when she was far too drunk to consent\u2014about two years earlier. Parker\u2019s response denying that their sex was nonconsensual went up on Medium the next day, but its unapologetic tone only made matters worse. Within 48 hours, he resigned under pressure from his board positions with the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and Physicians for Reproductive Health and then from Lady Parts Justice League (now the Abortion Action Front). Before long, he had lost or backed out of his upcoming engagements, even in Brazil.\nI didn\u2019t understand at the time why there was such eagerness to cancel him, and I still don\u2019t. Why didn\u2019t movement leaders follow longtime black feminists Loretta Ross and Toni Bond and resist the rush to judgment? Why not say, \u201cThese are serious allegations, and we\u2019re going to look into them\u201d? After all, Russell did not just claim Parker had assaulted her; she claimed that he\u2019d done the same to many others, \u201cwhispers\u201d abounded about his inappropriate behavior, higher-ups in the movement knew all about it, and they had hushed it up.\nExcept for the night in question, which only the two people involved experienced, her claims are likely checkable. I spent a week last spring trying to track down those whispers and came up with very little: \u201cHe bought young women drinks they hadn\u2019t asked for.\u201d One woman told me Parker made an off-color remark to her but didn\u2019t remember what it was, and the person who was with her (I checked) had no memory of anything unusual. Others said they had been warned to be wary of him. Still, by themselves, the rumors don\u2019t add up to much.\nMore interesting than the rumors themselves was people\u2019s reluctance to share them with me. I had \u201cclapped\u201d on Parker\u2019s Medium piece, so perhaps I was perceived as his ally. One person said I was not seen as a friend of the reproductive justice movement. Two others suggested I was the wrong person to write the story because I wasn\u2019t an investigative reporter. Not very flattering, but in the end I thought they might be right. If I were a real reporter, I would have been able to get Russell\u2019s supporters to talk to me.\n\n\n\nPopular\n\"swipe left below to view more authors\"Swipe \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\nMaking Sense of the Fascism Debate\n\n\n\nDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wild History of \u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Voting\n\nThe Wild History of \u201cLesser of Two Evils\u201d Voting\n\n\n\nGinny Hogan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Can\u2019t the Political Press Just Say the Truth About Trump?

The rumors almost always concerned someone else, who couldn\u2019t be contacted or named. The incidents Russell regarded as proof positive of Parker\u2019s being a serial predator didn\u2019t happen quite that way, according to others who were there. Other than Russell, no women told Bullock they were raped, molested, assaulted, touched, or even propositioned. In August one person came forward to claim Parker sexually harassed her: Yamani Hernandez, the head of the National Network of Abortion Funds, said he made salacious remarks to her, including that \u201che would tell his boys back home I was one of his new honeys.\u201d (He denies having said that, and claims the other remarks have been taken out of context.) Playful teasing? Too familiar? Sexist disrespect? For Hernandez, they definitely crossed a line into inappropriate communications to a movement colleague who barely knew him. Still, given that the man lost his reputation, his board positions, and the speaking engagements he told me made up the majority of his income, you would just expect there to be more there there.\nBut then, not everyone agrees that Parker has suffered. The author and activist Robin Marty wrote on a listserv, \u201cHe never lost his career, instead he was removed from being invited to events, his role in boards, his speaking engagements, etc.\u201d Oh. \u201cNobody has a right to be a celebrity,\u201d the activist Mallory McMaster wrote me. \u201cIf someone has shown they\u2019re willing to use their celebrity status or their power in a harmful way\u2026people aren\u2019t obligated to keep lifting that person up.\u201d True enough, but what does fame have to do with Parker being disinvited from doing grand rounds at the New York University School of Medicine? \nCurrent Issue\n\n\n\n \nView our current issue\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original charge of rape has now become something more nebulous: According to several women I spoke with, the problem was bigger than a lack of consent\u2014a word that didn\u2019t come up; the issue was a general power imbalance and Parker\u2019s refusal to acknowledge it. He, a famous doctor and author 20 years her senior, had more power than Russell, a novice activist and freelance writer, and so it was incumbent upon him to acknowledge fault and step away. Reproductive justice, I was told, means centering the less powerful person. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be working from a framework of the impact on abusers or people who have been accused of abuse,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cWe should be working on creating safety.\u201d\nMany people reminded me of the disbelief and shaming that women who come forward have typically been subjected to. Of course, they\u2019re right. Taking women\u2019s claims seriously is what Me Too is all about. But it isn\u2019t dismissing a woman\u2019s claims to investigate them fully. Isn\u2019t Parker owed something from the movement he has devoted himself to for decades? Even as I wrote that question, I wondered if I am guilty of \u201chimpathy\u201d\u2014taking the man\u2019s side because he is, after all, the man. I can\u2019t say for sure that I\u2019m not doing that, but as readers of this column know all too well, it would certainly be a first for me. What I mostly feel is that it\u2019s wrong to treat someone as guilty without looking into the accusation. I\u2019ve spoken to many people who have known Parker and worked with him for decades. They think what happened is a travesty.\nMen accused in Me Too cases often argue that they were denied due process, and sometimes it can sound like a dodge or an excuse or an attempt to impose an impossible burden of proof. I get that. And yet Willie Parker was ousted and ostracized and humiliated on the basis of an accusation posted on a website and rumors of rumors so vague, it isn\u2019t even clear if they are different claims or versions of the same ones. Meanwhile, the potentially verifiable claim of a cover-up by pro-choice leaders has disappeared.\nI asked Parker what due process would mean in his case. He replied, \u201cIt would mean that if someone makes a charge, there would have to be some effort to figure out if the accusation is true.\u201d\nIs that too much to ask?\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article reported off-the-record information. It has since been updated.\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article has been updated to include a comment from Dr. Willie Parker about the remarks referenced by Yamani Hernandez and to more fully reflect her views.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSubmit a correction\n\n\n\n\nSend a letter to the editor\n\n\n\n\nReprints & permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Nation!\nWe hope you enjoyed the story you just read.
