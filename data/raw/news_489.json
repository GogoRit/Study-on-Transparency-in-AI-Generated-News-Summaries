(Butch Dill, AP Photo)(Butch Dill, AP Photo)By Laura Hancock, cleveland.comCOLUMBUS, Ohio - Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Alison Hatheway granted a two-week temporary restraining order late Tuesday afternoon that blocks the enforcement of the state\u2019s new telemedicine abortion ban.Ohio Senate Bill 260, passed by the Ohio General Assembly late last year, was to go into effect on Monday. Next is a hearing before Hatheway on April 19, when she will consider whether to permanently block the law.Last week, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and two of its Ohio affiliates sued the Ohio Department of Health and prosecutors in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties to stop enforcement of SB 260.Planned Parenthood offers medication abortions through telemedicine, which it says is helpful for women who live outside of metro areas and have to arrange for time off of work and child care to otherwise travel for an abortion.Women have their initial visit with a physician at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Cleveland, Columbus or Cincinnati. At the initial visit, they have an exam, ultrasound and counseling as ordered by state law.If a woman chooses to proceed with a medication abortion, she must wait 24 hours under Ohio law. Her second visit can be closer to home via telemedicine at a local clinic, where there is a video consultation with the physician from the initial visit. Then she can receive the medication for the abortion.Ohio Right to Life supported SB 260, arguing it was necessary to ensure the safety of women and the fetus. Mike Gonidakis, its president, said Hatheway\u2019s decision could put them at risk.\u201cNo woman deserves to be subjected to the gruesome process of a chemical abortion potentially hours away from the physician who prescribed her the drugs,\u201d he said in a statement.Iris Harvey, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, said that access to medical abortions through telehealth is a safe and a quick means for pregnant to receive care.\u201cOhio is one of the most medically underserved states in the country, a problem particularly felt by Black communities, people of color, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in our state,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAnd access to telehealth services is a key tool in addressing these disparities.\u201dMore coverage:Planned Parenthood sues Ohio over its telemedicine abortion banOhio House sends Gov.
