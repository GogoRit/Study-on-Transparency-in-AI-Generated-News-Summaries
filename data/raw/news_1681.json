(AP) \u2014 South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster vowed Wednesday to press forward with efforts to further restrict abortion in the state.The Republican governor announced he would file a petition next week for a rehearing in his State of the State speech delivered less than three weeks after the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s ban as a violation of privacy.\u201cI remain optimistic that we will prevail in our historic fight to protect and defend the right to, and the sanctity of, life,\u201d McMaster said.McMaster also used the address to endorse an overhaul to the state\u2019s system of selecting judges that would give him more control over the process. South Carolina is one of two states where the Legislature selects members of the judiciary \u2014 all the way up to Supreme Court justices. McMaster called for gubernatorial appointments \u201cwith the advice and consent of the state Senate\u201d in a method that would resemble the federal government\u2019s model.\n\nA pending state Supreme Court decision also received attention. As justices weigh whether the electric chair or a firing squad are legal execution methods, McMaster tasked the General Assembly with passing a shield law to protect the identities of companies that provide lethal injection drugs. McMaster said doing so would free the companies to restock the state\u2019s depleted supply without fear of public pressure from activists against capital punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s top public health doctor warns senators wrong lessons being learned from COVID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTighter proposed South Carolina budget would include raises for teachers and state workers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootball powers converge to support South Carolina athlete compensation bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther developments gave the governor cause to celebrate. McMaster touted the state\u2019s record budget surplus of more than $3.5 billion and historic levels of capital investment amounting to over $10 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governor also took time in his speech to recognize guests present in the crowd, including business executives with RedWood Materials and BMW. The companies\u2019 respective announcements of new electric vehicle and battery plants both broke the previous record for the state\u2019s largest capital investment project.\n\nStill, McMaster criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s administration for \u201crun-away federal spending\u201d he said has threatened states with a potential recession in the coming year.The governor delivered the annual remarks before a joint session of the General Assembly. With state lawmakers present, McMaster pushed audience members to pass several policy goals.The speech featured support for education scholarship accounts. The Senate has spent the first weeks of session debating the program, which would provide public tax dollars for lower-income students to more easily pay for private schools with $6,000 vouchers. McMaster noted his budget proposal would set aside $25 million for the program.Democrats \u2014 the minority party in both legislative chambers \u2014 said to give credit where it is due. While excited by McMaster\u2019s projects expanding broadband and improving state infrastructure, state Sen. Ronnie Sabb of Williamsburg said those investments were made possible by the federal bipartisan infrastructure bill signed by Biden. Delivering the Democratic response to the State of the State, Sabb laid out his party\u2019s agenda. As the state\u2019s economy booms amid record investments, Sabb said the minimum wage \u2014 currently $7.25 per hour \u2014 should increase. He also pushed for hate crime legislation after an attempt to make South Carolina the 49th state with such a law stalled last year.\n\nSabb criticized the Republican priorities mentioned by McMaster. In the wake of renewed calls for an abortion ban, Sabb called for a ballot referendum allowing South Carolinians to decide the matter. He said the proposed education scholarship accounts amount to an unconstitutional plan to give taxpayer money to private, for profit schools.\u201cBoth of these issues challenge how we currently view personal rights in our state,\u201d Sabb said. \u201cBut yet again, we see a renewed effort by factions of Republican legislators to actually strip your liberties away.\u201d\u2014-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
