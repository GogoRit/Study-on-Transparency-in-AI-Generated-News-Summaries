(KLKN) \u2013 Acting Gov. Mike Foley, with the support of Gov. Ricketts, issued a proclamation recognizing a pro-life flag for Nebraska.\nThe proclamation states, \u201cpro-life supporters have created a pro-life flag to celebrate babies and the mothers who nurture them.\u201d\nThe flag\u2019s design includes the footprint of a child circled by a mother\u2019s hands, with two stripes highlighting the two lives present in pregnancy.\n\u201cIt is fitting and proper for Nebraskans to exercise their First Amendment rights to proclaim the human dignity of the unborn,\u201d states the proclamation.\nThe proclamation comes before the annual Walk for Life event at the State Capitol on Jan. 29th.\nMany state senators have introduced and supported pro-life legislation in this year\u2019s legislative session.\nOne bill, LB781, would ban abortions in Nebraska if a heartbeat is detected by an ultrasound.\nAndi Curry Grubb, State Executive Director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska has commented on recent pro-life legislation.\n\u201cNo ban on abortion is okay with us ever, and all of these are really working towards that same purpose. It\u2019s what they have been trying to do for years and again it doesn\u2019t reflect what the people of Nebraska want state senators to be spending their time on right now,\u201d said Grubb.\t\n\n\nCategories: Lancaster, Nebraska News, News \n\nTags: abortion, Mike Foley, Pete Ricketts, pro-life, proclamation \nFacebookPinterestTwitterLinkedin \n Download the Channel 8 News app\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska senator invokes colleague's name while reading rape scene during debate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan charged in killings at Nebraska bowling alley will undergo competency evaluation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all listings for Nebraska basketball tickets may be real, BBB warns \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska State Patrol made 10 DUI arrests over St. Patrick's Day weekend \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed\nLincoln Realtor says change to commissions will add 'substantial' cost for homebuyersAutopsy found 'no signs of violence' in body discovered near Waverly, deputy saysNebraska man seriously injured after trying to convert propane tank to smokerWoman injured in crash near Lincoln may have permanent brain damageLFR responds to crash in southwest Lincoln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured\n@NebraskaNowShowcase NebraskaSmall Business SaturdayLive Nebraska CamerasLinks We Mentioned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment News\nREO Speedwagon to perform at Lincoln's Pinewood BowlLincoln cinema screens best picture nominees ahead of OscarsLincoln Calling music festival announces 2024 lineup'Honky Tonk Man' Dwight Yoakam coming to LincolnLied Center announces 'Back to the Future,' 'Little Mermaid' and more Broadway shows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsNews\nLocal News\nNebraska News\nLinks We Mentioned\nCapitol News\nUS & World News\nConsumer\nHealth News\nEntertainment News\nGet News Alerts\nSubmit Your News\n \n\nLocal NewsFillmore\nGage\nJefferson\nLancaster\nSaline\nSeward\nYork\n \n\nWeatherWeather\n10-Day Outlook\nClosings & Delays\nFlight Tracker\nPower Outages\nWeather Radar\nYour Weather Photos\n \n\nTrafficTraffic\nTraffic Map\nSportsSports\nHusker Sports\nLPS Sports Live\nHigh School\n \n\nCommunityCommunity\nMagic Moments\nMidday Interviews\nCamp It: Nebraska Kids Camps\nKLKN Contests\nWatchWatch\nLive News\nVideo\nTV Schedule\nMr. Food\n \n\nAboutAbout\nChannel 8 News Team\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nClosed Captioning\nDMCA Agent\nFCC Public File\nEEO Report\nFCC Applications\nChildren\u2019s TV Report\nStandard Media Group\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\n \n\u00a9 2024 KLKN-TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 Copyright 2024 KLKN Lincoln Operations, LLC - A Standard Media Company - All Rights Reserved\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\nShare\nToggle Fullscreen\nZoom in/out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Previous\n Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
