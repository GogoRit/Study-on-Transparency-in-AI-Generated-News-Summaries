State Capitol on Tuesday, May 21, 2019 as part of a national day of action (Capital-Star photo).\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Abortion access throughout the country could soon depend on a patchwork of state laws if a U.S. Supreme Court dominated by conservatives overturns the constitutional right it established nearly 50 years ago.\nThe court\u2019s decision on Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban is expected sometime within the next two months. But state legislatures have been racing to prepare for the expected landmark ruling by shepherding new, vastly different pieces of legislation to their governors.\nRed states \u2014 which are responsible for a majority of the new laws \u2014 have enacted some of the strictest limits on abortion in decades. Meanwhile,\u00a0blue states have sought to secure abortion access as a fundamental right within their borders, as well as prepare for out-of-state women seeking to terminate their pregnancies.\nThere\u2019s much more to come, those familiar with the case predict. \u201cIf the court upholds the 15-week ban without a ton of guidance as to what other bans could be enforceable, there will be a six-week ban on their doorstep within a year or two,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate for state issues at the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion-rights research organization.\nIn total, 23 states now have laws on their books that would clamp down on abortion access should the U.S. Supreme Court rewrite abortion law or even overturn Roe v. Wade, though some laws are under challenge. They include Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Wyoming.\nSixteen states have laws that are expected to protect access,\u00a0according to the Guttmacher Institute. That group includes Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\nThere are several states, however, where it\u2019s not entirely clear what abortion laws would look like in the long term if the court acts to limit abortion access.\nAlaska, Florida,\u00a0Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, and Montana\u2019s state supreme courts have separately ruled that each state\u2019s Constitution protects the right to an abortion, according to\u00a0the Center for Reproductive Rights.\nSo even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns a national right to terminate a pregnancy and conservative lawmakers in those states want to enact restrictions, they might have problems \u2014 though some Republican-controlled states are already challenging the abortion protections in their states\u2019 constitutions.\nSeveral state governments are also prone to swinging between Democratic and Republican control, a trait that could lead to a change in abortion policy following each election.\nStates pick up their pace\nMomentum behind new state abortion laws increased after the U.S. Supreme Court heard\u00a0arguments\u00a0in December in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nThe case, from a health care provider in Mississippi, challenged a state law that would ban the vast majority of abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe Supreme Court has several paths it could take in deciding the case, but many antiabortion groups and even some abortion rights organizations believe the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority could end five decades of legal access across the United States.\nThe Supreme Court first established a fundamental right to an abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, though that\u2019s not the court\u2019s only ruling on abortion access.\nThese blue states are prepping to become abortion havens | Analysis\n\nThe 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling set the so-called viability standard. That ruling said women have the right to terminate a pregnancy without undue interference from the government until the point of viability, roughly 22 to 26 weeks into the pregnancy.\nOne possible path for conservative justices is ruling Roe was wrongly decided and that the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t guarantee the right to an abortion. That would leave each U.S. state to set its own abortion laws in line with its state constitution.\nA second potential ruling could say that Mississippi\u2019s abortion ban is an acceptable restriction on abortion access. That would signal that states are safe to enact abortion bans at 15 weeks or later in a pregnancy, but would leave some confusion about state bans below that threshold.\nA decision is expected before the court ends its spring term, which usually is in late June or early July.\nA string of new laws\nRepublican-controlled states have used the last few months to enact 15-week abortion bans, six-week bans, and so-called trigger bans that would go into effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned and abortion is made completely illegal.\nThe string of new laws began in early March when Florida\u2019s legislature\u00a0passed\u00a0a 15-week abortion ban, though Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis didn\u2019t\u00a0sign\u00a0the bill into law until mid-April. It would take effect July 1, pending a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union.\nArizona Republican lawmakers and Gov. Doug Ducey\u00a0approved\u00a0a similar 15-week ban in late March.\nNeither the Florida measure nor the Arizona law includes exceptions for women who become pregnant as the result of rape or incest.\nDemocrats in both states rallied against the legislation, with Florida Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book saying it was an \u201cassault on women\u2019s rights\u201d and Orange County state Sen. Randolph Bracy calling the lack of an exception for rape or incest \u201ccruel.\u201d\nAnalysis: Pa. among top 7 abortion rights battlegrounds in 2022 | Tuesday Morning Coffee\n\nBut Kelly Therrien, an antiabortion activist who\u00a0spoke\u00a0during a signing ceremony at the Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee, Florida, defended the law. She said that after becoming pregnant at 38, she went to get an abortion before deciding against it.\n\u201cNobody wanted my daughter. Her father said it\u2019s not mine, haven\u2019t heard from him for over four years. My parents wanted nothing to do with the pregnancy. My mother even took me for the abortion. When I got there, I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.\nTherrien went on to say that her parents love her now 3-year-old daughter, who she says was a \u201csurprise\u201d and not a \u201cmistake.\u201d\nIn Kentucky, Republican lawmakers this month overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear on a bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nThat legislation also doesn\u2019t include an exception for rape or incest, and Beshear objected.\n\u201cRape and incest are violent crimes,\u201d Beshear\u00a0wrote\u00a0in his veto message. \u201cVictims of these crimes should have options, not be further scarred through a process that exposes them to more harm from their rapists, or that treats them like offenders themselves.\u201d\nThe Kentucky law would greenlight a state database with the names and addresses of doctors who perform abortions, create a certification and monitoring program for those doctors, and make it illegal to mail prescription abortion medication.\nPlanned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0announced\u00a0they would file two lawsuits to stop the law.\nIn Pennsylvania\nThe fight over abortion rights has become a central plank in the 2022 campaign for governor. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, a one-time Planned Parenthood volunteer, will leave office in January 2023 after serving the constitutional maximum of two, four-year terms.\nThe York County pol has vetoed every Republican-authored bill restricting or banning abortion access that has come his way. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has vowed to be a similar bulwark against GOP attacks on abortion rights. Nine Republicans are seeking their party\u2019s nomination for the top spot in the May 17 primary. All oppose abortion rights.\nA proposed constitutional amendment declaring that there is no constitutional right to abortion or public funding for the procedure is now before the Republican-controlled state Senate. But it has not seen action since it cleared a key committee hurdle in January, the Capital-Star previously reported.\n\u2018Abortion rights are always on the ballot.\u2019 Advocates issue a call to action ahead of 2022 election\n\nDemocrats and reproductive health advocates have argue that the constitutional change \u2014 and a companion plan to implement a tiered funding system for family planning services \u2014 would restrict access to general health care, including physicals, pelvic exams, breast cancer screenings, and routine checkups.\nMore restrictions in states\u00a0\nOklahoma\u2019s GOP state government passed several laws, including one that makes abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in state prison, a maximum fine of $10,000, or both.\nThe law, signed in mid-April by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, doesn\u2019t include exceptions for rape or incest. It would not allow women to be criminally charged for obtaining an abortion.\nThe Biden administration admonished Oklahoma lawmakers for approving the law, with press secretary Jen Psaki calling it an \u201cunconstitutional attack on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\u201cMake no mistake: The actions today in Oklahoma are a part of a disturbing national trend attacking women\u2019s rights, and the Biden administration will continue to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures,\u201d she said.\nIn Idaho, the GOP legislature followed in the footsteps of a Texas law from 2021 that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, though private citizens would enforce the measure with civil lawsuits rather than state prosecutors bringing criminal cases.\nThe Idaho law, which would allow lawsuits against the doctor who performed the abortion, is currently on hold as the Idaho Supreme Court\u00a0reviews\u00a0it.\nIdaho Republican Gov. Brad Little wrote before signing the bill on March 23 that he supports the policy, but was concerned the legislation would \u201cbe proven both unconstitutional and unwise.\u201d\nBlue states\nGiven the action of neighboring states, Oregon began\u00a0preparing\u00a0for an influx of women seeking abortion access, in part by approving $15 million to establish the Oregon Reproductive Health Equity Fund.\nSeeding Justice, the Portland-based organization administering the funding, is likely to use the money to help women pay for travel for abortion access and other abortion-related programs.\n\u201cBarriers to abortion care have a disproportionate impact on people already facing multiple layers of discrimination: Those with low incomes, people of color, young people, immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people who live in rural communities are most impacted by these barriers.\u201d Executive Director Se-ah-dom Edmo said in a\u00a0statement.\nOther Democratic-controlled states have sought to expand access to abortion or secure it as a right during the past few months.\nThe Maryland General Assembly in early April\u00a0overrode GOP Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of a bill that would allow nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to perform abortions.\nHogan, who is term-limited, said in his veto letter that the measure would endanger \u201cthe health and lives of women by allowing non-physicians to perform abortions.\u201d\n\u201cThe only impact that this bill would have on women\u2019s reproductive rights would be to set back standards for women\u2019s health care and safety,\u201d Hogan\u00a0wrote.\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat,\u00a0signed\u00a0legislation that would maintain the \u201cstatus quo\u201d in the state should the Supreme Court undo precedent from previous abortion cases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely only a matter of time that the federal protections at the Supreme Court simply cease to exist,\u201d he said during a signing ceremony for the bill.\nMichigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has taken a somewhat different approach,\u00a0filing\u00a0a lawsuit in state court challenging a 1931 law that makes abortion criminal unless it\u2019s to protect the woman\u2019s life.\nThe suit could establish abortion as a right within Michigan\u2019s Constitution if its state Supreme Court rules the law violates the state\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and its due process clause, which includes privacy and bodily autonomy rights.\n\u201cNearly my whole life, this is a right that\u2019s afforded women the freedom to live and enjoy full rights to privacy and autonomy and equality as American citizens. All of that is in jeopardy,\u201d Whitmer said in an interview with\u00a0Michigan Advance. \u201cRegardless of why a woman might choose to exercise her rights in this regard, it is none of our business.\u201d\nOngoing action\nNot all the new abortion bills made it through to governors during state legislatures\u2019 annual sessions this year.\nThe Missouri House\u00a0blocked\u00a0legislation from Republican state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman that would have allowed citizens to file a lawsuit against anyone who helps a woman access abortion outside the state.\nAnd the Iowa House has yet to act on a bill state senators\u00a0approved\u00a0that would dole out $1 million to organizations that \u201chave a primary mission of promoting healthy pregnancies and childbirth instead of abortion.\u201d\nIn Montana, Attorney General Austin Knudsen has\u00a0asked\u00a0the state Supreme Court to overturn its 1999\u00a0ruling\u00a0in\u00a0Armstrong v. State\u00a0that abortion rights are guaranteed as part of the state Constitution.\nReproductive rights organizations are\u00a0asking\u00a0the court to uphold its prior ruling, saying in a filing that the Armstrong decision ensured \u201cindividuals, in particular members of marginalized communities, remain protected from state overreach into the most intimate and private zones of their lives.\u201d\nIn New Hampshire, lawmakers from both political parties are\u00a0working on legislation\u00a0that would amend the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban to include an exception for fatal fetal anomalies.\nMany Republicans,\u00a0who control the state House and Senate,\u00a0are backing the bill after hearing from women and doctors about their experiences.\n\u201cI just think the idea of a woman being forced to carry a fetus that has passed away is something that we should really address, as well as a child that is a fetus that can\u2019t possibly live outside the womb,\u201d said state Sen. Sharon Carson, a Londonderry Republican. \u201cI\u2019m a mother, and I can\u2019t imagine the pain and the suffering some of these women are going through.\u201d\nPublic opinion on abortion\nAmericans have remained fairly consistent in their beliefs about abortion during the last 20 years, according to Gallup\u00a0polling.\nIn 2001, 46% of respondents said they support abortion rights and 46% said they were antiabortion. That number fluctuated slightly during the last two decades, settling on 49% of people supporting abortion rights in 2021 while 47% identified as antiabortion.\nThe numbers get a bit more complicated when poll questions focus on specific court cases, exemptions and timing.\nA Washington Post-ABC News\u00a0poll\u00a0from November showed that 60% of people want the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Roe v. Wade compared to 27% who want it overturned and 12% with no opinion.\nIn the same poll, 36% of respondents said they support states passing legislation that makes it more difficult for abortion clinics to operate, while 58% said they oppose it and 6% had no opinion.\nWhen asked about the Texas law that allows anyone in the country to file a lawsuit against anyone who performs an abortion or assists a woman in accessing one after six weeks of pregnancy, 65% said the U.S. Supreme Court should reject the law and 29% said the justices should uphold it as constitutional.\nIn total, 75% of those surveyed said they think the decision about abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor, while 20% said it should be regulated by law and 5% had no opinion.\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t completely overturn the constitutional right to an abortion but allows Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban to stand, Nash of the Guttmacher Institute expects next year\u2019s legislative sessions will host another wave of legislation.\n\u201cI think, broadly, the intent would be that these conservative legislatures would continue to push for total abortion bans,\u201d Nash said. \u201cThat has been the goal since Roe was handed down in 1973. And it doesn\u2019t make sense that a decision short of completely overturning Roe would be a deterrent for them.\u201d\nCapital-Star Editor John L.

Jared Polis, a Democrat,\u00a0signed\u00a0legislation that would maintain the \u201cstatus quo\u201d in the state should the Supreme Court undo precedent from previous abortion cases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely only a matter of time that the federal protections at the Supreme Court simply cease to exist,\u201d he said during a signing ceremony for the bill.\nMichigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has taken a somewhat different approach,\u00a0filing\u00a0a lawsuit in state court challenging a 1931 law that makes abortion criminal unless it\u2019s to protect the woman\u2019s life.\nThe suit could establish abortion as a right within Michigan\u2019s Constitution if its state Supreme Court rules the law violates the state\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and its due process clause, which includes privacy and bodily autonomy rights.\n\u201cNearly my whole life, this is a right that\u2019s afforded women the freedom to live and enjoy full rights to privacy and autonomy and equality as American citizens. All of that is in jeopardy,\u201d Whitmer said in an interview with\u00a0Michigan Advance. \u201cRegardless of why a woman might choose to exercise her rights in this regard, it is none of our business.\u201d\n    Ongoing action\n\n\t\nNot all the new abortion bills made it through to governors during state legislatures\u2019 annual sessions this year.\nThe Missouri House\u00a0blocked\u00a0legislation from Republican state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman that would have allowed citizens to file a lawsuit against anyone who helps a woman access abortion outside the state.\nAnd the Iowa House has yet to act on a bill state senators\u00a0approved\u00a0that would dole out $1 million to organizations that \u201chave a primary mission of promoting healthy pregnancies and childbirth instead of abortion.\u201d\nIn Montana, Attorney General Austin Knudsen has\u00a0asked\u00a0the state Supreme Court to overturn its 1999\u00a0ruling\u00a0in\u00a0Armstrong v. State\u00a0that abortion rights are guaranteed as part of the state Constitution.\nReproductive rights organizations are\u00a0asking\u00a0the court to uphold its prior ruling, saying in a filing that the Armstrong decision ensured \u201cindividuals, in particular members of marginalized communities, remain protected from state overreach into the most intimate and private zones of their lives.\u201d\nIn New Hampshire, lawmakers from both political parties are\u00a0working on legislation\u00a0that would amend the state\u2019s 24-week abortion ban to include an exception for fatal fetal anomalies.\nMany Republicans,\u00a0who control the state House and Senate,\u00a0are backing the bill after hearing from women and doctors about their experiences.\n\u201cI just think the idea of a woman being forced to carry a fetus that has passed away is something that we should really address, as well as a child that is a fetus that can\u2019t possibly live outside the womb,\u201d said state Sen. Sharon Carson, a Londonderry Republican. \u201cI\u2019m a mother, and I can\u2019t imagine the pain and the suffering some of these women are going through.\u201d\n    Public opinion on abortion\n\n\t\nAmericans have remained fairly consistent in their beliefs about abortion during the last 20 years, according to Gallup\u00a0polling.\nIn 2001, 46% of respondents said they support abortion rights and 46% said they were antiabortion. That number fluctuated slightly during the last two decades, settling on 49% of people supporting abortion rights in 2021 while 47% identified as antiabortion.\nThe numbers get a bit more complicated when poll questions focus on specific court cases, exemptions and timing.\nA Washington Post-ABC News\u00a0poll\u00a0from November showed that 60% of people want the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Roe v. Wade compared to 27% who want it overturned and 12% with no opinion.\nIn the same poll, 36% of respondents said they support states passing legislation that makes it more difficult for abortion clinics to operate, while 58% said they oppose it and 6% had no opinion.\nWhen asked about the Texas law that allows anyone in the country to file a lawsuit against anyone who performs an abortion or assists a woman in accessing one after six weeks of pregnancy, 65% said the U.S. Supreme Court should reject the law and 29% said the justices should uphold it as constitutional.\nIn total, 75% of those surveyed said they think the decision about abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor, while 20% said it should be regulated by law and 5% had no opinion.\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t completely overturn the constitutional right to an abortion but allows Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban to stand, Nash of the Guttmacher Institute expects next year\u2019s legislative sessions will host another wave of legislation.\n\u201cI think, broadly, the intent would be that these conservative legislatures would continue to push for total abortion bans,\u201d Nash said. \u201cThat has been the goal since Roe was handed down in 1973. And it doesn\u2019t make sense that a decision short of completely overturning Roe would be a deterrent for them.\u201d\nCapital-Star Editor John L.
