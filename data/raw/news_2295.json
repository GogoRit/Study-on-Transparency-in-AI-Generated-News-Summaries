It was included in court preparations to hear June Medical Services v. Gee, a landmark case reviewing a Louisiana law that requires doctors performing an abortion to have admitting privileges at a state-approved hospital within 30 miles of their clinic.\nBut some women report feeling differently. A woman from Wisconsin wrote in to Abort 73, a pro-life website, about her regrets.Advertisements\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been one month since I had my abortion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd here I am at 2 a.m., looking for some way to relieve my feelings of grief and regret. I\u2019ve never been so disappointed and ashamed of myself. I robbed myself of what would have been the greatest gift of my life, and I continue to pay the price every day.\u201d\nAs the issue makes its way through state legislative branches and reaches the nation\u2019s highest court, the debate surrounding it has received new vigor. Citizens have made their stances clear, whether by engaging in political activism or simply making how they feel known on social media, and the topic sizzles across the country.\nProceeding with Caution\nIn Wisconsin, abortion laws involve some restriction. According to Affiliated Medical Services, a Wisconsin women\u2019s clinic, state law dictates a woman must visit with a counselor and physician before she can proceed with an abortion and prohibits abortion after 21 weeks.\nDuring the visit, physicians conduct health exams, verify the pregnancy and measure how far along it is. But according to the Department of Health Services\u2019 \u201cA Woman\u2019s Right to Know\u201d document, law requires a woman receive \u201cprinted materials.\u201d\nThese include descriptions and imagery of fetal development every two weeks during pregnancy, a statement on fetal pain, potential harmful emotional effects following abortion and services that might provide assistance throughout pregnancy, delivery and raising a child.\nThe materials also include information on the medical risks of pregnancy and childbirth.\nA woman seeking abortion must also sign an Abortion Information Provision Certification Form issued by the state. According to DHS, signing it means you agree your doctor has discussed medical risks associated with the chosen abortion procedure, probable age of the embryo or fetus at the time the abortion is scheduled and eligibility for medical coverage of prenatal and newborn care.\nThe document also noted a doctor must discuss medical risks if a woman decides to carry pregnancy to term.\nFollowing that, if a woman decides to have an abortion, she must return to the clinic no sooner than 24 hours after the initial meeting for the procedure. This means to receive an abortion, a woman must make two trips to the clinic.\nData published by DHS stated there were 5,640 induced abortions in 2017, the most recent year for which data has been released. This was a 3% increase from 2016. But there was a notable downwards trend: in 1987, the number of abortions in the state was 17,318. This is despite an increase in state population by almost one million people from 1987 to 2017, according to MacroTrends.\nIn 2017, women aged 20 to 24 also accounted for 30% of reported induced abortions, the largest proportion of any age group.\nA Battleground State\nAs Wisconsin\u2019s reported abortion rates have decreased over time, activism has flourished. This has been notable in the cropping up of organizations furthering their goals in Wisconsin.\nMel Barnes, Director of Policy and Legal Advocacy at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said PPWI has provided care to nearly 60,000 people at their 24 health centers in Wisconsin. Barnes said PPWI \u201cbelieves that people should be able to make their own health care decisions without interference by politicians.\u201d\nBarnes noted her opinion on Wisconsin law.\n\u201cWisconsin has medically unnecessary laws that restrict the ability for people to access the care they need,\u201d Barnes said.\u00a0\nBarnes also said PPWI is challenging some of those restrictions in an ongoing lawsuit.\nKristen Nupson, Legislative Director at Wisconsin Right to Life, was more positive, however.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the work that we have done in Wisconsin,\u201d Nupson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve passed things like ultrasound laws, and right-to-know bills, things that really make sure \u2026 women are not in emotionally vulnerable positions when they\u2019re making these decisions.\u201d\nWRTL, Nupson said, is a pro-life organization that \u201cbelieves that life is valued from conception until natural death.\u201d\nNupson discussed her Christian faith, citing her religious upbringing as her introduction to the pro-life stance. She said she believes God has \u201cmade pretty clear in the Bible that life is valued from conception,\u201d and has become a staunch advocate of \u201cprotecting and valuing life\u201d from said conception point.\nWhen discussing opposition, Nupson said she\u2019s seen protesters and heard a lot of narratives about the pro-life movement \u2014 ones she finds inaccurate.\n\u201cA lot of people say that the pro-life movement is just white men trying to control women\u2019s bodies, but as a woman, I would disagree with that,\u201d Nupson said. \u201cMy goal is not to tell people what they can and cannot do, it\u2019s to change hearts and minds.\u201d\nBarnes said \u201cthe majority of people in Wisconsin and across the country are supportive\u201d of Planned Parenthood, noting one in five women in the U.S. has been a patient there.\u00a0\nWhile she acknowledged a \u201csmall but vocal minority\u201d of people who oppose Planned Parenthood, she said their focus \u201cis always on our patients and making sure that people have access to the health care that they need.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood provides a plethora of healthcare services, including abortion services, birth control, cancer screenings and men\u2019s health services. It also provides recommendations and referrals to prenatal care and tips on feeding newborns.\u00a0\nRegarding WRTL, Nupson noted many who oppose the pro-life movement often say it \u201cabandons women\u201d after their pregnancies, and WRTL helps make sure that\u2019s not the case.\n\u201cWe want to come alongside women and show that they are capable of raising a child \u2026 we can help provide tools to make them successful,\u201d Nupson said. \u201cIf they still feel like they can\u2019t handle that, there are other options, like adoption.\u201d\nWRTL has awarded emergency grants to women in immediate financial crisis to allow them to continue their pregnancies, promoted toll-free helplines and has worked with teenagers and college students in statewide conferences.\nBoth Barnes and Nupson said the subject is complex, and there will always be people who aren\u2019t sure or disagree with them.\n\u201cWe know that some people have complicated feelings about abortion, and that\u2019s okay,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cOur job at Planned Parenthood is to make sure that people have the information that they need to make decisions about their own health care. We\u2019re here to support our patients no matter what.\u201d\nNupson added she doesn\u2019t take it to heart.\n\u201cI think the biggest thing is to not feel attacked or hurt when other people don\u2019t agree with me \u2014 that\u2019s fine,\u201d Nupson said. \u201cBut obviously I\u2019m passionate about what I do, and I want people to be educated on this issue.\u201d\nDespite differences, they both agreed unequivocally on one thing. Their primary goal is to provide support and assistance to those who needed it.\u00a0\nBiological Bases, Ethical Stances\nNupson cited science as a tool she uses to support her stance.\n\u201cThankfully, here in the pro-life movement, I believe we have science on our side,\u201d Nupson said. \u201cI think the most basic principle on this issue is that in biology, something is considered a life when an egg and a sperm come together.\u201d\nAlta Charo, Warren P. Knowles Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin, on leave as a Berggruen Fellow at the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, noted the ethical debate on abortion can stem from certain biological assumptions, like ones Nupson discussed.\nBut Charo noted certain discrepancies that allowed for debate on even what some would think was solid ground.\n\u201cFor some, moral status is ascribed from the moment of fertilization, though in fact there is no such single moment, as it is a process: sperm preparation, sperm-egg recognition and binding, sperm-egg fusion and fusion of sperm and egg pronuclei and activation of the zygote,\u201d Charo said.\nCharo noted for some, the fact an egg is fertilized is enough to inform their views.\n\u201cFor [some] people, any loss of a fertilized egg \u2026 is equivalent to the death of a live born child, and the issue is whether the loss was incurred naturally, accidentally or intentionally,\u201d Charo said.\u00a0\nFor those people, she said, a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest will not excuse abortion, as it is still intentional killing.\nCharo said for other people, the main issue is whether the pregnancy is intentional or not. Despite their general view that abortion is not acceptable, she noted some would permit abortions in the case of rape, where the woman played no consenting role in becoming pregnant.\nShe said an intentional abortion could sometimes be excused by those who typically oppose it if needed to save the life of a pregnant woman, \u201cbut there is wide variation on how liberally or strictly one defines\u201d what a threat to her life is.\nCharo said for those who are tolerant of abortion, the issue becomes two-fold. The first issue lies in the belief a pregnant woman is entitled to rights over her own body, therefore entitled to make decisions about her pregnancy.\n\u201c[The second issue is] the moral status of the embryo/fetus depends \u2026 largely on whether development has progressed to the point that the growing fetus can have any sense of its environment, of pain, or of itself \u2013 [the] kind of sentience that would trigger full \u2018personhood\u2019 in the philosophical sense,\u201d Charo said.\nNupson noted in her effort to educate people on the subject of abortion, she actively discussed things like when a fetus can feel pain and have a heartbeat \u2014\u00a0factors she said can help people see fetuses as \u201chaving humanity\u201d or personhood.\nCharo said it is important to remember \u201cno particular religious view can be adopted into law solely because it is a preferred or dominant religion.\u201d She added there should be a line of reasoning in policy that allows for even those of different religious backgrounds to agree with.\nCharo noted her own opinion on the subject as well.\n\u201cMy view is that rights attach when they can be appreciated,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil a growing human fetus has the capacity to appreciate its environment in even a minimal fashion, there is no right to continued development that can outweigh the undisputed right of a pregnant woman to control her own body.\u201d\nCampus Divides\nKathleen McLoone, a sophomore at UW, agrees with Charo.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely pro-choice,\u201d McLoone said. \u201cI believe that a woman\u2019s body is her choice and what she wants out of her life is more important than a fetus. The fact that people are trying to control that is wrong.\u201d\nMcLoone, who hails from Stanley, Wisconsin, described her town as very conservative. She says that in part stems from the Christian backgrounds that are common there, and added it\u2019s uncommon to talk about subjects like abortion.\n\u00a0\u201cPeople are a lot more uncomfortable there, talking about things like that,\u201d McLoone said.\nMcLoone said in Stanley, her stance is relatively uncommon, but youth were more likely to share it. She added coming to UW \u201cwas a breath of fresh air. I felt suffocated sometimes in my own town and have been able to expand here.\u201d\nTom, a sophomore at UW who asked to go by first name only, discussed \u201cleaning pro-choice.\u201d But he also discussed the difficulties of grappling with that \u2014 he had been pro-life previously and still tries to balance all the facets of the issue today.\n\u201cI was pro-life for a long time growing up,\u201d Tom said, citing his conservative surroundings and private Christian education as influences.\u00a0\nTom said he\u2019d always had doubts about how exactly to gauge his standing, however.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d always had the thought where I could never truly understand what it\u2019s like to be in a situation where I\u2019d have to make that decision,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI started thinking a lot more about it in high school.\u201d\nAt his Christian high school, he said he had teachers repeatedly compare the legalization of abortion to the Holocaust. He described rallies where his peers would have signs saying \u201cProtect God\u2019s Children\u201d and go onto the streets.\nTom described how coming to UW helped further his curiosities on the topic.\n\u201cAs I got exposed to more things, I\u2019d already been questioning this very firm pro-life stance my peers had,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBy the time I got to UW, I wasn\u2019t a fish out of water, but it reinforced the questions I had.\u201d\nHe stressed, however, that it\u2019s a complex topic \u2014 one he and many others who hail from similar backgrounds at the UW will likely internally debate for a long time.\nJacob, a junior at the UW who asked to go by first name only, spoke bitterly of reactions to being pro-life on campus.\n\u201cThere\u2019s people who are pro-life here, but what\u2019s problematic to me is that I feel like we need to be quiet about it,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cI get that this is a really polarizing time, and I\u2019m always down to have conversations. But it always devolves into something where I feel like they\u2019re yelling at me about everything. I\u2019ll yell back, so I\u2019m not innocent here and I\u2019m sure [pro-choice] people feel that way too, but it makes me want to not say anything about it.\u201d\nJacob cited a \u201cwant to protect unborn life that can\u2019t defend itself yet\u201d as why he\u2019s pro-life. While he said he didn\u2019t want to infringe on a woman\u2019s right to her own body, he didn\u2019t want to also infringe on what he believes is the \u201cinherent right to life a fetus deserves.\u201d\u00a0\nJacob added, however, he didn\u2019t think those who are pro-choice are bad people.\n\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to protect somebody or something we care about, and that\u2019s where we should all respect each other,\u201d Jacob said.\u00a0\nTom agreed, noting that approaching the conversation with respect in mind was key. And, he added, he certainly hadn\u2019t made changes to his stance because people shouted at him.\n\u201cI look at the similarities of intentions on every side. They\u2019re motivated by really similar things, and I believe they\u2019re all trying to do the right thing,\u201d Tom said. \u201cYou should go into a conversation not thinking about how wrong someone is, but about their underlying motivations. That\u2019s where the common ground is probably going to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLeave a Comment\n\n\nabortionplanned parenthoodpolicypro choicepro lifeUWwisconsin right to life\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate to The Badger Herald\n\n\nYour donation will support the student journalists of University of Wisconsin-Madison.
