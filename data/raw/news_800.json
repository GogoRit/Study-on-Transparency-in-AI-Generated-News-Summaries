Kim Reynolds said in a statement that she would appeal the decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.\nCurrent state law bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but Reynolds\u00a0asked the courts to reverse\u00a0the 2019 decision that blocked a bill she had signed into law the previous year. That law prohibited abortions once cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 the\u00a0\u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d\u00a0concept \u2014 which usually happens around six weeks of pregnancy and is often before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\nReynolds argued that because of decisions earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Iowa Supreme Court that found woman have no constitutional right to abortion, the Iowa judge should reverse the 2019 decision blocking the abortion law.\nREAD MORE: Indiana doctor defends actions in 10-year-old rape victim\u2019s abortion\nLawyers for Iowa\u2019s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, countered that there is no precedent or legal support for reversing a decision finalized by a judge years earlier. They said Reynolds must go through the legislative process to pass a new law.\nReynolds did not appeal the decision when it was handed down in 2019.\nAt that time, Judge Michael Huppert\u2019s decision was based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent, as well as an Iowa Supreme Court decision in 2018 that declared abortion a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution.\nReynolds, who supports outlawing abortions, decided to turn to the courts to impose stricter abortion limits instead of calling a special session of the legislature to pass a new law.\nAlthough Iowa\u2019s law blocked by the courts seeks to prevent abortions when a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d can be detected, this does not easily translate to medical science. That\u2019s because the point where advanced technology can detect that first visual flutter, the embryo isn\u2019t yet a fetus, and it doesn\u2019t have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus eight weeks after fertilization.\nThe Iowa law contains exceptions for medical emergencies, including threats to the mother\u2019s life, rape, incest, and fetal abnormality.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Republican Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, running for re-election as the Governor of Iowa in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, talks about student debt during the 5th Annual Harvest Festival at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., October 1, 2022.
