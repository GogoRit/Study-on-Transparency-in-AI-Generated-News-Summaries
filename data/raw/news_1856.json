(AP) \u2014 Abortion providers in North Carolina filed a federal lawsuit Friday that challenges several provisions of a\u00a0state law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy\u00a0in the dwindling days before the new restrictions take effect.\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic and Dr. Beverly Gray, an OB-GYN at Duke Health, are asking a federal judge to block numerous provisions they argue are unclear and unconstitutional, or to place an injunction on the law to prevent it from being enforced.\nThough the law may be commonly referred to as a 12-week abortion ban, the plaintiffs argue that it actually includes additional restrictions that many patients are not aware of \u2014 hurdles that will \u201cimpede health care professionals from providing quality care,\u201d according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.\n\u201cMany of these provisions are going to constrain an already very constrained abortion ecosystem in this state,\u201d Planned Parenthood South Atlantic CEO Jenny Black told The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cAnd so we really thought it was important that we challenged the elements of the law that do that.\u201d\nNorth Carolina has been one of the few remaining Southern states with relatively easy access to abortions in the wake of last year\u2019s\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court decision\u00a0to strip away constitutional protections for abortion. With the new restrictions set to take effect July 1, many out-of-state patients who had once viewed North Carolina as a refuge for care will soon have to travel even further up the coast to access abortions later in pregnancy.\nREAD MORE: \u2018Our act of defiance\u2019 \u2014 why Planned Parenthood is launching its 1st mobile clinic\nThe lawsuit comes one month after the Republican supermajority in the state\u2019s General Assembly fast-tracked the measure through both chambers and overrode a\u00a0veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who called it \u201can egregious, unacceptable attack on the women of our state.\u201d\nHe and other abortion-rights supporters have raised concerns about several provisions addressed in the complaint, including one that the plaintiffs argue could prevent providers from performing a medication abortion after 10 weeks of pregnancy, despite another provision stating it\u2019s lawful through 12 weeks.\nThat is one example of the contradictory and confusing nature of the law, said lead attorney Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. \u201cThe lack of clarity and vagueness run through,\u201d she said.\nAmong the named defendants are North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, state Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kody Kinsley and the district attorneys who represent every county in the state where Gray and Planned Parenthood provide abortions.\nKinsley\u2019s and Stein\u2019s offices did not immediately respond Friday to emails seeking comment.\nREAD MORE: America\u2019s religious leaders sharply divided over abortion, a year after Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal\nIn the lead-up to July 1, Black said Planned Parenthood staff members have been coming in early and working through lunch to treat as many patients as possible, while stressing to others that \u201ctime is of the essence.\u201d\nRepublicans had pitched the 47-page measure as a middle-ground change to an existing state law banning nearly all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest. The new law adds exceptions, extending the limit through 20 weeks for rape and incest and through 24 weeks for \u201clife-limiting\u201d fetal anomalies, including certain physical or genetic disorders that can be diagnosed prenatally.\nBut abortion-rights advocates say limits on those exceptions, as well as new hurdles for patients and providers, make the law much more restrictive than the headline-grabbing 12-week limit conveys.\nThe lawsuit challenges a requirement that sexual assault survivors obtain abortions at a hospital after 12 weeks of pregnancy, rather than at one of the many clinics Planned Parenthood and other providers operate around the state.\nGray, an OB-GYN who provides care in a hospital setting, told the AP there is no procedural or medical difference between the unrestricted care she is able to provide miscarriage patients and the newly restricted care she provides abortion patients.\nREAD MORE: North Carolina GOP votes to censure Sen. Tillis for support of LGBTQ+ rights, gun policies\nSimilarly, Planned Parenthood clinics will be able to continue treating miscarriage patients after 12 weeks in cases where the fetus has already died but will be prohibited from providing identical care to rape and incest survivors in the context of an abortion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same care, and there\u2019s zero regulations about caring for patients with miscarriages,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThis is not about safety. This is about limiting access to abortion.\u201d\nTheir complaint also seeks clarity on a provision that prohibits providers from advising how a person can access an abortion after 12 weeks, which Amiri said could violate the First Amendment if the court interprets it as preventing providers from helping patients access care in other states where it remains legal.\nAmiri also raised concern about what she said was likely \u201ca doozy of a drafting error\u201d related to the state\u2019s existing fetal homicide statute, which considers it homicide to willfully cause the death of an unborn child. That law contains exceptions for lawful abortions, but Amiri said when legislators replaced the abortion law, they removed the statutory reference for those exceptions.\n\u201cIt leaves open the question of whether lawful abortion could be prosecuted under the fetal homicide statutes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very concerning for everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Demonstrators hold signs as North Carolina Republican lawmakers hold a vote to override Democratic Governor Roy Cooper's veto of a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after 12 weeks, in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S. May 16, 2023.
