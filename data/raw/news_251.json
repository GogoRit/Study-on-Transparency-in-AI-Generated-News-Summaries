The group collected around 138,500 signatures in what they described as a grass roots effort. The signatures were due today to get the initiative on the ballot, which would restrict abortion rights in Colorado in the same day the Supreme Court is heading a case on abortion access restrictions. Due Date Too Late hopes to end late-term abortion in Colorado in 2020. The group says that Colorado is one of only a few states that allows abortion for any reason up until birth with no restrictions. They hope to enact a 22-week abortion ban.\n(Photo by Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post)\t\t\n\nBy Saja Hindi | shindi@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: March 18, 2020 at 6:12 p.m. | UPDATED: March 18, 2020 at 6:16 p.m.One of the sponsors of a ballot initiative to ban late-term abortions in Colorado has sued the Secretary of State\u2019s Office for more time to collect signatures.\nThe group will only move forward with the lawsuit, though, if the signatures turned in are found insufficient to qualify for the November ballot, according to attorney Suzanne Staiert, a former deputy secretary of state.\nThe Due Date Too Late organizers have also appealed to the Secretary of State\u2019s Office to grant them more time than the allotted 15-day cure period to get valid signatures because of coronavirus concerns, the campaign told supporters in an email.\nIf the measure makes it onto the ballot, voters will be asked to decide whether the state should ban abortions at 22 weeks and later.\nDue Date Too Late co-sponsor Giuliana Day filed the lawsuit March 4 in Denver District Court \u2014 the same day that the campaign turned in approximately 137,624 signatures. They must have 124,632 valid signatures to make the ballot. The lawsuit was first reported by the Colorado Times Recorder.\nThe group will have 15 days to collect additional signatures if the Secretary of State\u2019s Office says it doesn\u2019t have enough. \n\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the office\u2019s deadlines conflict with the Colorado Constitution. The campaign wants to be able to circulate petitions until Aug. 3, the constitutional deadline for initiative petitions to be filed for the November election, according to the complaint. But Colorado law requires that petitions be filed within six months of the titles being set and no later than three months and three weeks before an election \u2014 in Due Date Too Late\u2019s case, March 4.\nRelated Articles\nElection |  \n\n\t\t\tOpinion: We are Colorado IVF families and the Alabama ruling should scare everyone\t\t\n\n\nElection |  \n\n\t\t\tIn Denver, Vice President Kamala Harris promises to fight for \u201cassault\u201d weapons ban and abortion access\t\t\n\n\nElection |  \n\n\t\t\tAsked to clear up abortion bans, GOP leaders blame doctors and misinformation for the confusion\t\t\n\n\nElection |  \n\n\t\t\tWyoming banned abortion.

That analysis is triggered when a random sample of signatures indicates the total verified will land between 90% and 110% of the required number.\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPolicies\nReport an Error\nContact Us\nSubmit a News Tip\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularColorado\u2019s first Buc-ee\u2019s opens its doors with Texas brisket, beaver nuggets and super-clean restroomsColorado's first Buc-ee's opens its doors with Texas brisket, beaver nuggets and super-clean restroomsUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at Westminster school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at Westminster school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesNikola Jokic, Nuggets react to Kyrie Irving buzzer beater hook shot in Dallas: \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of basketball\u201dNikola Jokic, Nuggets react to Kyrie Irving buzzer beater hook shot in Dallas: \"That's the beauty of basketball\"Under Colorado\u2019s new water-saving law, here\u2019s where ornamental grass will be banned starting in 2026Under Colorado's new water-saving law, here's where ornamental grass will be banned starting in 2026Avalanche defenseman sells mansion in Denver\u2019s Belcaro neighborhood for $3.75MAvalanche defenseman sells mansion in Denver's Belcaro neighborhood for $3.75MJudge finds sexual assault claim against Colorado lawmaker \u201cincredible,\u201d casting doubt on allegationsJudge finds sexual assault claim against Colorado lawmaker \"incredible,\" casting doubt on allegationsKeeler: NCAA Tournament selection committees did CU Buffs, CSU Rams dirtyKeeler: NCAA Tournament selection committees did CU Buffs, CSU Rams dirtyAvalanche\u2019s Nathan MacKinnon after incredible battle with Oilers: \u201cThat game means a little more\u201dAvalanche's Nathan MacKinnon after incredible battle with Oilers: \"That game means a little more\"March Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentMarch Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentAssault weapons ban, single-stair development, air-quality bills in the Colorado legislature this weekAssault weapons ban, single-stair development, air-quality bills in the Colorado legislature this week \n\n\n\nTrending Nationally\nCalifornia\u2019s largest new reservoir project in 50 years gains momentumUnsupervised child in wheelchair broke both legs at school after sliding down ramp, lawsuit allegesMarch Madness 2024: Printable bracket for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournamentSocial media influencer arrested in Irvine on suspicion of joining the attack on the US CapitolInvestigators hunted one of Florida\u2019s most prolific serial rapists for decades.
