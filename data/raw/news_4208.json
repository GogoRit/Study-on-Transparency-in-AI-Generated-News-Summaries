Now more than ever it is vital that we stand with candidates who stand with Planned Parenthood, and who are committed to guaranteeing reproductive health care for Ohioans, regardless of their income, zip code, or insurance status.\nStatement from Bridgette Tupes, Board Chair at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio:\n\u201cOhio is ground zero for irresponsible and dangerous federal and state policy targeting reproductive health care access, education, and funding. Our health care is under constant threat because of the restrictions passed by former governor John Kasich and now Gov. Mike DeWine. We need elected officials who our patients and supporters can count on \u2013 who will, without reservation, preserve and invest in reproductive health care and sexual health education for all Ohioans.\u201d\nOur endorsed reproductive rights defenders:\nSen. Vernon Sykes, District 28\nRep. Phil Robinson, District 6\nRep. Kent Smith, District 8\nRep. Janine Boyd, District 9\nRep. Terrence Upchurch, District 10\nRep. Stephanie Howse, District 11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRep. Juanita Brent, District 12\nRep. Mike Skindell, District 13\nRep. Bride Rose Sweeney, District 14\nRep. Adam Miller, District 17\nRep. Kristin Boggs, District 18\nRep. Mary Lightbody, District 19\nRep. Rich Brown, District 20\nRep. Beth Liston, District 20\nRep. David Leland, District 22\nRep. Allison Russo, District 24\nRep. Erica Crawley, District 26\nRep. Jessica Miranda, District 28\nRep. Brigid Kelly, District 31\nRep. Catherine Ingram, District 32\nRep. Sedrick Denson, District 33\nMinority Leader Emilia Sykes, District 34\nRep. Tavia Galonski, District 35\nRep. Casey Weinstein, District 37\nRep. Paula Hicks-Hudson, District 44\nRep. Lisa Sobecki, District 45\nRep. Michael Sheehy, District 46\nRep. Michele Lepore-Hagan, District 58\nRep. Thomas West, District 49\nRep. Randi Clites, District 75\nThe 30 candidates PPAO has endorsed represent communities all over Ohio that benefit from access to sexual and reproductive health care and education. PPAO represents 23 health centers in both of Ohio\u2019s Planned Parenthood affiliates, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region. More than 80,000 patients received services from Planned Parenthood health centers in Ohio last year.\nThese endorsed candidates have demonstrated their commitment to defending bodily autonomy for their constituents. We look forward to working with these dedicated civil servants to not only protect, but expand access to reproductive health care in Ohio.\n###\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio supports advocacy for reproductive health and reproductive rights, including grassroots organizing, community education, and lobbying. www.ppao.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is controlled and operated by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio Inc..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is controlled and operated by\u00a0Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio and Planned Parenthood Votes Ohio.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nLegislation\n\n\nMedia\n\n\n\n\nDonate\nToggle Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
