achievementKiernan Dunlopkdunlop@s-t.comNEW BEDFORD \u2014 Over a century ago lifelong Fairhaven resident Elizabeth Terry Delano added her voice to a national cause.The well-known local artist put pen to paper and sent a letter to the Fairhaven Star urging Congress to grant full suffrage to women.Delano wasn\u2019t the only woman with SouthCoast ties to fight for women\u2019s suffrage, and this year local women are recognizing what they and other SouthCoast women have accomplished before and in the 100 years since the 19th amendment was ratified in 1920.Organizations around New Bedford are celebrating the centennial of women\u2019s suffrage, but they are also highlighting that work still has to be done for women\u2019s rights and to make voting a universal right.The New Bedford Whaling Museum is commemorating the anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage through its Lighting the Way Project, which works to highlight the historical impact of women from the region.\u00a0\u201c2020 is really significant because it is the 100th anniversary of ratifying the 19th amendment\u2026 and that\u2019s incredibly important but it\u2019s not the full story,\u201d Catherine Saunders, project coordinator for Lighting the Way, said. \u201cThat was a long fight and it only made it so someone can\u2019t be denied just because of their sex, but you can deny them from voting for other reasons.\u201dStates that required voters to own property or pass a literacy test or pay a poll tax kept some women and men from voting even after the 19th amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920, particularly women of color and poor women.Lighting the Way is working to highlight the history of women in the region as well known as men\u2019s history, through compiling their stories on a website and in an interactive app that allows you to tour the city and learn women\u2019s stories at different historical landmarks.Events also celebrating the anniversary include IGNITE: A Youth Showcase of Art Inspired by Historic Women of the SouthCoast presented in partnership with the YWCA on March 12.Suffragists are among those historic women in the SouthCoast, according to Saunders, though only a few have been confirmed as suffragists.The reason for that could be that women\u2019s history was not very well documented, Saunders said, and women who were active in politics were seen as quirky.\u201cThere were women in the SouthCoast, who may not have identified as suffragists, but who worked to secure rights and voting access for these women as well as for men who did not have it,\u201d a statement announcing the Whaling Museum\u2019s centennial celebrations said.Suffragists who have been identified include artists Elizabeth Terry Delano and Cecil Clary Davis, physician Dr. Marie Equi, and educator Elizabeth Piper Ensley.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that artists are the activists here,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cIt\u2019s partly because they were of a class that had the free time to be interested in and engaging in political activity.\u201d\u201cCecil (Clary Davis) was another person who defied the typical expectation,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cShe traveled a lot, she was very active in the women's movement, and she put off getting married for a long time because she didn\u2019t just want to be in a subservient relationship.\u201dDavis, who summered in Marion and won several awards for her art, was active in the suffrage movement from 1911-16, attending suffrage meetings and parades, and working on a suffrage cartoon and designing a poster for a suffrage parade, according to the Lighting the Way project\u2019s website.Equi went from being a high school dropout working in the textile mills of New Bedford to graduating from the University of Oregon Medical Department and setting up her own practice in Portland.While in Oregon she joined the Oregon Equal Suffrage Association and fought for women\u2019s reproductive rights and workers\u2019 rights.\u201cYou completely see that that social justice leaning came from her experience in New Bedford,\u201d Saunders said.Elizabeth Piper Ensley was an African American suffragist who was born in New Bedford and became active in the suffrage movement when she was a professor at Howard University, according to local historian Lee Blake.Ensley later worked with the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) in Colorado, helped women secure the right to vote in the state in 1894, and founded the Colored Women\u2019s Republic Club to educate women of color on how to vote and why they should vote.Elizabeth Carter Brooks, the first African American woman to be hired as a public school teacher in New Bedford, was also active in organizing the vote for black people and black women, according to Blake.Women of color and white women didn\u2019t necessarily work together in the suffrage movement.\u201cThe white suffragettes really did not want to be working with black women because they were so paranoid that if they accepted black women white Southerners would not work with them,\u201d Blake said, \u201cThey did not want to antagonize the white Southern women.\u201dAccording to Blake, there were African American women who were in the forefront of the fight, but were standing alone.Though women have come a long way in the last hundred years, there are still gains that need to be made, according to Saunders.\u201cPart of what we need to gain is a sense of our own history,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cOur history has been hidden, not told, lost. So we\u2019re reclaiming our history by compiling and putting out these stories of women so that people understand what women have contributed to our communities and what women are capable of.\u201dIn addition to the art exhibition, Lighting the Way is partnering with YWCA to present Lighting the Way to Equality on April 18, a discussion with historian and author Melanie Gustafson about women\u2019s struggle for political inclusion.When asked why they wanted to participate, YWCA Director of Advocacy & Resource Development Jordan Pouliot Latham said, \u201cOf course we would.\u201d\u201cWe were always going to be talking about the anniversary of the 19th amendment and 2020 is such an important year with the census and the election,\u201d Latham said.Latham is also the co-director of the Womxn\u2019s Alliance, a group of over 40 organizations in New Bedford with the goal of creating a resource for women in the SouthCoast.The x in Womxn\u2019s Alliance\u2019s name is an intetional choice according to Latham, \u201cThe x in womxn is used to promote intersectionality, and to explicitly include femme, transgender women, and genderqueer and non-binary individuals.\u201d\u201cThis (alliance) has been happening for a while now, but to see it all coming together is pretty remarkable,\u201d Latham said. \u201dIt\u2019s led to some really amazing grant awards.\u201dThe Womxn\u2019s Alliance has developed a calendar featuring dozens of events related to women and feminist issues, including events related to the centennial of suffrage.The events, Latham said, will acknowledge that not all women were able to vote as a result of the 19th amendment and that voter purges and voter disenfranchisement are still happening to this day.Forms of voter suppression today include strict government issued ID laws, bans on criminals charged with felonies voting, counties with larger minority populations having fewer polling sites and poll workers per voter, and only 40% of polling places fully accommodating people with disabilities, according to Latham and statistics from the ACLU.Latham said she hopes that these events will build a coalition that intersects class, race, generation, residence and more \u201cto improve the lives of women and children in our community.\u201d\u201cIn order to build a more inclusive and robust community ,we have to have solidarity , and we're only going to do that if we do it through an intersectional approach,\u201d Latham said.The Women\u2019s Fund, which is a member of the Womxn\u2019s Alliance will also be commemorating the anniversary, according to Executive Director Joanne Murray.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have our 20th anniversary symposium in the fall and a key topic will be the acknowledgment of the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage and where we\u2019ve come and where we still need to go,\u201d Murray said.Women\u2019s lives have improved tremendously in the last 100 years, women have a lot more choices and there have been significant breakthroughs in surviving childbirth; and women are now part of medical protocols.But women are not in enough positions of power, Murray said, for example far too few women are on corporate executive boards, only making up 1 to 2% of board members.Murray also noted, \u201cEven though women have the same or slightly more levels of educational attainment as men, they don't have the same career progression as men.\u201dOne reason for that , according to Murray, is that we don\u2019t have an effective child care system.When asked what obstacles women still face, Latham discussed the gender pay gap\u00a0\u2014 especially as it breaks down by race and ethnicity, and women remaining largely underrepresented in political office .Murray wants young people to take up the mantle and continue the suffragists fight for women\u2019s rights.\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that young people have been leading the environmental movement,\u201d Murray said, \u201cI hope they will not have a sense of complacency about continuing to fight for women\u2019s rights.\u201dThat\u2019s why projects like Lighting the Way are important, Murray said. It\u2019s important to teach the historical significance of what these brave women did.The Zeiterion Performing Arts Center is also highlighting women\u2019s story, offering a special promotion on women-centric performances in honor of March as National Women\u2019s Month.\u201cWomen\u2019s stories are ripe for the performing arts. They're beautiful, complex, painful, hopeful, resilient, powerful stories that are meant for stage,\u201d Rosemary Gill, executive director of programming & development at the Zeiterion said, \u201cAs we see in our current climate, representation of women is still lacking in many areas. It is crucial for performing arts centers to showcase women and women\u2019s stories to raise awareness not just about their lives, but about their significance \u2014 past, present and future.\u201dTelling women\u2019s stories acknowledges their contributions to society, according to Saunders.\u201cI think the big idea that we want to make clear is whether or not women have had sanctioned power and authority, that women have made contributions and made a difference in multiple ways,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cAnd whether it's founding organizations that are key organizations in the community today, whether it\u2019s organizing community members to be volunteers, whether it\u2019s standing up and protesting conditions...women have claimed their own authority.\u201dView in new tabCareers Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices Staff DirectoryContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper Archives InstagramJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.southcoasttoday.com.
