Here are excerpts from a few of her important opinions.\n\u00a0\nSex Discrimination\n\u201c\u2018Inherent differences\u2019 between men and women, we have come to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual\u2019s opportunity. Sex classifications may be used to compensate women \u2018for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered,\u2019 But such classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.\u201d\nIn some ways, Ginsburg\u2019s entire career was preparation for her lead opinion in United States v. Virginia, a challenge to the male-only admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute. Her work as a litigator in two sex discrimination cases laid the groundwork for the court\u2019s 1996 decision that VMI\u2019s policy violated the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause. Virginia was unable to show the \u201cexceedingly persuasive justification\u201d required for its sex-based action, she said.\n\u201cA prime part of the history of our Constitution, historian Richard Morris recounted, is the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded. VMI\u2019s story continued as our comprehension of \u2018We the People\u2019 expanded. There is no reason to believe that the admission of women capable of all the activities required of VMI cadets would destroy the Institute rather than enhance its capacity to serve the \u2018more perfect Union.'\u201d\n\u00a0\nVoting Rights\n\u201cThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d\nGinsburg\u2019s dissent in this 2013 voting rights case, Shelby County, Ala. v. Holder, was one of her most forceful in her 27 years on the court. It reflected her deep sense of the nation\u2019s history with voting discrimination, her disagreement with Chief Justice John Roberts Jr.\u2019s statement that America has changed, and her respect for Congress\u2019 findings that the heart of the 1965 Voting Rights Act\u2014its requirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting laws in regions with the most serious histories of discrimination\u2014was still needed.\n\u00a0\nAbortion\n\u201cAs Casey comprehended, at stake in cases challenging abortion restrictions is a woman\u2019s \u2018control over her [own] destiny.\u2019 Their ability to realize their full potential, the Court recognized, is intimately connected to \u2018their ability to control their reproductive lives.\u2019 Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman\u2019s autonomy to determine her life\u2019s course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.\u201d\nIn public speeches and in abortion cases before the court, Ginsburg repeatedly emphasized what she believed was fundamentally at stake for women in challenges to the abortion right. Her comments in this quote came from her 2007 dissent in Gonzales v. Carhart in which a 5-4 majority upheld the federal \u201cPartial-Birth Abortion Act.\u201d The court, for the first time, approved a type of abortion ban that made no exceptions for the health of the woman.\n\u00a0\nFree Exercise of Religion\n\u201cThe exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would override significant interests of the corporations\u2019 employees and covered dependents. It would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers\u2019 beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure. In sum with respect to free exercise claims no less than free speech claims, \u2018your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man\u2019s nose begins.'\u201d\nThe end quote is not a Ginsburg original. She borrowed it from a 1919 Harvard Law Review article on free speech in wartime for another deeply felt dissent. In 2014, a 5-4 majority ruled in favor of the closely-held corporation, Hobby Lobby, whose owners challenged the inclusion of certain contraceptives in the women\u2019s health insurance component of the Affordable Care Act. The owners claimed providing such insurance coverage violated their religious beliefs and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hobby Lobby\u2019s argument for an exemption from the law meant that thousands of its women employees, many who may not share the owners\u2019 faith, would be harmed. The quote explains that our right to free speech, for example, does not extend to shouting fire in a crowded theater. There is a line where one person\u2019s right to speak or exercise religion ends where it infringes or harms another person.\n\u00a0\nSeparation of Church and State\n\u201cBy maintaining the Peace Cross on a public highway, the Commission elevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over nonreligion\u2026. As I see it, when a cross is displayed on public property, the government may be presumed to endorse its religious content. The venue is surely associated with the State; the symbol and its meaning are just as surely associated exclusively with Christianity.\u201d\nIn 2019, a 7-2 majority rejected the American Humanist Society\u2019s arguments that a 32-foot cross on public land violated the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition of the establishment of religion. Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote the dissent and the above comments. Ginsburg and Sotomayor often joined together in religion clause cases. They are the only justices of the nine who still adhere to the principle of a strong wall of separation of church and state. Now it\u2019s only Sotomayor.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 30: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, celebrating her 20th anniversary on the bench, is photographed in the West conference room at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Friday, August 30, 2013.
