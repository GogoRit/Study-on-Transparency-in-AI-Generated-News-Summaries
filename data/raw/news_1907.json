Close your eyes, she began, and picture someone you hold incredibly dear. \u201cNow imagine someone telling you you\u2019re going to lose that person in the very near future, but they can\u2019t tell you exactly when or how,\u201d she said. \u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s a very high likelihood that you\u2019ll get extremely sick, maybe even near death, as you wait for that person you love to die.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like a pretty sick and twisted plot to a dystopian novel,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. It\u2019s exactly what happened to me while pregnant in Texas.\u201d\nZurawski and her husband had known each other since preschool. They married in 2019 and were excited to start a family. After months of fertility treatments, Zurawski learned she was pregnant. The couple was beyond thrilled; they decided to name their daughter Willow. Zurawski was \u201ccruising though\u201d her second trimester, she said, and had just finished the invite list for her upcoming baby shower when everything changed. She developed \u201cunexpected and curious\u201d symptoms. Her obstetrician told her to come in right away. After an examination, the couple received the \u201charrowing news\u201d that Zurawski\u2019s cervix had dilated prematurely. Later her water broke; because Zurawski\u2019s pregnancy was still weeks from viability, there was no chance Willow would survive.\n\u201cI asked what could be done to ensure the respectful passing of our baby and \u2026 protect me from a deadly infection,\u201d she recalled. Nothing could be done, she was told, because of Texas\u2019s abortion bans.\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZurawski is one of five Texas women who are plaintiffs in a lawsuit that the Center for Reproductive Rights filed against the state this week. The lawsuit argues that the state\u2019s various abortion bans, which contain only vague exceptions in cases of medical emergency and impose both civil and criminal penalties if violated, have caused confusion and sparked fear among medical professionals, putting pregnant people\u2019s lives in danger.\n\u201cWhat the law is forcing physicians to do is to weigh \u2026 very real threats of criminal prosecution against the health and well-being of their patients,\u201d Nancy Northup, CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said during the Tuesday afternoon press conference. The lawsuit seeks to stop the \u201cunnecessary pain, suffering, injury, and life-threatening complications caused by Texas\u2019s abortion ban.\u201d\nThe lawsuit asks a state district judge to clarify the scope of the medical emergency exception and affirm that physicians can provide abortion care when an emergency condition arises. It is the first lawsuit of its kind, Northup said, \u201cin which individual women have sued a state for the harm that they endured because abortion care has been criminalized in the wake of Roe\u2019s reversal.\u201d\nZurawski\u2019s doctor said her pregnancy could not be terminated until there was no longer fetal cardiac activity or her health had deteriorated enough that the ethics board at the hospital would allow an abortion. \u201cI cannot adequately put into words the trauma and despair that comes with waiting to either lose your own life, your child\u2019s life, or both,\u201d she said. \u201cFor days I was locked in this bizarre and avoidable hell.\u201d Zurawski developed life-threatening sepsis; only then did the hospital agree that she was sick enough to qualify for abortion under Texas law. \u201cWhat I needed was \u2026 a standard medical procedure,\u201d she said. \u201cAn abortion would have prevented the unnecessary harm and suffering that I endured.\u201d\n\n\nNancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, speaks at the Texas Capitol on March 7, 2023, in Austin.\nPhoto: Rick Kern/Getty Images for the Center for Reproductive Rights\nConfusion and Intimidation\nBy the time the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization last June \u2014 which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated a half-century of constitutional protection for abortion \u2014 Texas politicians had already codified two abortion bans. During their 2021 biennial legislative session, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 8, a six-week ban that sidestepped constitutional oversight by outsourcing enforcement to vigilantes empowered to bring civil suits against health care providers or anyone else they believed might have aided a patient seeking an abortion in violation of the law. Lawmakers also passed a so-called trigger ban, a complete ban on abortion that took effect in August 2022, shortly after Roe\u2019s demise.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n            Read Our Complete Coverage          \nThe End of Roe\n\n\n\n\nTheoretically at least, each of the Texas bans has an exception for cases involving medical emergencies. But according to the new lawsuit, the laws don\u2019t use standard medical terminology, and what exactly counts as a medical emergency is vague. \u201cInconsistencies in the language of these provisions, the use of non-medical terminology, and sloppy legislative drafting have resulted in understandable confusion throughout the medical profession regarding the scope of the exception,\u201d the lawsuit reads. While the exception appears multiple times in the state\u2019s health and safety code, conflicting language leaves \u201cphysicians uncertain whether the treatment decisions they make in good faith, based on their medical judgment, will be respected or will later be disputed.\u201d\nAnd that is a serious problem given the extreme penalties for violating Texas\u2019s abortion bans. Doctors who violate the trigger law, for example, face revocation of their license, a civil penalty of at least $100,000 per violation, and, if criminally charged, up to 99 years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date, abortion is banned in 13 states, including Texas. Medical exceptions in those states vary, and some have none at all, providing only a list of possible defenses a physician can assert if they are prosecuted. Physicians have long warned that these exceptions are vague and place patients in danger. Stories of pregnant people denied abortion care despite suffering from serious medical complications or carrying a fetus with a fatal diagnosis have made news across the country, but they have prompted few, if any, attempts to better define exceptions to the bans.\nDuring his 2022 reelection campaign, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Inside Texas Politics that he\u2019d seen some situations in which pregnant people were not getting the heath care they needed to protect their lives. \u201cThere\u2019s been too many allegations that have been made about ways in which the lives of the mother are not being protected, and so that must be clarified.\u201d Although the Texas Legislature convened in January, no action has been taken to remedy the problem. A spokesperson for Attorney General Ken Paxton told the Associated Press that Paxton is \u201ccommitted to doing everything in his power\u201d to defend the laws as written.\nMeanwhile, anti-abortion groups have pushed back on the notion that the bans they advocated for need any clarification, suggesting that where patients like Zurawski are concerned, doctors are simply being negligent. That\u2019s exactly what the Texas Alliance for Life did in the wake of the center\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cTragically, some physicians are waiting until their patients are nearly dead before performing a life-saving medical procedure,\u201d Amy O\u2019Donnell, the group\u2019s communications director, said. \u201cWe see situations when pregnant women do not promptly receive treatment for life-threatening conditions as potential medical malpractice issues.\u201d\n\n\nPlaintiffs Anna Zargarian, Lauren Miller, Lauren Hall, and Amanda Zurawski at the Texas Capitol in Austin on March 7, 2023.\nPhoto: Rick Kern/Getty Images\n\u201cYou Need to Leave the State\u201d\nIn the face of legislative inaction, the new lawsuit seeks to have a judge step in and declare that doctors have the right to exercise their best medical judgment \u2014 and that they won\u2019t face penalties for doing so. It also argues that the Texas Constitution guarantees fundamental rights that don\u2019t disappear simply because a person is pregnant. \u201cTexas law cannot demand that a pregnant person sacrifice their life, their fertility, or their health for any reason, let alone in the service of \u2018unborn life,\u2019 particularly where a pregnancy will not or is unlikely to result in the birth of a living child with sustained life,\u201d it reads.\nThree additional plaintiffs in the center\u2019s lawsuit were also on the Capitol grounds Tuesday. Like Zurawski, they shared stories of wanted pregnancies that ended in heartbreak amid a nightmare of trying to access necessary abortion care in Texas.\nLauren Hall was nervous about becoming a parent, but excited, she told reporters. Then, when she was 18 weeks pregnant, an anatomy scan revealed anencephaly; her fetus was not growing a skull and had little brain matter. Her husband held back tears when he asked the doctor what they should do. The doctor hesitated. Wait to miscarry or leave Texas for an abortion, the couple was told. The doctor warned that if they chose to leave Texas, they should not tell anyone where they were going or why, and she couldn\u2019t refer Hall to an out-of-state provider or even transfer her medical records; under Senate Bill 8, no one knew how far Texas would go to prosecute people involved in abortion care. Hall and her husband made their way to Seattle, where she finally received the medical intervention she needed. Hall recalled protesters outside the clinic, \u201ccalling us killers and waving pictures with dead babies at us.\u201d\nLauren Miller already had a young son when she found out she was pregnant with twins. She and her husband were excited. They started calling the twins \u201cLos Dos,\u201d and every night, her husband would give her two kisses on the belly, \u201cone for each.\u201d But Miller began suffering from debilitating nausea and vomiting. At 12 weeks, she found out that one of the fetuses had two large fluid masses developing where his brain should be. The fetus had an often-fatal genetic abnormality, and later scans revealed \u201cone heartbreaking issue after another.\u201d Miller\u2019s medical providers seemed to be searching for words when trying to counsel her about her options, she said. Finally, one specialist tore off his gloves and threw them in the trash: \u201cI can\u2019t help you anymore,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cYou need to leave the state.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what she and her husband decided to do. She wanted to just \u201ccurl up and cry and mourn,\u201d but instead, she had to scramble to find care to give the other twin \u201cand myself the best chance of surviving this pregnancy.\u201d She and her husband felt lost, she said, \u201clike we were in a dark room feeling for a door.\u201d She noted that while she had the resources to access the care she needed out of state, others might not be as fortunate. \u201cLayers of privilege should never determine which Texans can get access to the health care they need.\u201d\n\u201cWhere else in medicine do we do nothing and just wait to see how sick a patient becomes before acting?\u201d\nAnna Zargarian was surprised to find out she was pregnant. It was September 2021, just after S.B. 8 had gone into effect, and she remembered \u201cnaively\u201d thinking that it was a good thing she wouldn\u2019t need an abortion. Two months later, Zargarian\u2019s water broke; her amniotic fluid was gone, and she was told the baby would not survive. On the Capitol lawn, Zargarian began to cry as she recalled getting the news. \u201cMy heart broke into a million pieces,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know a pain like that could exist until that moment.\u201d Under the provisions of S.B. 8, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get the care she needed in Texas until \u201cmy life was actively in danger,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u201d She fled to Colorado for care. \u201cWhere else in medicine do we do nothing and just wait to see how sick a patient becomes before acting?\u201d\nA reporter at the press conference asked how the women felt now, filing this case together after going through such an isolating ordeal. To be clear, Zurawski said, none of the women wanted to be there: \u201cWe have all become involuntary members of the most horrific club on the planet.\u201d And they were just a small representation of \u201ccountless others\u201d in Texas and around the U.S. who have gone through similar trauma. \u201cBeing together is powerful, but it\u2019s also traumatic knowing that there are so many people who are going through this,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re all here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jordan Smith          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      jordan.smith@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @chronic_jordan                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        As Texas Judge Stalls, the Abortion Rights Movement Won\u2019t Wait      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The Fight for Abortion Rights Turns to State Constitutions      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Supreme Court Ruling on Texas Abortion Law Opens Door to Copycat Schemes Everywhere      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Providers Sue to Block Law That Would Eliminate Nearly All Abortions in Texas      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
