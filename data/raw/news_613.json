The announcement resulted in mass demonstrations by Polish women whose right to choice has been stripped away by the government.\nThe ruling came from Poland\u2019s constitutional tribunal court in October and was greeted with protests across Poland and ire from pro-choice advocates around the world. The near-ban includes terminations of pregnancies with fetal defects. Abortions are only permitted in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his Instagram post, which was posted yesterday and removed while this article was being written, Nergal blasted the Polish government and the pervasive Catholicism that motivated the abortion ban:\n\u201cToday Polish government imposed a near-total ban on all abortions, including the termination of pregnancies with fetal defect. I\u2019m passionately enraged!! Becoz of this political discourse Poland has been on downward spiral to social oblivion for years now. We are moving back to the obscure, scary, medieval past.\nFrom now on my dear women, in the eyes of Polish political leaders you are just a breeding tool in their rigorous Catholic narration, u have NO control over your body whatsoever.\nThe consequences of choosing religious fundamentalists as your country\u2019s authorities: continuous limitations and censorship of main human liberties.\nWhat one can do? Well, the battle is lost\u2026 but the war is to be won by those enlightened, forward thinking.\n\u201cDo NOT cease your fight, spread the word, speak up and support Polish women in their relentless struggle! EXTERMINATE RELIGIOUS CANCER! F**k the system!\u201d\nAs an outspoken critic of religion and leader of an internationally known band, Nergal has gained the attention of the Polish government a few times, most famously for tearing up a Bible onstage in 2007.\n\n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\nBehemoth\u2019s Nergal to Musicians During Pandemic: \u201cYou Can Cry Like a Baby or \u2026 Do Something with the Situation\u201d\n\n\nBehemoth and Nergal also distanced themselves from the National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) movement that spread throughout Poland in the 1990s, symbolized by Nergal\u2019s exit from the Temple of Fullmoon cult after it became associated with intolerance and neo-Nazism.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad More\n\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nReddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArtists\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nBehemoth\nNergal\n\n\n\nMore on this topic\n\nAbortion\nBlack Metal\nPoland\nPolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our daily email digest for the latest headlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPopular Stories\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavy Consequence\nTool's Maynard James Keenan Helps Train Mike Tyson for Fight Against Jake Paul\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\nJeff Lynne's ELO Announce Farewell Tour\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nSign Up & Get $200 in Bonus Bets on Launch Day!\n\n \n\n\n\nTV\nThe Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live Delivers a Great Love Story at Last\n\n\n\n\n\nFilm\nRoad House Review: A Ripped Jake Gyllenhaal Doesn't Rip Any Throats In Solid B-Movie Remake\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas Extend 50th Anniversary Tour with Fall 2024 US Leg\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Day to Remember Announce 2024 North American Tour\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Who's Roger Daltrey Announces 2024 North American Solo Tour\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNandi Bushell Plays Incredible Rock Medley in Front of 20,000 People at O2 Arena: Watch\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool's Maynard James Keenan Helps Train Mike Tyson for Fight Against Jake Paul\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStone Temple Pilots and Live Announce Summer 2024 North American Co-Headlining Tour\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSebastian Bach Announces First Album in 10 Years, Unveils Single \"Everybody Bleeds\": Stream\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Knopfler Unites 54 of the Greatest Guitar Players for Epic Charity Song: Stream\n\nMarch 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nMusic\nNew Music\nAlbum Streams\nUpcoming Releases\nTours\nFilm\nTV\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nReviews\n\nMusic Reviews\nFilm Reviews\nTV Reviews\nConcert Reviews\nFestival Reviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nEditorials\nInterviews\nCover Stories\nLists\nGuides\nCoSign\nSong of the Week\n\n\n\nLive\n\nTickets\nFestival News\nTour Dates\nPhoto Galleries\nMusic Instruments & Gear\n\n\n\nHeavy\n\nNews\nInterviews\nConcerts\n\n\n\nMore\n\nPodcasts\nVideos\nWellness\nGiveaways\n\n\n\n\nOther sites\n\nHeavy Consequence\nConsequence Media\nModern Drummer\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nPrivacy policy\nAdvertising\nWork For Us\n\n\n\n\nTerms\nContact\nCopyright\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n\n\n\nDownload our app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\n\nPinterest\nTwitch\nTiktok\n \n\n\n\nConsequence\n\nCurrent story\nBehemoth's Nergal Slams Poland's Near-Total Ban on Abortions: \"We Are Moving Back to the ...
