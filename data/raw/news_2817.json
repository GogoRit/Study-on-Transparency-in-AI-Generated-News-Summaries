The timing of \u201cThe Problem\u201d and the fact that it\u2019s benefiting the Yellowhammer Fund are both important, as draconian, punitive abortion laws have been enacted in Alabama and neighboring states in the last year.\nLikewise, the changes underway to the Supreme Court after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg could also mean that abortion rights will come under fire nationally. On top of that, Shires notes, the \u201cpro-life\u201d stance doesn\u2019t typically extend past birth.\n\u201cThe South is in need of a lot of help,\u201d Shires tells Rolling Stone. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a big issue, as big of an issue as it is. Because once you have a baby, there\u2019s no social programming to help. It\u2019s all control.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening with solemn piano chords, \u201cThe Problem\u201d features Isbell\u2019s voice first, then Shires joins, and the pair trade lines as they move the story along. Shires\u2019 character wrestles with the decision and the right thing to do in her situation, while Isbell\u2019s character offers his support for whatever decision she makes. \u201cAnd all I could think to say/Was everything\u2019s going to be OK/It\u2019s gonna be all right/I\u2019m on your side,\u201d he sings.\n\n\u201cThe subject isn\u2019t talked about enough,\u201d Shires says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to make a tough decision, you need a lot of support. Wherever you get that support \u2014 whether in a relationship or friends \u2014\u00a0no matter what you believe, you can believe to support somebody through something hard.\u201d\n\u201cThe Problem\u201d wraps up by driving home the weight of the decision for her character. \u201cDo you think God still sees me, coming out of this twilight sleep?\u201d she asks, before the band carries the song out with a powerful extended coda.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much attached to folks thinking women treat it as a kind of birth control. People forget,\u201d Shires says. \u201cSome of the reason [\u201cThe Problem\u201d] is only coming out now is fear on my part, and I\u2019ll admit that. It\u2019s an often-times divisive topic, and I don\u2019t want to bring any hurt to my family by doing something like putting out a song about this topic, but I lost all that fear when I got angry. Then I\u2019m like, \u2018This is coming out now.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this article:\n\n\n\n\tAmanda Shires,\n\n\n\n\tJason Isbell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMusic\n\n\n\n\tMusic Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJelly Roll and Lainey Wilson to Perform at 2024 CMT Awards\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCMT Awards 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nJon Blistein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSufjan Stevens' Musical 'Illinoise' Will Open on Broadway in April\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMake Some Noise\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nLarisha Paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pretenders Plot Summer 2024 North American Tour\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nLarisha Paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSZA, Tyler, the Creator, and Blink-182 to Headline Lollapalooza 2024\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLolla 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nJon Blistein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBig & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Craig Morgan Lead New 2000s Country Cruise 'Boots on the Water'\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCome Aboard...\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\t\nJoseph Hudak \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRead more\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Latest\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJelly Roll and Lainey Wilson to Perform at 2024 CMT Awards\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCMT Awards 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t26 mins ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSufjan Stevens' Musical 'Illinoise' Will Open on Broadway in April\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMake Some Noise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t33 mins ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pretenders Plot Summer 2024 North American Tour\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOn the Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrump Throws Tantrum After Failing to Post Bond in NY Fraud Case\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tUnpaid \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe digital daily newsletter\t\t\n\t\n\n\nA Cultural Force ThatTranscends Generations \n\n\n\nEnter your Email\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSubscribe\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Go to PMC.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMost Popular\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBill Maher Fires CAA After Oscar Party Snub (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStephen Colbert Says CBS Asked Him Not to Show Kristen Stewart's Rolling Stone Cover; Stewart Says 'F--- You' to the Homophobic Haters\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRose Hanbury Just Broke Her Silence on the Prince William Affair Rumors\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKobe Bryant's Parents Face Backlash After Putting Championship Ring On The Auction Block\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tYou might also like\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tITV Ratings Champ \u2018Trigger Point,\u2019 Season 2, Rolled Out by All3Media International to Major Territories (EXCLUSIVE)\u00a0\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t4 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThree Key Takeaways From Ozempic and Zepbound Executives on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s \u2018Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution\u2019\u00a0Special\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t4 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Best Yoga Mats for Any Practice, According to Instructors\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t5 days ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSara Kiener\u2019s \u2018The Shawl\u2019 Ode to Stevie Nicks Is a Vimeo Staff Pick Premiere \u2014 Watch\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t3 hours ago\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJ.P.
