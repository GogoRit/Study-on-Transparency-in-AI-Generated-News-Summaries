Traditionally, society considers women dependent on men. Because of this historical reliance, women often find themselves in abusive or harmful relationships and the marriage of girls younger than the legal age often comes from necessity. As of 2019, cases of marriages of girls younger than 15 have risen to 5.4%, despite laws classifying the act as illegal. However, recent developments evidence that an increase in women\u2019s autonomy is possible in the Southern African country. This has come both in the form of laws and activist organizations taking steps to advance women\u2019s rights in Zimbabwe. Forward progress could help to ensure equality and protection for girls and women in the nation.\nNew Law Ensures Divorced Women a Fair Share of Property\nTraditionally in Zimbabwe, in marriage, property ownership rights are to the advantage of males and the law considers the husband the owner of the property. This secures a position wherein women are solely dependent on men and sole ownership of property by a female is rare. While men and women are just as likely to enter joint ownership deals, 22% of men are sole landowners compared to only 11% of women.\nThis could all begin to change after a decision by the Zimbabwe Supreme Court that entitles both partners to an equal share of their property upon divorce. Under this decision, women in Zimbabwe can now choose to divorce partners without the risk of giving up all possessions and property that is rightfully theirs.\nWomen in violent or abusive relationships now have more of a chance to move on and provide for themselves and their children after divorce. This large step in women\u2019s land rights will enable women to achieve independence, countering traditional beliefs in Zimbabwe.\nNo Expulsion for Pregnant Female Students\nIn the face of school closings during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Zimbabwean Government is trying to ensure all female students feel safe to return to school once educational facilities reopen. Many young women in Zimbabwe find themselves victims of sexual abuse, therefore, unexpected pregnancy is not uncommon. Often this will lead to women seeing no options other than early marriage and dropping out of school. In 2018, a study found that nearly 13% of school dropouts are linked to unexpected pregnancy or marriage. However, Zimbabwean schools often expel female students due to pregnancy.\nIn August 2020, Zimbabwe restrengthened an amendment stating that it is illegal to expel female students due to pregnancy. The amendment, introduced in 1999, does not have strong backing and many schools continue to punish pregnant female students rather than give them the further support they need.\nThis insurance to a proper education gives many women an option beyond economic dependence on an educated man, granting them the opportunity to become more self-reliant. It is also intended for the increased support of female students to reduce the dropout rate. This is a step in the right direction away from reliance on early marriage for the survival of many impoverished women in Zimbabwe.\n18+ and Roots Africa Work to Protect More Women\nSeveral organizations are working in the nation to advocate and work toward increased women\u2019s rights. One such group, 18+, focuses on lowering child marriage in the country as a whole. A study found that, in 2019, nearly 25% of young women entered marriages before the age of 18 years old. 18+ is using Zimbabwe\u2019s media to get its message across and is working to provide young women with information and resources on reproductive health and female empowerment.\nRoots Africa is another advocacy group working to advance women\u2019s rights in Zimbabwe. Seeing some success in lobbying for legal amendments in the past, the group currently has its sights set on the review of the Zimbabwean Termination of Pregnancy Act. This would allow more women access to safe abortions in Zimbabwe.\nCurrently, the only way to legally have an abortion is if the mother or child has a health risk or the mother can prove the pregnancy was a result of rape. Roots Africa also fights the normalcy of domestic abuse against women, supporting legislation such as the Domestic Violence Act in Zimbabwe.\nThe Future of Women\u2019s Rights in Zimbabwe\nThe work of women\u2019s rights groups in the country promises a better future for Zimbabwean women. Along with continued support from the Zimbabwean Government, this could mark a turning point for women\u2019s equality in the nation. Though it is currently too soon to note any effect of these new laws, if the country correctly enforces these laws, the nation could note a significant advancement in women\u2019s rights in Zimbabwe.\n\u2013 Matthew McKee\nPhoto: Flickr\nDecember 15, 2020Share this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on TumblrShare on VkShare on RedditShare by Mail\n\nhttps://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg\n0\n0\n\n\nYuki\n\nhttps://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/logo.jpg\n\nYuki2020-12-15 07:21:432022-04-06 05:33:57Strengthening Women\u2019s Rights in Zimbabwe\n\n\n\n\nGet SmarterGlobal Poverty 101\nGlobal Poverty\u2026 The Good News\nGlobal Poverty & U.S. Jobs\nGlobal Poverty and National Security\nInnovative Solutions to Poverty\nGlobal Poverty & Aid FAQ\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake ActionCall Congress\nEmail Congress\nDonate\n30 Ways to Help\nVolunteer Ops\nInternships\nThe Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cThe Borgen Project is an incredible nonprofit organization that is addressing poverty and hunger and working towards ending them.\u201d\n-The Huffington Post\n\n\n\n\nInside The Borgen ProjectContact\nAbout\nFinancials\nPresident\nBoard of Directors\nNewsletter\n\n\n\nGet SmarterGlobal Poverty 101\nGlobal Poverty\u2026 The Good News\nGlobal Poverty & U.S. Jobs\nGlobal Poverty and National Security\nInnovative Solutions to Poverty\nGlobal Poverty & Aid FAQ\u2019s\nWays to HelpCall Congress\nEmail Congress\nDonate\n30 Ways to Help\nVolunteer Ops\nInternships\nThe Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPledge for Women\u2019s Empowerment in Thailand\u00a0How Poverty Affects Everyday Life in Moldova\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
