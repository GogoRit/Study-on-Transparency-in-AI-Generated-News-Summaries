Birth rates have indeed been plummeting, though that is a longer-term trend.\nThe same poll also shows that the ban has caused a polarisation in views on abortion, encouraging a growing number to favour a more liberal law but also increasing the size of the small minority who want tougher rules that would bar terminations in cases of rape or if the pregnancy threatens a mother\u2019s life or health.\n\n\nOgraniczenie aborcji wp\u0142ywa na dzietno\u015b\u0107 [SONDA\u017b] https://t.co/Xbfz9L7ZmN\n\u2014 gazetaprawna.pl (@gazetaprawnapl) October 18, 2022\n\nThe poll \u2013 carried out by United Surveys for\u00a0Dziennik Gazeta Prawna and RMF24 \u2013 found that a narrow majority, 52% believe the new abortion rules, which went into force in January 2021, have made Poles less likely to have children. That was a rise from 45% when the same question was asked a year ago.\nAmong female respondents, the figure was 67%, up from 57% a year ago. For men, the figure stood at around 35% both this year and last year.\nOnly 7% of people think that the new law has made people more willing to have children (up from 3% last year), while 32% think it has had no effect (down from 42% last year).\n\nWoman dies in Poland after having to carry dead foetus for seven days\n\nOver the last year, there have been two high-profile cases in which women have died after complications with their pregnancies. Many blamed the tragedies on doctors\u2019 reluctance to provide abortions due to the strict new law.\nSince the near-total abortion ban was introduced, the number of births in Poland has fallen to historic lows. However, that is the continuation of a longer-term trend that began before the constitutional court ruling of October 2020 that led to the stricter abortion law.\n\n\nThe red line is deaths. The green line is live births. The blue lines are when the government introduced child benefit policies part of the rationale for which was to increase the fertility rate. https://t.co/DqnmZqNnnV\n\u2014 Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) September 24, 2022\n\nThe same United Surveys poll also found that a large majority, 76%, want to liberalise the abortion law, while only 19% want to keep the current near-total ban or make it even stricter.\nRespondents were asked if they want to: keep the current abortion law, which allows abortions only if pregnancies result from a criminal act or threaten the mother\u2019s life or health; return to the previous law, which also allowed foetuses to be terminated if defects were diagnosed; move to an even more liberal law; or toughen the current law.\nThe largest proportion, 44%, favour introducing a law even more liberal than the one before the current near-total ban (up from 36.5% last year). In practice, that would most likely mean allowing abortion on demand, something supported by the two largest opposition parties.\n\nOnly supporters of abortion on demand can stand as election candidates, say opposition leader Tusk\n\nAround one third (32%) want to return to the law that existed before the near-total ban was introduced (down from 43% last year). Those rules, introduced in the 1990s, were already among the toughest in Europe.\nOnly 12% would stick with the current rules (the same figure as last year) while 7% want a tougher law (up from 3% last year). Tightening the rules would in practice mean banning women from terminating pregnancies resulting from criminal acts and/or those that threaten the mother\u2019s life or health.\nThe new poll is one of a number in the last two years that have shown strong opposition to the near-total abortion ban and growing support for allowing abortion on demand.\n\n\nThe conservative majority in Poland\u2019s parliament has rejected a bill to liberalise the abortion law \u2013 one of the strictest in Europe \u2013 by allowing terminations on demand up to 12 weeks of pregnancy https://t.co/lMGTLFMcHI\n\u2014 Notes from Poland \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 (@notesfrompoland) June 23, 2022\n\nMain image credit: Maciej Wasilewski / Agencja Wyborcza.pl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel TillesDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0Notes from Poland.
