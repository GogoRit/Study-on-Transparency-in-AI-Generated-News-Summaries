That applies to Georgia's 2019 abortion bill, known as the LIFE Act, or the \"heartbeat bill,\" colloquially.McBurney's ruling took effect immediately statewide.\"At that time \u2013 the spring of 2019 \u2013 everywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments \u2013 federal, state, or local \u2013 to ban abortions before viability,\" McBurney wrote.The abortion bill\u00a0made abortion after six weeks a felony in most cases, even though such a law was clearly illegal and \"such bans were banned,\" according to McBurney. Therefore the law was invalid from the beginning and remained so even when the Supreme Court ruled such restrictions to be constitutional.\u00a0ABORTION RIGHTS WERE ON THE BALLOT IN THESE 5 STATES:\u00a0Here's what voters decided.Within hours, the office of the Attorney General in Georgia filed a brief notice of appeal, asking the Supreme Court of Georgia to review the ruling.\u00a0\u201cWe have filed a notice of appeal and will continue to fulfill our duty to defend the laws of our state in court,\" said Kara Richardson, spokesperson for Attorney General Chris Carr, in an email.The ban had been in effect since July after the Federal 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the abortion law \u2013 blocked under the federal court decisions at the time it was passed \u2013 could finally be put into law after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade.The law prohibited most abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d was present, effectually banning most abortions in Georgia before many people knew they were pregnant. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart around six weeks into a pregnancy.The ban included exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report was filed, and also allowed for abortions when the mother\u2019s life was at risk or if a medical condition rendered a fetus unviable.'THIS IS WHAT WE FEARED':\u00a0Latinas are largest group of women of color affected by abortion bansMcBurney\u2019s ruling follows the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, which represented doctors and advocacy groups, asking McBurney to strike down the law and a two-day trial held in October.Their lawsuit, filed in July, alleged that the ban violates the Georgia Constitution\u2019s right to privacy and liberty by forcing pregnancy and childbirth on women in the state.\u00a0While McBurney did not rule on that claim, his decision agreed with a different argument made in the lawsuit \u2014 that the ban was invalid because when it was signed into law in 2019, U.S. Supreme Court precedent under Roe. v. Wade and another ruling allowed abortion well past six weeks.\u201cToday\u2019s ruling recognizes that the legislature\u2019s decision to take away abortion access across our state was in clear violation of the law,\u201d Andrea Young, executive director of ACLU of Georgia, said in a news release. \u201cWe hope that the Georgia Supreme Court affirms that right, and in doing so affirms the long-standing Georgia rule that the legislature cannot pass laws that disregard our constitutional protections.\u201dThe Superior Court of Fulton County declined to issue an injunction on the law while the case was litigated. The ruling Tuesday, however, makes it clear that the parts of the law limiting abortion were illegal at the time they were passed and are therefore illegal still.\"If the courts have spoken, clearly and directly, as to what the law is, as to what is and is not constitutional, legislatures and legislators are not at liberty to pass laws contrary to such pronouncements,\" the decision reads.The ruling would not prevent the state legislature from passing a similar or even more restrictive ban under the new constitutional framework of Dobbs v. Jackson, the ruling earlier this year that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Still, the organizations that brought the suit celebrated the ruling as a win.COMPLAINTS AFTER MEDIA STORM:\u00a0Doctor who performed abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim sues Indiana AG\u201cAfter a long road, we are finally able to celebrate the end of an extreme abortion ban in our state,\u201d Monica Simpson, executive director of Sister Song, said in a news release. \u201cWhile we applaud the end of a ban steeped in white supremacy, it should not have existed in the first place.\"Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion organization, condemned the ruling.\"Shame on Judge McBurney for ignoring the will of the voters and imposing his own pro-abortion bias on Georgia instead,\" SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a news release.\u00a0The topic of abortion was a key issue in Georgia\u2019s U.S. Senate contest between Democr Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. Walker, who opposes abortion, was accused by two women in October of paying for them to have the procedure. He\u00a0denied both allegations.The race\u00a0is headed to a runoff in December.Contributing: The Associated PressFeatured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
