The last four years have been an assault on equality, health care and the civil rights of millions across the country -- an assault led by Donald Trump, Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell. We must Unite for Equality and hold them accountable this November at the ballot box.\u201d\nShould the ACA be eliminated, more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose their protections and guaranteed access to coverage, including those with employer-sponsored insurance who could once again face annual or lifetime limits on care. Tens of millions of people could lose coverage during a global pandemic as COVID-19 would qualify as a pre-existing condition.\nLast week, HRC responded to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Coney Barrett has demonstrated hostility toward LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, and her work and rulings have raised significant concerns to her approach to Civil Rights law. \nShe has criticized the ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act\u2014which has helped millions attain quality, affordable healthcare\u2014and expressed opinions that suggest she would strike down the law. Days after the election, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an argument in a case that could undermine this transformative piece of legislation, and with it the healthcare security of more than one hundred million people, including a disproportionate number of LGBTQ people.\nHRC published a research brief outlining the particular health and economic risks faced by the LGBTQ community during the COVID-19 public health crisis. Many in the LGBTQ community are uniquely vulnerable, as they are more likely to work jobs in highly affected industries, often with more exposure and/or higher economic sensitivity to the COVID-19 crisis, are less likely to have health coverage and are more likely to smoke and have chronic illnesses like asthma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nTo make a general inquiry, please visit our contact page.
