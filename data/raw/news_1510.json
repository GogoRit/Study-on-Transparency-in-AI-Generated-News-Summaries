(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPEKA \u2014 The GOP-dominated Legislature took aim Wednesday at Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s veto of three anti-abortion bills, ignoring objections about state-mandated misinformation, alienating OB-GYN workers and ignoring the will of voters.\nThe House and Senate completed a veto override of legislation requiring medical care for babies who are \u201cborn alive,\u201d which means House Bill 2313 will become law. The House also voted to override vetoes for two other laws that the Senate could consider Thursday.\nRepublican leaders have pursued anti-abortion legislation without regard for the 59-41 statewide vote in August 2022 to reject a constitutional amendment stripping women of the right to terminate a pregnancy.\nThe governor vetoed an assortment of anti-abortion bills passed by lawmakers before they adjourned earlier this month. They include House Bill 2325, which bans abortion providers from buying liability insurance from a state fund, and House Bill 2264, which requires physicians to give patients medically inaccurate information about the potential to reverse the abortion pill.\nRep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, said she was insulted by the name of the reversal bill, which is known as the \u201cWoman\u2019s Right to Know Act.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s what women really know: The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed bodily autonomy to women in Kansas, and this Legislature is trying to take it away,\u201d Ruiz said.\nThe \u201cborn alive\u201d bill requires medical care for infants extracted from the mother with a beating heart or ability to breathe, under the false pretense that \u201cfailed abortions\u201d are performed on infants that are capable of surviving. Kansas law bans abortion at 22 weeks from gestation, except to save the life of a mother.\nRep. Ron Bryce, a Republican physician from Coffeyville, said he personally provided aid to 27 babies who survived an abortion.\n\u201cWe are moral people,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cWe provide care for those who are weak, for those who are disadvantaged, for those who are innocent and powerless.\u201d\nA veto override requires the support of two-thirds of the members of both chambers. Those thresholds are 84 votes in the House and 27 in the Senate.\nThe House overrode the veto of the abortion pill reversal and liability insurance bills on 84-40 votes, and overrode the veto of the \u201cborn alive\u201d bill on an 87-37 vote. The Senate overrode the veto of the \u201cborn alive\u201d bill on a 31-9 vote.\nThe abortion pill reversal bill would require clinics, hospitals and pharmacies where the medication is prescribed or dispensed to post a conspicuous sign that is clearly visible to patients with lettering at least 3/4 of an inch in boldfaced type that says it may be possible to reverse the intended effects of mifepristone. Physicians also must provide information about the reversal before administering the abortion pill.\nMifepristone is used for about two-thirds of abortions in Kansas.\nResearch supporting the claim that the abortion pill can be reversed by taking a another drug has been debunked. Other research has shown reversal attempts to be hazardous to women\u2019s health.\n\u201cWhat I hear over and over and over and over from those of us who are not pro life, I hear, \u2018Trust women. Trust women,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Rep. Clarke Sanders, a Salina Republican. \u201cDo you really believe that? If you really believe \u2018trust women,\u2019 you\u2019re going to vote to override this veto. Women have a right to know this. They can make a decision about whether or not they want to try to change the decision they made initially about having a chemical abortion.\u201d\nThe third piece of legislation bans abortion providers from obtaining liability insurance through the Health Care Stabilization Fund, which all physicians are required to contribute to. However, the bill allows \u201cmaternity centers\u201d to have access to the fund.\n\u201cThese bills are going to drive providers out of our state, and we already have a problem in rural Kansas,\u201d said Rep. Melissa Oropeza, a Democrat from Kansas City. \u201cThis will continue to alienate new providers from coming into our state.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXKansas Legislature overrides governor\u2019s veto of anti-abortion bill\nby Sherman Smith, Kansas Reflector April 26, 2023\nKansas Legislature overrides governor\u2019s veto of anti-abortion bill\nby Sherman Smith, Kansas Reflector April 26, 2023\n TOPEKA \u2014 The GOP-dominated Legislature took aim Wednesday at Democratic Gov.
