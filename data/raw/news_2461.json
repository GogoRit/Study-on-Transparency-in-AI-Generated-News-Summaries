She was even Columbo\u2019s wife. But perhaps actress Kate Mulgrew is best known for playing Captain Kathryn Janeway on the long-running TV series Star Trek: Voyager. \nLONG AND STORIED\n\nKate Mulgrew has been around the block a time or two. Her career began in the mid-70s with an appearance on The Wide World of Mystery as well as the long-running soap opera Ryan\u2019s Hope. In fact, she was part of Ryan\u2019s Hope for 14 years.\nBefore, during, and after her Ryan\u2019s Hope years, Mulgrew spread her wings. She first became Mrs. Columbo, the wife of famous TV character Lieutenant Columbo (portrayed brilliantly by Peter Falk) from the TV series Columbo. Unable to grab fans the way the original series did, it lasted one season. \n\nThat cancellation didn\u2019t slow Mulgrew down. She continued to work both sides of the ledger, small and big screen. She grabbed roles in the TV series Cheers, St. Elsewhere, Man of the People, and Heartbeat while also starring in movies such as A Stranger is Watching, Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, and Camp Nowhere. All this was leading up to her most iconic role: the first female captain on a Star Trek series.\nTHE STAR TREK YEARS\n\nThe first three seasons of Star Trek: Voyager for Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway were good for the actress. It was a solid series, breaking barriers as Mulgrew took on a position within the Starfleet that no other female had before seen. But the ratings weren\u2019t jumping as much as those in charge were wanted. So, in season number four, Jeri Ryan came on board as Seven of Nine. The script flipped. So did Mulgrew. It didn\u2019t help Kate Mulgrew\u2019s cause when there was an immediate rise in the ratings.\nAccording to Voyager\u2019s executive producer Rick Berman, things were tense between the two women from the beginning. \u201cKate was sort of the Queen of Star Trek at that point. She hung out with astronauts, she hung out with Hillary Clinton, and she was the spokesman for women in leadership roles, and for a lot of things. All of a sudden, this busty, gorgeous, blond babe appears who took away everybody\u2019s breath. I literally once remember some press being on the stage and just sort of pushing by Kate to get to Jeri. So there was a little antagonism that existed right through to the end of the show with those two ladies.\u201d \n\nBerman wasn\u2019t the only one who saw this. Garret Wang, who played Operations Officer Harry Kim said, \u201cKate\u2019s anger was not directed toward Jeri Ryan, it was directed toward the character of Seven of Nine. She was the female captain, and now you bring in this borderline T-and-A character. When the writers/producers said no [about getting rid of her], she kept complaining. Finally her anger was turned toward the actress playing the character, Jeri Ryan. That\u2019s when it became horrible.\u201d \nHe also added this unbelievable anecdote. \u201cAt one point, Kate pulled the line producer aside and said, \u2018Jeri Ryan is not allowed to use the bathroom unless she uses it before work or after work, but not during work,\u201d another castmate added. \u201cIt takes too much time to get her in and out of that suit. It\u2019s wasting time.\u2019 Okay, so you\u2019re trying to tell another human being that they\u2019re not allowed to urinate? She\u2019s just got to hold it? Are you kidding me? Obviously it didn\u2019t happen; they didn\u2019t honor that request.\u201d\nJeri Ryan as Seven of Nine\nThere are quite a few more stories that fall in line with Wang\u2019s. Jeri Ryan even commented on the situation with Mulgrew: \u201cThe situation with Kate was very\u2026 difficult. It was not a fun work experience, particularly the first season. It was very difficult. I completely understand why. I get it, believe me, but it was very difficult. I had mornings, that first season especially, where I\u2019d be nauseous before I went to work that morning, because I was so stressed.\u201d\n\nRelated:\nStar Trek Creator Accidentally Reveals Borg Timeline Isn\u2019t What We Thought\n\n\nKATE MULGREW COMES CLEAN\n\nKate Mulgrew finally sat down with author Edward Goss to clear the air. He was in the process of writing The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years: From The Next Generation to J. J. Abrams: The Complete, Uncensored, and Unauthorized Oral History of Star Trek (yes, that\u2019s the title of the book!) and was hoping to get Mulgrew on the record concerning the horrible stories about her. \nHe got more than he bargained for in Mulgrew\u2019s own words, \u201cLet\u2019s be very straight about something,\u201d said Mulgrew to Goss via Closer Weekly. \u201cThis is on me, not Jeri. She came in and did what she was asked to do. No question about that, and she did it very well. It\u2019s on me, because I\u2019d hoped against hope that Janeway would be sufficient. That we didn\u2019t have to bring a beautiful, sexy girl in. That somehow the power of my command, the vicissitudes of my talent would be sufficient unto the day, because this would really change television, right? That\u2019s what dug me the hardest, that to pick up the numbers they did that\u2026 That was my interpretation of it. And that hurt me. I found it sort of insulting. And, of course, she embodied the part, this beautiful girl. But we certainly were utterly professional. I had been nothing short of completely professional, and she did her job. Very well! It was a very good idea that she was half Borg, but it\u2019s on me. I\u2019m sorry it has to be part of this legacy, and I probably should have comported myself better. I should have been more philosophical about it, but in the moment it was difficult.\u201d \nThat is a lot to swallow but very important in terms of Kate Mulgrew understanding her part in all that happened on Star Trek: Voyager.\nKATE MULGREW AFTER TREK\n\nKate Mulgrew\u2019s time as Captain Janeway ended in 2001. But even with Mulgrew\u2019s difficulties on the Voyager, her career did not stall. She moved on from series to series, movie to movie. She was seen in The Black Donnellys, Mercy, Warehouse 13, finally catching on to the hit series Orange is the New Black. \nKATE MULGREW NOW\n\nOrange is the New Black ended in 2019. Now 65-years-old, Kate Mulgrew is slowing down a little. These days she\u2019s doing voice work, voicing the part of Cat on Infinity Train. \nShe\u2019s also extremely active in the Star Trek fan community, doing various fan events and getting together with her old castmates. That includes Jeri Ryan who, it seems, bears Kate no ill-will for their contentious time together on Star Trek: Voyager. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B-NTE07J5hm/\n\nAs a lifelong, devout Catholic, Kate Mulgrew is also a staunch pro-life activist and also campaigns against capital punishment. She has received awards from the pro-life group Feminists for Life. Mulgrew says, \u201cLife is sacred to me on all levels\u201d.\nIn addition to her pro-life work, Kate is also a member of the National Advisory Committee of the\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s Association. Her mother died of Alzheimer\u2019s in 2006. \n\n\nRelated Topics:\n\nStar Trek\nKate Mulgrew\nColumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad More \n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n 16 And Pregnant Father Dead At 20\n4 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Natalie Portman Divorce Announced Amid Affair Allegations\n3 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Voyager 1 Worries NASA With Eerie Messages Sent To Earth\n5 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tom Hanks Heading Back Into World War II\n3 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1980s Sci-Fi Horror Comedy Cult Classic Restored For Incredible Release\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\n\n The Best Adam Sandler Movies Ranked From Good To Great, Including Spaceman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Denzel Washington\u2019s Best Movies Ranked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hello There: How Obi-Wan Turned A Greeting Into A Star Wars Meme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Best Will Smith Meme Following The Oscar Slap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Now\n\n\n\n\n Warner Bros.
