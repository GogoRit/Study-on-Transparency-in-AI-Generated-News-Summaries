He noted that the pin \u201cshows the size of an unborn baby\u2019s feet at 10 weeks of age\u201d and accompanied the announcement of her death with a picture of Evers placing a precious feet pin on him.Got news that Virginia Evers passed away last night at 99 yrs old.She was the inventor of the \"Precious Feet\" pin that #prolife people wear; it shows the size of an #unborn baby's feet at 10 weeks of age.Here, Virginia is placing on me one of those pins.May she rest in peace. pic.twitter.com/l0bND1sh6MGet Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post.

(Text LIFE to 88022) (@frfrankpavone) July 18, 2020 According to Live Action News, the precious feet pin \u201cwas inspired by a photograph that pro-life Dr. Russell Sacco took of the feet of a 10-week old aborted baby in the early 1970s when abortion was first legalized through Roe v. Wade.\u201d Sacco\u2019s photograph ended up being a full-page ad in a San Diego newspaper on Jan. 22, 1974, the first anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's\u00a0Roe v. Wade decision. After Evers and her husband, Ellis, saw the ad, she said, \u201cthese little feet would be the ideal pro-life symbol.\u201dNot long after Evers made that statement about the precious feet, she and her husband founded a ministry called Heritage House '76, based in Snowflake, Arizona. The ministry sells precious feet pins designed by Evers, which are \u201cthe exact size and shape of an unborn baby\u2019s feet at 10 weeks after conception.\u201d Heritage House \u201976 also sells a variety of other pro-life apparel including baby bottles, shirts, books, banners and magnets.In a fact sheet outlining the story of the precious feet, Evers said at the time: \u201cIn 1979, at a worldwide symposium in Dublin, Ireland, the \u2018precious feet\u2019 were named the \u2018international pro-life symbol.\u2019\u201d At the time of the fact sheet\u2019s publication, which was sometime around 1994, nearly 12 million precious feet pins had been distributed \u201cin 30 countries and six continents.\u201d\u201cThe greatest reward for our labor is the fact that the precious feet save babies lives,\u201d she added. \u201cA birthright volunteer visited a pregnant teenager contemplating abortion in a juvenile facility. The volunteer gave her literature and the precious feet pin from her lapel, explaining their significance (the girl was exactly 10 weeks pregnant). In the course of their conversation she learned that the girl\u2019s roommate was pregnant and definitely planning on an abortion. We were later informed by letter \u2018the precious feet pin did its work\u2014we were able to save not one but two babies.\u2019\u201dYears after the couple retired from Heritage House \u201976 in the early 1990s, their legacy lives on. Their daughter and son-in-law, Dinah and Mike Monahan, took over upon their parents\u2019 retirement. Mike Monahan later\u00a0died in an ATV accident in 2016, but by that time his son, Brandon, had taken on the leadership role at Heritage House \u201976.Over the years, national political figures have embraced the precious feet pin. In 2000, Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes adopted the precious feet as his campaign symbol. The Washington Post reported that a precious feet pin was one of many pins worn by then-Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Sheriff David Clarke as he gave a speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention.Was this article helpful?Yes2 VotesNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
