However, our criminal code makes no mention of this principle, and does not distinguish between \u2018direct\u2019 and \u2018indirect\u2019 termination: or any differences in the \u2018intention\u2019.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWhen medical doctors follow this principle in the management of cases when the mother\u2019s life or health is at risk, they are not in compliance with the law as it stands. That is why we believe that there should be a law that states that if the mother\u2019s life or health is in danger, then she should have the right to decide her own management, including the option of abortion.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\nAn unborn infant needs tender love, care and protection- Tony Mifsud\nTony Levatino,\u00a0a \u00a0prominent US obstetrician and gynaecologist, who turned from pro-choice to pro-life after performing thousands of abortions, gave\u00a0\u00a0the answer to Stabile\u2019s suggestion, above, at a US Judiciary Committee hearing on abortion on October 8, 2015. He said: \u201cI want to make a comment on the necessity and usefulness of utilising second and third trimester abortion to save women\u2019s lives. I often hear the argument late-term abortion is necessary to save women\u2019s lives in cases of life-threatening conditions that can and do arise in pregnancy.\n\u201cAlbany Medical Centre where I worked for over seven years is a tertiary referral centre that accepts patients with life-threatening conditions related to or caused by pregnancy.\n\u201cI personally treated hundreds of\u00a0women\u00a0with such conditions in my tenure there. There are several serious conditions that can arise or worsen typically during the late second or third trimester of pregnancy that require immediate care. In many of those cases, ending or \u2018terminating\u2019 the pregnancy, if you prefer, can be life -saving. But is abortion a viable treatment option in this setting? I maintain that it usually, if not always, is not.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cA patient arrived one night at 28 weeks gestation with a severe\u00a0medical condition.\u00a0Her blood pressure on admission was\u00a0very high. This patient\u2019s pregnancy was a threat to her life and the life of her unborn child. She could very well be minutes or hours away from a major stroke.\n\u201cThis case was managed successfully by rapidly stabilising the patient\u2019s blood pressure and \u2018terminating\u2019 her pregnancy by cesarean section. She and her baby did well. This is a typical case in the world of high-risk obstetrics. In most such cases, any attempt to perform an abortion \u2018to save the mother\u2019s life\u2019 would entail undue and dangerous delay in providing appropriate, truly life-saving care.\n\u201cDuring my time at Albany Medical Centre I managed hundreds of such cases by \u2018terminating\u2019 pregnancies to save mother\u2019s lives. In all those hundreds of cases, the number of unborn children that I had to deliberately kill was zero.\u201d\nToday many US gynaecologists are using\u00a0 \u2018the mould technique\u2019 to perform abortions, even until the very moment of birth.\u00a0They normally inject a\u00a0lethal dose of the heart medication Digoxin into the baby\u2019s heart,\u00a0or into the amniotic fluid,\u00a0directly through the woman\u2019s abdomen. Digoxin gives the baby a fatal heart attack. That\u2019s how to deliberately kill a person, however small.\nStabile declares that she feels obliged to work for \u201cchild health\u00a0issues, and most especially infant mortality\u201d. I don\u2019t think she is honouring her obligation in this respect when she is so actively advocating for a law allowing abortions in Malta. Abortion has only one meaning, the deliberate death of an infant so small, voiceless and helpless in his mother\u2019s womb.\nAn unborn infant needs tender love, care and protection.\u00a0 He or she should be given all the opportunities to thrive and develop in the womb to eventually be born, mature into an adult \u00a0and be a respectable and responsible Maltese citizen.\nTony Mifsud, coordinator, Malta Unborn Child Platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up to our free newsletters\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\nGet the best updates straight to your inbox:\n\n\n\nDaily newsletter (the day\u2019s top headlines, sent every\nmorning)\n\n\n\nFrom the editors (a curated selection of stories, sent\nevery Saturday)\n\n\nPlease select at least one mailing list.\n\nYou can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.
