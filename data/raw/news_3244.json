Jodey Arrington holds pro-life roundtable, details next steps for movementLubbock congressman plans to introduce federal abortion ban Alex DriggarsLubbock Avalanche-JournalU.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Lubbock, held a roundtable discussion and news conference Thursday afternoon with Lubbock pro-life advocates celebrating the overturning of Roe v. Wade and detailing his next steps following the ruling \u2014 including plans to introduce legislation to ban abortion outright at the federal level.The group included representatives from Project Destiny and Citizens for Education Reform, among others.\u201cWhat I wanted to do, after screaming hallelujah and thanking God for this new decision and for restoring the constitutional integrity at the Supreme Court and restoring power back to the states and people with regards to abortion policy, I wanted to come home and thank the great efforts of pro-life organizations who have been working on this for decades,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cI think when it comes to a pro-life community and grassroots activists who want to have a country that the sacredness of life and have a culture of life, West Texas is ground zero.\u201d\u2018My body, my choice\u2019: Lubbock activists protest abortion ruling after Roe v Wade overturnedArrington said the focus now is on supporting expecting mothers who may be facing an unplanned pregnancy. He explained that nonprofit organizations and elected officials alike have a responsibility to help meet families\u2019 needs in a post-Roe society.\u201cThis would be a squandered opportunity if we weren\u2019t prepared as a community \u2026 to meet the needs downstream now that we\u2019re going to celebrate and welcome more lives into our community, our state and our country,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cThere are needs \u2014 needs for the pregnant moms, needs for the children, for adoption, foster care, healthcare, mental health, spiritual needs \u2014 and so I\u2019m encouraged to hear that this community of pro-life advocates are not just pro-life at conception, or pro-life through the pregnancy, but they are pro-life every step of the way downstream, for the mom, and for the child.\u201d\u201cAll of this is done with a motivation of compassion, not condemnation,\u201d Arrington added.More:Lubbock politicians praise Roe v. Wade ruling, while Planned Parenthood condemns itIn Washington, Arrington said, the next step is passing a nationwide ban on abortion \u2014 legislation that he\u2019s already drafting in anticipation of a more conservative Congress after the November mid-term elections.\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce (a federal ban on abortion). I\u2019m working on it right now, to take the State of Texas law, which basically prohibits abortion except in the situation where the mother\u2019s life is at risk \u2026 I\u2019d like to have that the law of the land,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cBut I also understand, respect and support the decision the Supreme Court made, which is, until such time there is legislation that passes the legislative body at the federal level, then we delegate it to the states.\u201dProject Destiny says their next steps are to \u201cunify, awaken, educate and challenge\u201d pro-life organizations and churches to come alongside the group to support their cause and mothers and children.Arrington echoed that call.\u201cEven though you think your voice doesn\u2019t matter, it matters,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cStep up, get with a group like (Project Destiny) locally, and you can make a difference.\u201dCareers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.lubbockonline.com.
