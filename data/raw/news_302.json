The Due Date Too Late campaign spearheaded the charge to gather signatures with support from Catholic Charities\u2019 Respect Life Office and other pro-life communities across the state.\n\u201cI am overjoyed to hear that so many Coloradans have signed the petition to successfully place Initiative 120 on the November ballot,\u201d said Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila, who expressed his support for the initiative early on. \u201cProtecting children in the womb is an essential part of building a society that treats all life, no matter its age or ability, as sacred. God has given each person a dignity that comes from being made in his image and likeness, and the degree to which our laws reflect that will be the degree to which we experience true freedom and happiness.\u201d\nInitiative 120 would prohibit abortion in Colorado after 22 weeks, with an exception for the life of the mother. According to a recent Gallup poll, 74% of Americans believe that there should be limitations on late term abortion. Due Date Too Late submitted the bulk of the needed petition signatures in March but fell short 10,000 signatures after review by the Secretary of State. The cure period began on May 15, with Due Date Too Late needing to collect those 10,000 additional verified signatures of registered Colorado voters during the 15-day cure period to meet the 124,632 threshold and qualify for the November ballot.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to take this next step towards protecting lives in Colorado by exceeding our goal of signatures we are turning into the Secretary of State,\u201d said Lauren Castillo, spokesperson for the Due Date Too Late campaign. \u201cWe are thankful to have this opportunity to work together with communities across the entire state of Colorado. The hundreds of volunteers we have who are so passionate about ending late-term abortion are helping to make this a reality.\u201d\nDue Date Too Late will be turning in the notarized packets containing almost 50,000 signatures on May 29 at 2 p.m. to the office of the Secretary of State to assure that the ballot initiative will meet the statutory threshold.\nThe field collection effort by Due Date Too Late went forward amid a recent executive order by Gov. Jared Polis regarding how petition signatures may be collected. Under Gov. Polis\u2019 order, he declared that ballot initiatives could gather signatures electronically in response to the coronavirus pandemic; however, Initiative 120 was the only ballot initiative that wasn\u2019t allowed to collect signatures electronically because it was in a cure period.- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: An earlier version of this story stated over 30,000 signatures were being turned in, based on the information that was available at the time of publication. The actual number is closer to 50,000. The story has been updated to reflect this fact.\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinPinterestEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n\n\n\nPrevious articleOfficial Appointments, May 8, 2020: Permanent DeaconsNext articleStatement of U.S. bishop chairmen in wake of death of George Floyd and national protests\n\nAaron LambertAaron is the Managing Editor for the Denver Catholic.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\nFeast Days  \n\nBake St. Joseph\u2019s Bread for the Solemnity\n\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nNew recreation center for St. John Vianney seminarians breaks ground\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nPHOTOS | St. John Vianney Seminary celebrates 25 years with special Mass\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n \n\nPrepare your hearts for Easter joy at a Lenten Penance Service\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhy get married in a church?\n\n\nMarch 11, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day: History, spirituality and traditions\n\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nFacebookInstagramTwitter\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nLea nuestra publicaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol \n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLent\nOne Less Thorn for Every Act of Charity: A Beautiful Lenten Tradition to Embrace with Your Children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAround the Archdiocese\nNew recreation center for St. John Vianney seminarians breaks ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAround the Archdiocese\nQ&A: Inaugural March for Life Colorado happening April 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCatholic News Agency\nHarrison Butker Addresses Family Life, Gun Violence, Taylor Swift and More in Far-Reaching Interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGeorge Weigel\nThe good news is that the bad news isn\u2019t all the news there is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Catholic Faith\nAll Saints\u2019 Day not a Holy Day of Obligation in 2021, but go to Mass anyways!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSaints\nWhy is devotion to Mary important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFeatures\nOur Lady Of Guadalupe: The miracle that changed history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEucharist\nThe Eucharist throughout history: A timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJared Staudt\nArs Moriendi: The art of dying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\nContact\nPast Issues\nEvents\nAdvertising\nObituaries\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1999-2023 Archdiocese of Denver.
