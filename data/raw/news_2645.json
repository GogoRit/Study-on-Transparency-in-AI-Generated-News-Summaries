On Friday evening, as tens of thousands of pro-choice protesters gathered in Warsaw for a massive demonstration against a near-total ban on abortion, military police in red berets formed a protective cordon around the Church of the Holy Cross on Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie, an elegant thoroughfare leading from Warsaw\u2019s Old Town to the city centre.Behind the military cordon stood far-right activists and supporters of Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), responding to a call by PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski to \u201cdefend Polish churches\u201d from what government-controlled state television news describes as the \u201cleftist fascism destroying Poland\u201d after some churches were defaced during protests last weekend.As the pro-choice protesters filed past the church, government supporters chanting mournful incantations blasted the screams of a crying baby through giant megaphones at the entrance to the church. The sound was broadcast on a loop, the desperate screams repeated over and over as protesters marched stoically past.Poland's abortion ban is a cynical attempt to exploit religion by a failing leader | Karolina WiguraRead moreAgata and Aleksandra, both doctors from Warsaw who declined to give their surnames for fear of repercussions, were among those marching past the church and doing their best to ignore the screams. Standing under a statue of the 16th-century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, they described their intense anger at a system that does so little to support the parents of disabled children and yet appears intent on banning terminations even in instances where a foetus is diagnosed with a serious and irreversible birth defect.\u201cThe moment when a woman discovers that the baby is sick and will probably die just after birth, this is the worst moment of their life,\u201d said Agata, a gynaecologist, who was carrying a placard reading, \u201cDon\u2019t make me torture my patients\u201d.\u201cUsually these are older women in their 30s, women who really want this child, and the news leaves them completely destroyed. Until now they had a choice about whether to wait, give birth, and watch the child die \u2013 but they will not have that choice any more. As a doctor I want to help them, but now if I help them I would be going against the law.\u201dView image in fullscreenHuge pro-choice crowds converge on central Warsaw on Friday night to protest against the country\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty ImagesBut if the protests, which by Friday had entered their ninth day, have been characterised by anger at Poland\u2019s political and clerical establishments, the rage felt by many marching through the streets manifested itself within a joyful, even carnival atmosphere.Accompanying the chants of \u201cFuck PiS!\u201d and \u201cThis is war!\u201d were thousands of humorous placards mocking Polish leaders and demanding the right to choose. Some protesters wore costumes and danced as techno music and 80s classics were blasted from speaker vans. Protesters brought drums, vuvuzelas, kitchen pots and pans \u2013 even bagpipes.When you are dealing with louts and bumpkins you have to adapt and use language that they actually understandAlicja, pro-choice protesterThere was a sense of euphoria as the various columns of the protest converged in central Warsaw into a single demonstration of 100,000 people, defying coronavirus restrictions banning gatherings of more than five. As they chanted, the red lightning bolt symbol of the Polish Women\u2019s Strike was projected on to the giant communist-era Palace of Science and Culture as police helicopters circled.Not even the nationalist football hooligans who attacked the crowd on several occasions were able to spoil the mood of the protesters.In one incident witnessed by the Observer on the central thoroughfare of Jerusalem Avenue, about a dozen men dressed in black appeared from a side street and attacked the rear of a column of protesters, appearing to beat up one man quite severely. They were confronted by protesters with what appeared to be some kind of pepper spray or tear gas, leaving several bystanders spluttering and gasping for air.The Polish police later confirmed that several such incidents had occurred; of the 37 people arrested on Friday, 35 were associated with nationalist circles. Police also confiscated an array of weapons, including batons and knives.Many observers blame Kaczy\u0144ski, Poland\u2019s de facto ruler, for encouraging the violence by calling on his supporters to defend churches even after far-right groups had announced their intention to create vigilante patrols to confront the protesters. Last weekend, a woman was treated in hospital after allegedly being thrown down the steps of the Holy Cross Church during clashes between pro-choice demonstrators and nationalist activists.View image in fullscreenThe red lightning bolt, a motif of the Warsaw protests, is a symbol of women\u2019s activism in Poland. The placard reads: \u2018What the hell have you done\u2019. Photograph: Kacper Pempel/ReutersMuch has been made in the pro-government media of the apparent \u201cvulgarity\u201d of the protests, with demostraters regularly chanting \u201cWypierdalaj\u201d, or \u201cFuck off\u201d and holding placards with messages such as \u201cMy pussy, my swamp\u201d, and \u201cKaczy\u0144ski [a bachelor] is fucking us because he hasn\u2019t got anyone else\u201d.But protesters argue that their language is a natural response to the contempt shown towards them by their government since it assumed office in 2015.\u201cOur attitude has changed in recent years because we realised that when you are dealing with louts and bumpkins you have to adapt and use language that they actually understand\u201d, said Alicja, an IT worker who was holding a sign reading, \u201cI tried being nice, now I\u2019m just fucking pissed off.\u201dAnd several commentators have argued that the protesters\u2019 anger goes far beyond the present government and the issue of abortion, extending to the indignities of living in what is still a patriarchal society and under a political and legal order that was shaped in the 1990s by a previous generation of socially conservative men from both sides of the country\u2019s political divide.Last week, Tomasz Grodzki, the opposition speaker of the senate, in a clumsy attempt to express his support for the protests, declared: \u201cIt is women who ensure that our daily lives go harmoniously and smoothly in an almost unnoticeable way.\u201d\u2018These codgers seem to think that the [protesters\u2019 chants of] \u2018Fuck off\u2019 only concern politicians from PiS,\u201d wrote commentator Kaja Puto in response. \u201cWomen have taken to the streets to fight for their rights, not so that you can return to power \u2026 For the last 30 years, as you have repeated the same conservative rubbish, Polish women have changed.\u201dExplore more on these topicsPolandThe ObserverAbortionWomenHealthEuropeThe far rightProtestfeaturesShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyPolish activists protest after woman\u2019s death in wake of strict abortion law2 Nov 2021Poland activists urge people to think before ticking Catholic box in census19 Apr 2021Poland accused of abandoning domestic violence victims7 Apr 2021Third night of protests in Poland after abortion ban takes effect29 Jan 2021Poland abortion ban sets stage for Women's Strike showdown28 Jan 2021Poland to implement near-total ban on abortion imminently27 Jan 2021Polish women travel abroad for abortions ahead of law change13 Dec 2020'A backlash against a patriarchal culture': How Polish protests go beyond abortion rights6 Nov 2020Poland delays abortion ban as nationwide protests continue3 Nov 2020Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
