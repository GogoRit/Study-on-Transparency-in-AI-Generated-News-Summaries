This comes shortly after her rapper, entrepreneur and fashion mogul ex broke down in tears as he recalled wanting now-wife Kim Kardashian to abort their eldest child North, seven.  Kanye cried \"I nearly killed my daughter!\" at his tearful presidential campaign launch in South Carolina. While clarifying that he wasn't opposed to abortion, Kanye's claims about Kim's early pregnancy are said to have left her family \"shocked beyond words.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmber shared a powerful women's rights message\n (\n\nImage:\nInstagram)\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriana Grande 'sparks \u00a34 million bidding war' for rights to Sweetener tour film\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKanye West picks biblical life coach Michelle Tidball as 2020 running mate\n\n   Now Amber - real name Amber Levonchuck - has made her position on the topic crystal clear, taking to Instagram and penning: \"Women get shamed for sex.  \"For liking sex. For not liking sex. For having kids. For not having kids. \"For aborting cells that might turn into kids. For having kids too young. For having kids too old. \"Just stfu man.\" Model Amber added: \"Please stop telling women what to do with our bodies #slutwalk2021.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmber and Kanye dated between 2008 and 2010\n (\n\nImage:\nSplash)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKanye wept as he recalled wanting Kim to get an abortion\n (\n\nImage:\nREUTERS)\n\n \"I want to tattoo this on my face,\" one fan gushed about Amber's words. \"Say it louder for the misogynists in the back,\" another chimed in. Amber tied the knot with rapper Wiz Khalifa in 2013, but announced they were going their separate ways the year after. Kanye's campaign launch also saw him claim his father had wanted his mother to abort him. The Wash Us In The Blood rapper jetted out to his ranch in Cody, Wyoming following a string of now-deleted tweets that made a number of claims. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKanye touched on a range of topics - including abortion\n (\n\nImage:\nREUTERS)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKanye apologised to Kim, while Kim urged compassion for Kanye and his mental health\n (\n\nImage:\nGetty Images for Sean Combs)\n\n In one, he suggested that Kim had been unfaithful in 2018 with rapper Meek Mill, something the latter dismissed as \"lies.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  He also insisted he'd been looking to get a divorce from Kim, branded his wife and mother-in-law Kris \"white supremacists\" and compared Kris to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Kanye has since publicly apologised to Kim and asked her forgiveness, while Kim issued a statement urging compassion and awareness of mental health issues following his reported bipolar episode.  Last week, Kanye made his Twitter return after nearly a week away from the site, insisting he's \"quite alright\" but admitting he's \"concerned\" for the world following the reaction to his teary-eyed abortion rant.
