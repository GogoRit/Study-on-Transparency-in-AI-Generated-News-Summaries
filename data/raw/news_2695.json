His Response to COVID-19 Proves It.6 minute readIdeasBy David FrenchOctober 6, 2020 4:08 PM EDTFrench is a senior editor at The Dispatch and a columnist for Time. His new book is Divided We Fall: America's Secession Threat and How to Restore Our Nation. He is a former major in the United States Army Reserve.As Americans have begun to vote in the presidential election, one must make an important distinction in Donald Trump\u2019s record in office. It\u2019s entirely fair to call him nominally anti-abortion. It\u2019s not credible to call him pro-life. And the distinction matters.As a young pro-life activist, I still remember the publication of Pope John Paul II\u2019s Evangelium Vitae, its words touched this Protestant\u2019s heart, and when he rooted the pro-life principle in the \u201cincomparable worth of the human person,\u201d it crystalized not just my opposition to abortion but also an aspirational ethic of care for all persons \u2013 from conception to natural death.\u201cLife on earth,\u201d said John Paul, \u201cis a sacred reality entrusted to us, to be preserved with a sense of responsibility and brought to perfection in love and in the gift of ourselves to God and to our brothers and sisters.\u201dTo be sure, it is often difficult to discern which policies are best-crafted to uphold and protect every person\u2019s \u201cincomparable worth\u201d \u2013 and even well-intentioned policies can have negative effects \u2013 but it is abundantly clear that while pro-life leaders will often be forced to make tough choices, their words and deeds must be grounded in that fundamental truth.Trump has failed this test, and his response to the Coronavirus pandemic makes that failure plain. He\u2019s not only failed the American people, his recent conduct after he was stricken with the disease demonstrates that he has even failed his friends, colleagues and those sworn to serve him.It\u2019s a testament to the speed of the news cycle and the sheer number of Trump scandals that the public has apparently moved on from Bob Woodward\u2019s revelation that Trump knew the virus was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d and \u201cworse than even your strenuous flus\u201d in early February yet continued to intentionally downplay its severity to the American people, including by comparing it to the flu, as he\u2019s still doing today.This deception was of course accompanied by an avalanche of right-wing mockery of and resistance to mask-wearing, including mockery from Trump himself. At the first presidential debate (when Trump may have already been COVID-positive), Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t have \u2014 I don\u2019t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he\u2019s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from them and he shows up with the biggest mask I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThe administration\u2019s disregard of basic health protocols, including both masking and social distancing was on full display at the White House ceremony introducing Amy Coney Barrett to the American people. For a nation now accustomed to prudent masking and limiting close personal contact (especially indoors), the images were shocking. Unmasked leaders, including people with potential health vulnerabilities, were hugging and close-talking. And now the roll call of attendees who have tested positive for Coronavirus is shocking and long.Compounding the deception and disregard, what did President Trump do after he was released from the hospital? He once again compared the virus to the flu \u2013 misinformation so obvious that Twitter immediately flagged it as \u201cpotentially harmful\u201d and Facebook removed the post.By deceiving Americans he left millions in denial about the spread of a deadly virus, and they behaved accordingly. By scorning mask-wearing, he helped create a ridiculous mask culture war that renders it politically incorrect in parts of the right to engage in one of the easiest and most basic practices to protect the health of your neighbors and colleagues.One is flatly denying the \u201cincomparable worth of the human person\u201d when they fail to follow basic, common-sense masking guidelines. One is instead indulging in a form of petty selfishness that has cost an untold number of lives.The pandemic would be challenging under any circumstances, but the United States has so far recorded one of the worst responses of any advanced democracy in the world. A terrible total of over 210,000 Americans have died, and hundreds more die every day. Excess death data indicates the true toll is likely much higher.By any measure, the Coronavirus pandemic has been a public health catastrophe. Yet the president and his team still downplay its severity. They still mock Joe Biden\u2019s mask-wearing.Nothing about this is pro-life. Nothing.Yet there are Americans who will go to the polls convinced that Trump is the only pro-life candidate \u2013 exclusively based on his professed opposition to abortion. But how committed is Donald Trump to restricting abortion, really? If you look at his record across his time in office it is revealing. For instance, Planned Parenthood received a record amount of taxpayer funds in 2019, and this year received $80 million in federal coronavirus relief funds. Or take the fact that the two Supreme Court justices he nominated and confirmed (so far) did vote to uphold a mild Louisiana abortion restriction, but they notably did not join Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion that clearly condemned Roe.We know what it looks like when Trump is committed to a cause. Witness his deployment of the military to the border and his defiant diversion of military funds to begin construction of his border wall. Has he showed the same commitment to, say, ending taxpayer support for the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider?The bottom line is that Trump will end his first term with the nation\u2019s abortion laws largely intact and without engaging in a single serious effort to defund Planned Parenthood. He will also end his first term with a legacy of deception, failure, and callous disregard for the lives and health of even his friends and colleagues in the face of an infectious disease that has killed more than 200,000 of his fellow citizens.Look at Donald Trump\u2019s complete record. Examine all his rhetoric. Is his presidency characterized by words and deeds that affirm the \u201cincomparable worth of the human person\u201d? Has he treated \u201clife on earth\u201d as a \u201csacred reality\u201d entrusted to him? The answer is clearly no. His selfish and reckless actions have cost lives. They\u2019re still costing lives. By no fair measure is Donald Trump truly \u201cpro-life.\u201dMore Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
