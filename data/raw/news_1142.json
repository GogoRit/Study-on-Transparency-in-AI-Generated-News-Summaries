But rather than focusing on abortion itself, the suits argue that the law is unconstitutional in other ways \u2014 violating the right to due process, free speech and equal protection under the law.\nTexas\u2019 abortion law, passed last year as Senate Bill 8, empowers private citizens to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law is extremely broad \u2014 anyone, regardless of where they live or whether they have a connection to the person obtaining an abortion, can bring a lawsuit against anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion in virtually any way.\nIt\u2019s specifically written to evade judicial review, which has allowed it to remain in effect for more than six months. But the Texas Equal Access Fund and the Lilith Fund, which help patients pay for abortions and related expenses, believe this new angle may be the key to undoing the law.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that any judge who looks at this will recognize the civil enforcement mechanism for what it is \u2026 and say these cases aren\u2019t really about abortion,\u201d said Elizabeth Myers, an attorney representing the abortion funds.\nInstead, she said, their legal challenge is about stopping the \u201cmillions of bounty hunters who can sue in a very rigged one-sided court system\u201d under the law\u2019s private enforcement mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspects of this argument have already succeeded in state court, where a Texas judge found the law to be unconstitutional but declined to block it from being enforced. Now, the same lawyers are taking the case to federal court, where challenges to the law have faltered before.\nBut this attempt will have an advantage that those did not: The federal suits are filed in Chicago and Washington, D.C., rather than Texas, which allows the plaintiffs to avoid the extremely conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe other two suits are filed in state court and have been added to ongoing multidistrict litigation, where all legal proceedings are stayed while the case is appealed.\nSouth Texas College of Law Houston professor Rocky Rhodes said there are potential obstacles to this approach in federal court, but it\u2019s the \u201cbest bet\u201d to block the law that he\u2019s seen yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a better procedural mechanism to get the case before the [U.S.] Supreme Court \u2026 and it addresses many of the issues from the previous challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, of course, a Supreme Court ruling is binding on all state and federal courts.\u201d\nThis case will be watched closely, not just in Texas, but across the country. Other states, including Idaho and Oklahoma, have taken steps to pass similar laws creating private enforcement abortion bans.\nAbortion funds in the crosshairs\nWhen Texas\u2019 law went into effect in September, clinics stopped performing abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, fearing lawsuits.\nWhile the clinics have necessarily scaled back services, abortion funds have stepped forward to fill in the gaps \u2014 providing funds, material support and guidance to help women travel out of state to obtain abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has put them in the crosshairs of anti-abortion groups, including the Thomas More Society and the America First Legal Foundation.\nLast month, these anti-abortion groups asked a judge to allow them to depose the leaders of two abortion funds, the Texas Equal Access Fund and the Lilith Fund, to discover the \u201cextent of involvement of each individual that aided or abetted post-heartbeat abortions in violation of SB 8.\u201d\nA judge has not yet ruled on that petition. But it created an opportunity that the abortion funds have been waiting for \u2014 an opening to challenge the law by suing someone who intends to enforce it.\nThis was the hurdle in the previous federal legal challenge: While lawyers representing the abortion providers identified a slew of state actors they believed were responsible for enforcing the law, the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with most of them. Recently, the Texas Supreme Court threw out the last remaining argument in that case, leaving them no one to bring a legal challenge against.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in addition to seeking to depose the leaders of two abortion funds, the Thomas More Society and the America First Legal Foundation have been actively threatening the abortion funds with lawsuits on social media.\nWhen the Lilith Fund tweeted a request for donations, the Thomas More Society responded by saying \u201cdonors could get sued under SB8\u201d and linking to the press release about its efforts to depose the funds\u2019 leaders.\nThis makes it clear that the anti-abortion groups intend to bring lawsuits under the Texas abortion law, the new filings argue, and thus the groups can be sued proactively to stop them from doing so.\nNeither the Thomas More Society or the America First Legal Foundation responded to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhodes has argued in several papers that this is a strong angle to challenge the law.\n\u201cThis mechanism of \u2018wait until you know someone is going to sue you, and then sue them in federal court first,\u2019 is one of the best ways to get an offensive challenge teed up to [the law],\u201d he said.\nThe filings argue that the abortion law violates advocates\u2019 right to free speech by limiting how they talk to clients, advocate for abortion access and spend their donations, which could be considered political speech. In addition, they argue it is so vague that plaintiffs may not know what conduct is allowed or prohibited; it creates special rules that only apply to these lawsuits, which violates plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection under the law; and allows lawsuits to be brought by people who do not have standing because they have not been directly injured.\nIf a federal judge agrees with some aspects of these arguments, they could grant an injunction, stopping the Thomas More Society and the America First Legal Foundation from bringing lawsuits against the two abortion funds. The lawsuit also seeks a declaration that the law is \u201cunconstitutional, void, of no effect and therefore not usable\u201d \u2014 by anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t stop anyone besides these two groups from bringing lawsuits, but it would create federal court precedent that could be cited in future litigation, Rhodes said.\nThe case would undoubtedly be appealed, which is part of the strategy. The suits are filed in Chicago, where the Thomas More Society is based, and Washington, where America First Legal Foundation is based, meaning they would go to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\nCases filed in Texas go to the extremely conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has ruled against the abortion providers at several turns already.\nRhodes said evading the 5th Circuit has the potential to create future complications \u2014 unless the case ends in a victory for the abortion funds at the U.S. Supreme Court, which would create a binding ruling that would stop lawsuits from being successfully brought under the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding the abortion argument\nUnlike previous legal challenges to the abortion law, these lawsuits deliberately sidestep the most highly politicized aspects of the law.\n\u201cThis [case] is not really about abortion,\u201d said Myers. \u201cWe\u2019re not challenging the six-week ban.\u201d\nMyers said that\u2019s not because they believe the six-week ban is constitutional, but rather because the courts may be more open to hearing arguments as to why other aspects of the law are also unconstitutional.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, states have been consistently blocked from passing abortion bans before viability, usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Those challenges have been brought by abortion providers and patients, citing their constitutional protections under Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion funds are not protected by Roe v. Wade, which makes them more vulnerable to lawsuits under Texas\u2019 abortion law. But as the U.S. Supreme Court considers a Mississippi abortion case that could overturn Roe, it may be advantageous to bring a legal challenge on other grounds.\nThe abortion funds\u2019 legal challenge is predicated on other constitutional rights \u2014 due process, standing and free speech, among other arguments \u2014 that remain in effect even if Roe is overturned.\nAmanda Beatriz Williams, the executive director of the Lilith Fund, said in a statement that group is being \u201cforced to protect the work\u201d it does.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be harassed or intimidated out of serving our community, in the courts or anywhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are proud to fight back, even when we have no choice.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
