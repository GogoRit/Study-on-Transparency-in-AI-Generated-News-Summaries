Glenn Youngkin.\nStefani Reynolds/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Virginia Republicans introduced a bill to criminalize abortion in the commonwealth after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The party is framing the ban as a moderate compromise: GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised it as a \u201cbipartisan consensus,\u201d while the Senate Republican caucus described it as \u201cpractical, sensible, and reasonable.\u201d\nBut these descriptions do not align with the actual text of the law. In addition to outlawing abortion long before viability, the proposal shares several features with the extreme abortion bans adopted by states like Louisiana and Texas. It contains extremely limited exceptions while exposing doctors to criminal liability for performing emergency abortions, including up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. In short, the ban would ensure that reproductive health care in Virginia is dictated by criminal law rather than patients and their physicians.\n\n\n\nThe measure is unlikely to pass immediately\u2014the day before its introduction, a Democrat won a close race that expanded his party\u2019s control of the state Senate. But it shows voters exactly how Republicans plan to govern, should they seize control of the legislature in next year\u2019s elections.\nThe new bill, H.B. 2278, does have several features that are absent from other red-state restrictions. It allows abortions after 15 weeks for rape and incest, and includes an explicit exception for ectopic pregnancies. (Several states, including Missouri and Tennessee, lack this exception\u2014forcing patients with ectopic pregnancies to suffer for hours while hospitals await legal clearance to terminate.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn every other way, however, this measure is unreasonable. For one thing, H.B. 2278 outlaws abortions well before viability, which occurs around 24 weeks. This new cutoff dramatically shortens the amount of time Virginians have to learn that they are pregnant and obtain an abortion. The viability line was enshrined in Roe v. Wade for nearly 50 years, and it is currently reflected in Virginia law, which allows abortions through the second trimester. Republicans want to move back the cutoff by about nine weeks.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich leads to the second problem: A large number of fetal anomalies can only be detected after 15 weeks, when scans can show fetal organ structures. Anomalies discovered during this period, such as anencephaly and Trisomy 18, render a fetus \u201cincompatible with life.\u201d That means the fetus will die during birth or shortly thereafter, its brief life spent in terrible pain. Patients who continue their pregnancy after such a diagnosis face heightened risks of serious medical complications.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nH.B. 2278\u2019s lack of an exception for even severe fetal anomalies is surely no accident. The anti-abortion movement scorns such exceptions, just as it opposes exceptions for rape and incest. Movement lobbyists support laws that force every patient to carry a pregnancy through birth even if the fetus has a \u201clife-limiting condition.\u201d Although many couples wish to spare their child the agony of a brief, torturous life, H.B. 2278 would prevent them from making that decision.\n\nThe lack of an exception for even severe fetal anomalies is surely no\u00a0accident.\n\nThere is a third glaring problem with the bill: It rejects a broad exception for the patient\u2019s health in favor of a narrow exception for the patient\u2019s life. H.B. 2278 allows doctors to perform emergency abortions after 15 weeks only after determining that \u201cthe continuation of the pregnancy will result in the death of the woman or substantially and irreversibly impair one or more of such woman\u2019s major bodily functions, not including psychological or emotional conditions.\u201d The law directs doctors to use their \u201cbest clinical judgment.\u201d But they are subject to incarceration if prosecutors disagree with their assessment and a jury determines that the abortion was unnecessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boilerplate language is found in many other states\u2019 bans, and it has already led to many harrowing cases in which women in medical crises were forced to the brink of death before obtaining an abortion. Why? A number of common medical conditions can harm pregnant patients without guaranteeing their death. Under laws like H.B. 2278, doctors must wait until these conditions spiral into a crisis before terminating. And even when a crisis arises, it\u2019s legally ambiguous when a life is sufficiently endangered to justify an abortion. Is a 10 percent chance of death acceptable? 50 percent? 75?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are not the questions doctors want to ask when a pregnant patient is experiencing a medical emergency. Yet in much of the country, they have no choice. Since Roe\u2019s demise, patients have been forced to risk hemorrhage and sepsis before doctors will terminate. Even when a pregnancy is obviously failing, laws like H.B. 2278 do not allow termination. That\u2019s why patients undergoing massive blood loss and excruciating pain have been denied care in red states, instructed to wait until they are more clearly dying. If Youngkin\u2019s ban passes, Virginia would join these states in compelling doctors to risk imprisonment when performing emergency abortions after 15 weeks.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s one final oddity buried in H.B. 2278. Emergency abortions for minors are especially fraught because Virginia already requires parents to consent to their children\u2019s abortions. (Alternatively, minors can petition a court for permission to terminate.) That restriction adds an extra layer of complication when a minor arrives at the hospital with a pregnancy-related medical crisis. Even outside the abortion context, parents typically have a right to make health care decisions for their children. But what if a parent can\u2019t be reached when a minor patient\u2019s life is at risk?\nCurrently, Virginia law allows doctors to exercise their \u201cgood faith clinical judgment\u201d when providing minors with emergency abortions, even when their parents do not or cannot consent. That standard provides a shield against prosecution, protecting doctors as long as they acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d in line with appropriate standards of care. H.B. 2278 would revoke that standard. It would inject uncertainty into pregnant minors\u2019 medical emergencies, compelling doctors to weigh their own medical judgment against the possibility of criminal charges.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Popular in\n        \n          News & Politics\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\nThe night before Republicans introduced their new abortion ban, Virginia voters effectively ensured that it will never pass. On Tuesday, Democrats won a special election that flipped a seat in the state Senate, giving them a 22\u201318 majority. The Democratic candidate, Aaron Rouse, campaigned on protecting abortion rights, and his victory all but guarantees that H.B. 2278 will die in the state legislature. Youngkin and his legislative allies appear eager to push the ban anyway. They have shown the commonwealth what maternity care would look like if the GOP had complete control of the government. Voters will decide whether to make their vision a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n  \n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nComment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n              Abortion\n            \n\n\n              Medicine\n            \n\n\n              Reproductive Rights\n            \n\n\n              Supreme Court\n            \n\n\n              Virginia\n            \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nContact\nPitch Guidelines\nSend Us Tips\nCorrections\nCommenting\nReprints\n\n\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSubscribe\nSign In\nAccount\nSubscription FAQs\nPodcast FAQs\nNewsletters\nCustomer Support\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdChoices\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\nThe Slate Group logo\n\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Instagram\n          \n\n\n\n\n            YouTube\n          \n\n\n\n\n            RSS Feed\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9\n        2024\n        The Slate Group LLC.
