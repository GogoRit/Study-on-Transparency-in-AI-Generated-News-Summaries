These guides presented a very one-dimensional snapshot of what a woman should be. Similar to the way that advertisements forced the ideal of women as mothers, much of prescriptive literature also implied that motherhood was a requirement for womanhood and vice versa.\nHow to Be A Successful Mother, Eva Featheringill, 1965. Prescriptive Literature.\nOne such guide, entitled How to be a Successful Mother, was written in 1965 by Eva Featheringill. The book\u2019s goal is to outline the steps one must take (including feeding, clothing, and caring for a baby while maintaining a home) to be a successful mother. However, messages of women\u2019s subservience and purpose are strewn throughout. One of the most prominent quotes is at the beginning of the book: \u201cMen, it seems, grow up by finding themselves. Women set out to find meaning by marrying and having children.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMen, it seems, grow up by finding themselves. Women set out to find meaning by marrying and having children.\u201d\nImmediately, the book implies that a woman\u2019s purpose comes from being a wife and mother. Her husband and child are everything to her, because they are a representation of her essence. One chapter is entitled, \u201cA Family Begins with One Baby.\u201d Without that baby, the woman becomes an orphan, as the presence of children makes a family.\u00a0\nOn the form of marriage and the roles of men and women, Featheringill says \u201cwith marriage, the machinery of our \u201croles\u201d takes over at once.\u201d Roles, of course, is here referring to the man\u2019s role as the one who works and brings in income, while the woman stays home and tend to the house and children. By using the word \u201cmachinery,\u201d one could conclude that Featheringill feels these roles are inherent and natural; that motherhood is the \u201cjob\u201d of women, as it is often referred to in the book. This belief spread beyond just one author, and by putting these beliefs within prescriptive literature, they were likely being forced upon the women who read them.\u00a0\nWhen giving advice, Featheringill explicitly states \u201cI assume you\u2019re not working (your first child is small), and I take for granted your husband\u2019s job is stable \u2013 or at least predictable.\u201d There is no hiding behind the facade of feminism. This book and others like it are explicit in their complacency with gender roles. \nAs if it was not already implied that women serve men, the baby is referred to throughout as a \u201che.\u201d The women must take care of the men in all ways at all ages; from birth to adulthood, she cares for him. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not your day, it\u2019s the baby\u2019s,\u201d the author exclaims. Women lose all anonymity and are nothing more than mothers. It tells women that they will find they \u201cneed\u201d to have more children, and will \u201clike just about everything\u201d in their lives, if only they follow the simple steps in this book.\nWoman\u2019s Medical Problems, Maxine Davis, 1953. Prescriptive Literature.\nThese messages were everywhere. Even in a 1953 book of prescriptive literature entitled Woman\u2019s Medical Problems, the idea that all women were mothers and would have children was present throughout. The majority of the book is spent on pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, contraception, and infertility. \u201cYou are going to have a baby,\u201d author Maxine Davis makes known. \u201cYou always wanted to have a baby,\u201d she says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDr. Jean Kilbourne, feminist and media critic, said \u201cIt seemed like such a given that women should want to be mothers and that this was the ultimate experience for all women, and this was rarely challenged in those days.\u201d Maxine Davis makes this explicit in her book. \nIn Woman\u2019s Medical Problems, pregnancy is described as \u201cone of the most important events in any woman\u2019s life\u201d and having a child, \u201cone of the profoundest needs of humankind.\u201d Infertility is \u201cdepriving your husband of his right of fatherhood.\u201d Childless marriages are \u201csad\u201d and careers are not a \u201creal competition\u201d to motherhood because women are usually \u201cglad\u201d to give up their jobs to be mothers (if they ever worked at all). \nWomen who do not want children are \u201crelatively rare\u201d according to Davis. The reasons for not wanting to have a baby are shallow with a select few women not wanting to \u201cruin their figures\u201d or \u201cbe tied down.\u201d \u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAll of these messages found in prescriptive literature served as subliminal counterarguments to the reproductive rights movement. With ideas of motherhood being presented as the only realities for women, fighting for access to birth control and the legality of abortions did not necessarily align. In the chapters on abortion and contraception in Woman\u2019s Medical Problems, these previously implicit protests against the movement are made explicit.\nBirth control is referred to in Woman\u2019s Medical Problems as an \u201cethical problem\u201d and abortion \u201cone of the tragedies of mankind\u201d and a \u201csin against the one of the most profound instincts of the [human] race;\u201d a sin against \u201cthe law, the Church, and nature.\u201d Davis goes on to call abortion \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cimmoral.\u201d And if all of that was not enough to make it clear that to see women as mothers was to be against the reproductive rights movement, Davis gives explicit orders: \u201cBear your baby.\u201d\nWhile women tried to fight for the right to control their bodies, they not only had these narratives standing in the way, but they were also influenced and affected by these portrayals of women. Ms. magazine did a story in 1976 that showed how the necessity of motherhood made women feel. Those without children, regardless of their work, were left feeling like \u201cthe \u2018barren\u2019 woman, the human failure.\u201d Those who thought they could ignore the influences of prescriptive literature and advertisements showing women as mothers were simply not looking hard enough (A Challenge To All Your Ideas About Motherhood & Daughterhood, 1976).\u00a0\n\n\u201cAny woman who believes that the institution of motherhood has nothing to do with her is closing her eyes to crucial aspects of her situation.\u201d\n\u2013 Adrienne Rich, 1976.\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 Consuming Women, Liberating Women: Women and Advertising in the Mid 20th Century\n\n\nTheme by Anders Noren \u2014 Up \u2191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSites@Duke Express is powered by WordPress.
