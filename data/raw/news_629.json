Kristi Noem Pimps Proposed Abortion Ban, Downplays SD Covid Problem\n\n\n\nPosted by Priscilla -26.60pc on January 13, 2021\n\u00b7 Flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFox News\u2019 Rachel Campos-Duffy, mother of nine, really hates abortion. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising to see Rachel, on yesterday\u2019s Friends & Friends lovefest, join her husband and SD Gov. Kristi Noem to promote Noem\u2019s proposed Down\u2019s Syndrome diagnosis abortion ban. COVID? What COVID? Everything is great!!!!!Noem began by summarizing what she plans to cover in her upcoming address to the South Dakota legislature. The only reference to the coronavirus, which has ravaged her state, was the phrase, \u201cthe challenging year that we\u2019ve had.\u201d And during the \u201cchallenging year,\u201d Noem\u00a0opposed mask mandates and lockdowns at a time when her state had one of the worst COVID rates in the country. In response to the state\u2019s attempt to delay a trial, due to COVID, a judge excoriated the state for doing next to nothing to contain the pandemic.\nIn noting how her state is focused on (ahem) \u201cprotecting life,\u201d\u00a0Noem discussed her proposed bill which would ban abortions based on a Down\u2019s Syndrome diagnosis. As she spoke about how \u201cevery single life is precious,\u201d Rachel and her husband, former GOP US Rep. Sean Duffy, played with their 9th child who has Down\u2019s Syndrome. Noem added that Down\u2019s Syndrome children, like Valentina Duffy, are \u201cblessings\u201d and that the Duffys will be speaking to the legislature about the proposed law.\nCampos-Duffy said that she was very proud of Noem who is \u201ca mom governor.\u201d Working in the perfunctory Fox & Friends GOP talking points, she claimed that in this time when \u201cso many people are being censored,\u201d Noem \u201cis giving a voice to a group of people, who don\u2019t have a voice, who don\u2019t have a lobby, who don\u2019t have anyone to fight for them\u2026\u201d \u2013 a ridiculous assertion given the money and power of the \u201cRight to Life\u201d lobby as well as the Catholic Church.\nCampos-Duffy, spoke to women facing a Down\u2019s diagnosis about the joy that this child has brought to her life and that as an American, \u201cshe has a right to live.\u201d Sean Duffy added that other parents of Down\u2019s children told them that having a Down\u2019s child is \u201cthe greatest experience you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d (Unlike poor women, the Duffy\u2019s have the money to provide the necessary resources for this child, but nobody mentioned that.)\nIn validating the anti-mask adherents, Noem interjected commentary on the \u201cgreat\u201d state of the South Dakota economy because there were no shut-downs and that the \u201cpeople are happy because we let them use personal responsibility to get through the pandemic.\u201d She segued back to abortion with the comment that she\u2019s about \u201cgiving every single person the opportunity to live \u2026 and to be a part of the story of America.\u201d\nCohost Ainsley Earhardt validated the Trump and the right wing\u2019s belief that COVID shut-downs were unnecessary by mentioning that Noem received great praise for her non-shut-down strategy.\nIn response to the question of the current state of COVID in South Dakota, Noem avoided numbers. She merely said that a \u201cvery different conversation\u201d was being had and went on to talk about the awesomeness of the South Dakota economy because \u201cwe are blessed.\u201d She said that \u201cwhat we believe as conservatives works.\u201d\nSean Duffy further validated the anti-mask position as he effused over how wonderful it was to have dinner at a South Dakota restaurant where diners didn\u2019t have to wear a mask. He ended with the propaganda pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, \u201cThis is what freedom looks like in South Dakota.\"\nSo while it\u2019s nice to showcase how Down\u2019s Syndrome children can be a source of joy, there was no mention of the different levels of severity or the host of physical problems which Down\u2019s children could encounter. Rather, little Valentina (very cute) was used as a prop to push a GOP governor\u2019s proposed anti-abortion law which might not pass a constitutional test.\u00a0\nEven worse, Noem\u2019s claim to support \u201clife\u201d seems dubious when, \u201caccording to Becker's Hospital Review, South Dakota has the seventh highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the nation, trailing only North Dakota and states in the densely populated northeast United States that bore the first wave of the illness in the U.S.\u201d The positivity rate is 32.8% and the number of active cases is 5,102. Almost 6,000 people have been hospitalized.\nSo if Kristi Noem gets her way, South Dakota women will be forced to carry a Down\u2019s child to term; but folks who might have COVID don\u2019t need to wear a mask. Guess that\u2019s just \u201cfreedom\u201d for ya!!\nYou can watch the \u201cpro-life\u201d hypocrisy below, from the January 12, 2021 Fox & Friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @NewsHounds\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com\n\n\n\n\nDo you like this post?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to comment\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional email code\n\n\n\n\n              \n                \u00a0 \u00a0 Review the site rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional email code\n\n\n\n\n \n\nor sign in with\n\t\t\t\tFacebook or\n\t\t\t\temail.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @NewsHounds on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n Subscribe with RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        We\u2019ve updated our Privacy Policy\n\n\nAccept\n\n\nReject\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        \r\n           Sign in with Facebook, Twitter or email.\r\n        \r\n        \n\n\r\n          Created with NationBuilder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
