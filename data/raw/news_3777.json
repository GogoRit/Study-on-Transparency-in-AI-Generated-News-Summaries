Grubb, MD, director of adolescent medicine at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, said in an interview.AAP recommends pediatricians consider the following when discussing sexuality and reproductive health with adolescent males:Discuss the topics of sex and sexuality during routine visits and appropriate opportunities, taking the time to screen for sexual activity and identifying who is at higher risk.Ask male adolescent patients about social media use, how often they view pornography, and how they perceive sexually explicit material. If there is a concern that sexually explicit content is having an adverse effect on the patient, pediatricians should counsel patients and their parents on how to safely and sensibly use the Internet and social media.Screen for nonconsensual sexual activity during well visits and other visits, as appropriate. The principles of consent and nonconsent in the context of sexual activity should be discussed.For patients who are sexually active, screen for sexual problems, including any mental health issues and sexual dysfunction, and initiate counseling or pharmacotherapy where warranted.Coach male adolescent patients on broaching discussions about sex and family planning with their partners, including joint decision making on sexual and reproductive health. Contraception and barrier methods should be discussed and encouraged as appropriate.Assess each patient for appropriate STI risk, testing, and treatment/prevention for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.Consider HPV vaccination for children at least 9 years old and start administration starting at 11 years old. Pediatricians should \u201caim for complete HPV vaccination for all male patients,\u201d especially for those patients who engage in high-risk behaviors, according to the guidance.Dr. Grubb said she hopes this guidance helps start a conversation between pediatricians and their adolescent male patients. \u201cTalk with your male adolescents about puberty, sexuality, and reproductive health! When pediatricians are informed about these issues and take the initiative to discuss these topics with adolescent males, they are uniquely situated to help them navigate this challenging time safely and confidently.\u201d\u201cI am especially excited about the significant resources this report provides for pediatricians in the supplemental document,\u201d Dr. Grubb added. \u201cThere are so many great resources out there, especially on the Internet, for adolescents, parents, and pediatricians.\u201d\n\nDr. Kelly Curran \n\nKelly Curran, MD, adolescent medicine specialist and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, said in an interview that the guidance information on sexting, \u201csextortion,\u201d and sexual dysfunction are important updates for pediatricians. Sextortion is defined as the \u201cthreatened dissemination of explicit, intimate, or embarrassing images of a sexual nature without consent, usually for the purpose of procuring additional images, sexual acts, money, or something else.\u201d\u201cWe have all seen how social media and technology has transformed adolescence, especially with the rise of sexting. We must remember that males are often the victims of \u2018sextortion\u2019 and sexual assault, especially sexual minority youth, and men may not have the support and services to which female victims have access,\u201d said Dr. Curran, who was not a member of the committee.Another important area where pediatricians can help educate adolescent males and their parents is the concept of consent during sexual encounters.\u201cAs we as a society are having more frank discussions around sexual assault and rape, I think it is essential there is a continued dialogue with young people about consent. Pediatricians have an important role to play in the discussion with their patients, especially in regard to paying attention to verbal and nonverbal cues, and recognizing that consent is an ongoing process, instead of a \u2018one time thing,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Dr. Curran, who is a member of the Pediatric News editorial advisory board.One area of the new AAP guidance that surprised Dr. Curran was the number of adolescent males reporting sexual dysfunction \u2013 4%. \u201cWhile it\u2019s something I ask about periodically in young men, I haven\u2019t been consistently asking in visits for those who are at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThis guideline reminds me to screen more frequently, especially as patients may be too embarrassed to ask.\u201dConcerning STI screening, Dr. Curran feels guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) don\u2019t go far enough, and the AAP\u2019s guidance to provide routine STI risk assessment for all patients is more appropriate.\u201cWe know that STIs are on the rise and adolescents experience high rates of STI, yet there are only routine screening guidelines for adolescent and young adult women and \u2018at-risk\u2019 populations or in areas of higher prevalence,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my experience, all sexually active adolescents are \u2018at risk.\u2019 I think there should be universal screening of all sexually active adolescents and young adults.\u201dThe paper had no funding source, and the authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest. Dr. Curran also reported no relevant conflicts of interest.SOURCE: Grubb L et al.
