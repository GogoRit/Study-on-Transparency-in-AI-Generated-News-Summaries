Andrew Sorrell, which would ban deadly Chemical Abortion Pills from being sold and distributed in state. Video of the 1:30 p.m. Central event can be seen here. \u00a0\nSFLAction has been a leader in the fight to stop Chemical Abortion Pill distribution. Click here to read more about the 14 states that engaged this legislative session on the issue.\nPictures and video of the event will be available after at Students for Life Action\u2019s website, but Stratmann will make some of the following remarks on behalf of the 11\u00a0Students for Life groups in\u00a0high\u00a0schools and colleges across the state of\u00a0Alabama, part of SFLA\u2019s almost 1,300 student groups in every state across the country. \u00a0\nShe observes: \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started in a massive effort to fight back against predatory corporate abortion interests and oppose them at every turn in this new frontier of chemical abortions.\u00a0The actions of the FDA under the Biden administration\u2019s influence have made it clear\u00a0that\u00a0states are the first and only line of defense protecting women and the preborn from these\u00a0deadly pills. By using the pandemic as an excuse to gut federal safeguards requiring in-person dispensing, the FDA has blown open the door for those who traffic and coerce women, with little regard for\u00a0the reportedly\u00a03\u00a0to 8 percent\u00a0who will be left to suffer significant complications requiring emergency care.\u00a0That\u2019s between a hundred and twenty thousand and three\u00a0hundred and twenty thousand women who will\u00a0experience\u00a0these\u00a0complications.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBecause these abortions are\u00a0committed\u00a0at home\u00a0or\u00a0even in a college dorm,\u00a0many\u00a0women may not even realize they are experiencing an adverse effect. The patient and healthcare provider relationship\u00a0is\u00a0distant\u00a0at best, and in\u00a0some\u00a0cases, the doctor may be in a completely different state.\u00a0Chemical abortions do not\u00a0provide\u00a0the necessary observation\u00a0in which healthcare professionals would be able\u00a0to catch the signs and symptoms of a complication. That medical judgement is left up to a woman at home by herself,\u00a0likely googling\u00a0her symptoms and trying to decide if\u00a0she\u2019s\u00a0just being paranoid.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThese pills are dangerous to women, and lethal to babies. They end the life of a preborn child, and are even more dangerous to women than surgical abortion, causing 4x more complications. The pills can cause infertility if used\u00a0improperly and\u00a0can even be slipped into the drinks of pregnant women.\u00a0\u00a0Planned Parenthood has set up authorization in all 50 states\u00a0that would make it possible to bring deadly chemical abortion pills to underage girls across the nation on-line with just a few clicks, confidentially, with no safeguards or follow-up care in their new \u201cAbortion by Amazon\u201d world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIn addition to not being safe, there is no legal protection for chemical abortion in Alabama.\u00a0In 2018, an amendment to the\u00a0Constitution of Alabama of 1901 declared and affirmed the\u00a0public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of\u00a0preborn life and the rights of\u00a0preborn children. The amendment made it clear that the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 does not include a right to an abortion.\u00a0I urge you to act in accordance with this precedent and vote\u00a0to protect the rights of the preborn. Chemical abortions are not safe and can have long term negative effects on women and their fertility.\u00a0Please vote yes on\u00a0House\u00a0Bill\u00a0377\u00a0to protect women and children\u00a0from the abortion industry.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nRecently, Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins and Sen. Steve Daines co-authored an op-ed in\u00a0Newsweek\u00a0detailing the current crisis and how political activists are playing politics to advance abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThey wrote: \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s chemical abortion gambit also reveals a deep hypocrisy. Consider that on\u00a0the same day\u00a0news was breaking about the gutted health and safety standards for chemical abortion, the FDA also announced it was pulling the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine because, out of 7 million people who had taken it, six had suffered blood clots and one person died. Yet despite the fact that chemical abortion pills have been a factor in the deaths of\u00a0more than 20 women and millions of unborn children, Biden\u2019s FDA not only kept the drugs on the market, but authorized, in effect, a nationwide experiment in do-it-yourself abortions. There was no semblance of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d\u00a0in\u00a0the FDA\u2019s abortion pill announcement.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nLearn more about how Chemical Abortion harms women and preborn children at\u00a0THISISCHEMICALABORTION.com.\u00a0\nStay up to date on the Pro-Life Generation\u2019s engagement in state legislation at\u00a0https://studentsforlifeaction.org.\nFor interviews, e-mail Kristi Hamrick at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].\n\u201330\u2013\nStudents for Life Action\u00a0(SFLAction)\u00a0is the 501c4\u00a0sister organization\u00a0of Students for Life of America (SFLA), the nation\u2019s largest, pro-life, student organization with more than 1,240\u00a0groups on middle,\u00a0high school,\u00a0and university campuses in all 50 states.\u00a0Students for Life has more conversations with those most targeted by the abortion industry every day, week, and year than any other pro-life outreach in the world and mobilizes the Pro-Life Generation to confront abortion at the local, state, and national levels daily.\u00a0Every week,\u00a0Students for Life entities reach more than 2 million people across social media platforms to have nearly 200,000 digital conversations with the most engaged pro-life online audience in the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents for Life of America\u00a0(SFLA)\u00a0is the nation\u2019s largest, pro-life, youth organization.
