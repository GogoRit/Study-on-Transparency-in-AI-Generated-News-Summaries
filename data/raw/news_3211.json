Pritzker signs bill rescinding requirement that minors notify parents before abortionSpringfield Catholic Bishop Thomas John Paprocki\u00a0said the church believes that human life begins at conception.\u00a0He said he feels\u00a0it is important to get youths\u00a0involved in the anti-abortion cause.\u201cThe culture is shaping their (children\u2019s)\u00a0views and beliefs. Our culture is not sympathetic or protective of unborn babies,\u201d Paprocki said. \u201cWe want to teach (students)\u00a0both from a scientific point of view as well as from a religious point of view that they should respect all human life from that very first moment of conception.\u201dJacob Mizera, a junior at Sacred Heart-Griffin High School, participated in the march.\u201cEspecially with our culture today, they (pro-choice culture)\u00a0want to silence us, and they want to make us think that we don\u2019t have a group, and we don\u2019t have enough numbers, but I think we do. That was proved today with 700 people, and it\u2019s really exciting to make our voices heard and show people that yes, this is a popular idea (protecting life), and this is the truth,\u201d Mizera said.Illinois news:Republicans confirm 'slate' of candidates with Richard Irvin at the topPlanned Parenthood of Illinois issued a statement on the march.\"While Planned Parenthood of Illinois does not share the views of organizations that stand in the way of people having access to essential sexual and reproductive health care, we respect the right of any organization to protest and peacefully assemble,\"\u00a0said Paula Thornton Greear, \u200bchief external affairs and reputation management officer for Planned Parenthood of Illinois.Paprocki said there are Catholic charities set in place to help young women who are perhaps afraid or don\u2019t have the proper resources to care for a child.
