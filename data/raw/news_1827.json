(AP) \u2014 Abortion-rights groups filed a court motion Tuesday to dismiss their lawsuit challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total abortion ban but signaled that the legal fight is far from over.The groups\u2019 strategy will focus on the next legal challenge expected to come from pregnant women who were denied abortion services in Kentucky.\u201cWe will be back in court when we have a patient plaintiff,\u201d Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said in a statement.The current suit was filed by attorneys for the only two abortion clinics left in Kentucky when the state\u2019s ban on the procedure took effect following the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.The plaintiffs in the Kentucky suit failed to get abortion access restored in a February ruling by Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court that focused on narrow legal issues. The justices didn\u2019t resolve larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the Bluegrass State.\n\nAbortion providers challenged the ban on the premise that it violated patients\u2019 constitutional rights, but the state\u2019s high court ruled that the providers lacked the \u201cthird-party standing\u201d to do so. The justices sent the case back to a circuit court in Louisville. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky Senate proposes conditions for providing funds for the state\u2019s Office of Medical Cannabis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Kentucky House votes to defund diversity, equity and inclusion offices at public universities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVice President Harris and rapper Fat Joe team up for discussion on easing marijuana penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, handing a victory to abortion-rights supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcome highlighted what appeared to be a gap between voter sentiment and the expectations of Kentucky\u2019s GOP-dominated Legislature.The legal challenge brought by the Louisville abortion providers revolves around Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban \u2014 both passed by the state\u2019s Legislature. The trigger law was passed in 2019 and took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned. It bans abortions except when they\u2019re carried out to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.\n\nRepublican state Attorney General Daniel Cameron\u2019s office has defended the bans. Cameron said Tuesday that his office will steadfastly defend the state\u2019s anti-abortion laws.\u201cWe are gratified that the abortion providers recognized their case should be dismissed,\u201d Cameron said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of our efforts, I am proud to say that the elective abortion industry is out of business in Kentucky.\u201dAddia Wuchner, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life, hailed the development as a victory for anti-abortion groups, who strive to make the procedure \u201cunthinkable.\u201dSince the state\u2019s near-complete abortion ban took effect, abortion-rights groups say they have helped Kentuckians \u201cget the care they need, including helping patients find care out of state.\u201dThe groups opposing the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood, said Tuesday that the motion to dismiss the suit stemmed from the state Supreme Court\u2019s ruling \u201cthat took away health care providers\u2019 ability to defend the rights of their patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cBringing cases on behalf of patients has been standard practice in Kentucky and across the country for good reason \u2014 numerous obstacles stand in the way of patients coming forward to participate in litigation,\u201d the groups said in a statement.The question before the Kentucky justices in their February ruling was whether there was a reason to reinstate a lower court\u2019s injunction and block the bans from being enforced.\u201cTo be clear, this opinion does not in any way determine whether the Kentucky Constitution protects or does not protect the right to receive an abortion, as no appropriate party to raise that issue is before us,\u201d Deputy Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert wrote. \u201cNothing in this opinion shall be construed to prevent an appropriate party from filing suit at a later date.\u201dNow abortion-rights advocates say they\u2019ll team up with people who are pregnant and interested in challenging the abortion bans \u2014 in an effort to help restore access to the procedure in Kentucky.\u201cThis fight is far from over,\u201d Wieder said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
