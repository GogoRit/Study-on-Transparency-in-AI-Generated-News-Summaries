Wade\u2019 Now Protects Human Life By Jonathan English|2020-05-21T00:18:43-05:00May 20th, 2020|Categories: Abortion, American Republic, Compassion, Constitution| \n\n\nAs a majority of states have rejected the application of capital punishment in certain cases, United States law has moved toward mercy, away from cruelty. Consensus about human dignity and the inception of human life now calls for a similar move at the beginning of life.\n\nJust Mercy\nIn his book Just Mercy, attorney Bryan Stevenson recounts an arduous struggle on behalf of clients for justice and mercy against unusual cruelty. The principal narrative of the book\u2014and the focus of the new film\u2014is the riveting story of Walter McMillian, a black resident of Monroe County Alabama who was sentenced to death for another person\u2019s crime. I can\u2019t praise the book highly enough. It\u2019s a tale of suspense, an education, and an inspiration.\nAlong the way, the book also tells of several landmark Supreme Court victories that have moved the United States away from cruel and unusual punishment. As a majority of states have rejected the application of capital punishment in certain cases, United States law has moved toward mercy, away from cruelty. Consensus about human dignity and the inception of human life now calls for a similar move at the beginning of life.\nThe Roe Decision\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade\u00a0recognized a right to abortion, founded on privacy, up to viability. Decades after the decision, fixed abortion rights and Roe v. Wade\u00a0now seem nearly synonymous. However, the truth is more nuanced. Attentive reading shows conditionality and latent humility in the decision.\nRemarkably, the Court conceded that if the fetus is a person under the Fourteenth Amendment, there would be no right to obtain an abortion because the right to abortion would be superseded by the person\u2019s right to life. In the words of the Court, \u201c[i]f this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant\u2019s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus\u2019 right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the [Fourteenth] Amendment.\u201d\nHowever, while the Court did not conclude that a fetus is a person under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court inserted a fascinating point, a critical caveat or disclaimer. The Court acknowledged that its opinion was the product of a specific moment in time, dependent on extant factual knowledge and lack of consensus at the time, subject to possible \u201cdevelopment.\u201d It stated that, given a lack of \u201cany consensus\u201d then on the question when human life begins, the judiciary \u201cat this point in the development of man\u2019s knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\u201d In a fact- and time-sensitive move, the Court left open the possibility or eventuality that if sufficient consensus about the beginning of human life emerged, the parameters of abortion rights would be required to shift with the consensus to protect agreed-upon human life in the womb. Its conclusion was explicitly contingent on the lack of consensus about human life at the time.\nThis raises an obvious question. In the nearly fifty years since Roe\u2014a long time in both science and law\u2014has there been any development in the level of agreement or consensus on when human life begins? It turns out, science and law have not been stagnant. Surprising consensus has emerged on this point\u2014human life is understood to begin well before viability. To faithfully follow Roe, we must follow this consensus and protect new human life before viability. The analysis of Roe\u00a0mandates protection of this agreed-upon human life.\nConsensus on Abortion and Human Life and Dignity\nThis consensus appears in many ways. For example, (1) new (post-Roe) laws protect human life in the womb before viability at both the state and federal levels; (2) new uniform definitions of death indicate emergence of human life early in development; (3) public opinion agrees that human life begins early in development; and (4) international law shows current American abortion law to be an aberration or outlier worldwide.[1]\nFirst, a majority of states, and the federal government, have enacted fetal homicide laws to protect new human life from criminal harm before viability.[2] Thirty states extend this protection throughout pregnancy. (Or if Virginia\u2019s law is interpreted to begin protection only after the embryonic stage, then twenty-nine.) Two more states, including California, protect human life starting at the end of the embryonic stage, at about the end of week seven or eight of development. Two additional states protect human life at quickening, when fetal movement can first be felt in the womb, which has been recorded as early as twelve weeks.[3] (Altogether, this amounts to 34 states, or 68% of all states, i.e. a supermajority.)\nWhile these laws often provide that they do not apply to an abortion elected by the woman (avoiding direct conflict with Roe), they evidence a powerful message about the dignity of the human life being protected. First, almost invariably such laws explicitly define a term like \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cunborn child\u201d as encompassing the new human being at any stage of development in the womb. Second, these laws typically impose severe punishments for harm to the fetus, punishments that are warranted in degree only if the fetus is understood to be a human life, not just a potential, future human life. Third, these laws establish a separate offense for harming the fetus, rather than simply enhancing the penalty for an offense against the woman.\nAs one example, the federal Unborn Victims of Violence Act (UVVA), enacted with wide support in 2004, uses the term \u201cunborn child\u201d and explicitly defines \u201cunborn child\u201d as \u201ca member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\u201d[4] As for punishment, with the exception of the death penalty, the penalties imposed for harming an unborn child correspond to the penalties imposed for harming a more mature human being.[5] And the UVVA explicitly identifies harm to the unborn child as a separate offense.[6]\nThese laws are critically significant. To understand their significance, it\u2019s imperative to realize that the Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, specifically relied on the absence of such legal protections for fetuses in the womb in reaching its conclusion on the (then-applicable) parameters of abortion rights. Likewise, in Doe v. Bolton, the 1973 companion case to Roe, Justice Douglas\u2019s concurring opinion specifically noted that \u201c[n]o prosecutor has ever returned a murder indictment charging the taking of the life of a fetus.\u201d Given our evolving standards of decency, described above, this is no longer the case. The fundamental facts relied on in Roe\u00a0have changed.\nA second change is reflected in consensus and codification concerning determination of death. Since Roe v. Wade, a supermajority of states have adopted the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA).[7] This legislation provides that death may be determined by either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. The corollary principle is that if either (1) the circulatory or respiratory functions or (2) any part of the brain, including the brainstem, is active, then human life is deemed to be present. Based on this definition, the implication arises that human life begins early in development, during the first trimester, well before viability. Regarding circulatory function, fetal cardiac activity or heartbeat begins a regular rhythm during week four or five of development (week six or seven of gestational age).[8] Regarding brain development and function, the brainstem has begun formation and activity by at least week seven or eight of development.[9]\nIndeed, even public opinion polls show the antiquated nature of Roe\u2019s choice of viability as the moment at which human life may be protected. This expression of public conscience represents a third indication or type of consensus. For example, the January 2020 Marist Poll found that 70% of Americans think abortion should be limited to, at most, the first trimester.[10] Likewise, repeated polls in recent years all show that a majority of Americans believe human life begins at least during the first trimester.[11] Several polls in the past two decades show a majority of Americans concluding that human life begins at conception (though not polls in the last couple years). With each subsequent stage of prenatal development, agreement grows that human life is present. Thus, when one considers those who believe human life begins at conception, those who believe it begins by implantation (by about two weeks), those who believe it begins with cardiac activity or heartbeat, and those who believe it begins with initiation of brainstem activity, a significant and sufficient consensus is reached that human life has begun.\nInternationally, America\u2019s status quo on abortion is a somewhat extreme outlier as well. This aberration of American law is a fourth indicator that it deviates from consensus. Only seventeen of 199 countries worldwide, counted by the Center for Reproductive Rights, permit abortion without restriction as to reason beyond week ten of development (week twelve gestational age).[12] (Oddly, the Center inaccurately counts Puerto Rico separately from the United States, though it falls under U.S. jurisdiction and constitutional law. To see the duration of a right to unrestricted abortion, look at the footnotes to Box IV of the Center\u2019s chart in the linked page.) That is 8% of the world\u2019s nations.\nFurther, only nine of 199 countries permit abortion without restriction as to reason beyond week twelve of development (week fourteen gestational age). Or only eight, not counting Puerto Rico separately. That amounts to only 4% of the world\u2019s nations. Certainly, America\u2019s status quo on abortion\u2014guaranteeing abortion up to viability for any reason\u2014is out of line with consensus.\nIronically, Justice Blackmun\u2019s second draft of the Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision would have established a right to abortion only up to the end of the first trimester. In a November 21, 1972 memorandum accompanying this draft, he suggested this was arbitrary, as arbitrary as any other moment for limiting abortion rights\u2014including viability.[13] (Indeed, Justice Douglas, who ultimately joined the majority in Roe, communicated in a memorandum on December 11, 1972, that he would have preferred to limit abortion rights to the first trimester only, stating simply, \u201cI favor the first trimester, rather than viability.\u201d) However, in light of recent consensus, if there is to be a window for abortion, consensus would indicate a less arbitrary moment to begin recognition and protection of new human life\u2014e.g. the beginning of the fetal heartbeat (or cardiac activity), or the beginning of electrical brainstem activity (which is present at the beginning of the fetal stage of development). By this point, human life is defined to be present under the UDDA. By this latter point, thirty-two states protect new human life from criminal harm.\nUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s consensus analysis in another context, this majority-level consensus was enough to signal rejection of the cruel practice of capital punishment for intellectually disabled offenders in Atkins v. Virginia\u00a0(2002). It was enough to prompt rejection of the cruelty of capital punishment for juvenile offenders in Roper v. Simmons\u00a0(2005). It was enough to prompt rejection of the cruelty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders in Graham v. Florida\u00a0(2010) and Miller v. Alabama\u00a0(2012). Now, it is enough to reject cruelty at the beginning of human life as well. Given recent consensus, Roe v. Wade\u00a0requires this minimal protection. Agreed-upon human life has inalienable dignity and deserves, even requires, protection. We can all agree on this. Human rights begin in the womb, because human life begins in the womb. At the same time, it should be affirmed that the mother\u2019s life has undeniable, unquantifiable dignity, and protection of her life may allow abortion as an exception in some cases, as almost everyone agrees.\nThis consensus is open to both progressive Democrats and Republicans. It doesn\u2019t depend on who is President. It doesn\u2019t depend on the Supreme Court initially. (Trial courts engage in fact-finding to assess current, relevant facts; apart from judicial notice, appellate courts do not.) Nor does it involve overturning Roe v. Wade. This analysis simply applies the analysis in Roe\u00a0to current facts and consensus. Even pro-choice folk can agree with a consensus that would protect human life from the beginning of brain formation and brainstem activity. Most abortions occur before then. Almost two-thirds, in fact.[14] More specifically, 65.4% of abortions in the United States occur before or during week six of development (eight of gestation), and 91.1% before or during week eleven of development (thirteen of gestation).\nSome skeptics might point to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey\u00a0(1992), to note that the Court affirmed the central holding of Roe\u00a0when asked to reexamine its precedent in 1992. However, much of the development in consensus noted above has taken place after the Casey\u00a0decision. Even more importantly, in reaching its conclusion in Casey, the Court engaged in a very limited review, noting only narrow factual developments\u2014that \u201cadvances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973 . . . and\u00a0advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier.\u201d The Court has yet to consider the changed factual landscape alluded to above. As the Court itself said, in Casey,\u00a0a \u201cchange in Roe\u2019s factual underpinning\u201d or a change in the \u201cunderstanding of [the relevant] facts,\u201d could render \u201c[Roe v. Wade\u2019s] central holding obsolete.\u201d Picking up on this language, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently called on the Supreme Court to reevaluate its jurisprudence on abortion, noting that \u201cthe facts underlying Roe\u00a0and Casey\u00a0may have changed\u201d and \u201cthe Court\u2019s viability standard has proven unsatisfactory.\u201d[15]\u00a0Fidelity to facts and fidelity to Roe\u00a0now require protection of agreed-upon human life well before viability.\nBending Toward Justice\nIn his introduction to Just Mercy, Mr. Stevenson writes:\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us. The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.\n\nThis call to justice, to wrap others in a shield of minimum protective dignity, applies to the accused and those at the end of life. It also applies to those innocent ones at the beginning of life, even in the womb, before viability. Consensus agrees on this now. Roe v. Wade\u00a0now requires this protection. Progress in mercy\u2014both at the end of life and at the beginning\u2014is slowly bending our society toward justice.\nThe Imaginative Conservative\u00a0applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics\u2014we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility. Will you help us remain a refreshing oasis in the increasingly contentious arena of modern discourse? Please consider\u00a0donating now.\nNotes:\n[1] For expanded discussion, with further facts and nuance, see the law review article, \u201cAbortion Evolution: How Roe v.

Many years ago I noted the same thing about Roe as you did and this is probably the first article I\u2019ve ever seen on the topic.  But there\u2019s something I don\u2019t think I\u2019m following.  I get the argument about how we have more of a consensus that life begins by the end of the first trimester and that most Americans believe that\u2019s what it should be limited to as opposed to the Roe benchmark of viability.  But if it\u2019s also true that \u201c91.1% (occur) before or during week eleven of development,\u201d then is it really a game changer?  \nOne might say, for the 8.9 percent it is!  And I get that.  But.  I believe you got those numbers from the CDC, which also states that only 1.2 percent of abortions happen after 21 weeks.  Since viability is about 24 weeks, and some percentage of that 1.2 percent are due to serious medical issues (and many others are due to lack of access), what we end up with is not something that feels significant (from a legal perspective.  I am not addressing the moral element here).  \nFrom the perspective that even one life saved as a result of updating Roe matters, yes, it is significant.  But I think we should be clear that (unless I\u2019m missing something; if so, please correct me), it would not matter 97.8 percent of the time and, thus, our consensus achieves very little.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchris\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 21, 2020 at 5:44 pm - Reply \n\n*sorry, should be 98.8 percent, not 97.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 25, 2020 at 1:54 pm - Reply \n\nChris, I would point you back to the article, which should answer your question or comment.  More specifically, note the following:  \n\u201c[I]n light of recent consensus, if there is to be a window for abortion, consensus would indicate a less arbitrary moment to begin recognition and protection of new human life\u2014e.g. the beginning of the fetal heartbeat (or cardiac activity), or the beginning of electrical brainstem activity (which is present at the beginning of the fetal stage of development).\u201d\n\u201cRegarding circulatory function, fetal cardiac activity or heartbeat begins a regular rhythm during week four or five of development (week six or seven of gestational age). Regarding brain development and function, the brainstem has begun formation and activity by at least week seven or eight of development.\u201d\nIf there are around 862,320 abortions per year in the U.S., as reported by the Guttmacher Institute, and 34.6% of those occur after week six of development (during week seven or later), as indicated above, then more up to date application of Roe could avert as many as around 300,000 abortions per year, more or less.  Roe v. Wade would then play a significant role in protecting agreed upon human life.  Through the teaching function of the law, it would also enhance consistent societal respect for human life.  If you\u2019d like more information, feel free to look up the law review article cited in the article above.
