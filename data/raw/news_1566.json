State of Utah\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproductive Justice \u00a0 / \u00a0 Last Updated: August 8, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Summary\n\nLWV Utah filed an amicus brief in the Utah Supreme Court supporting a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood of Utah seeking to overturn the state\u2019s abortion ban. The complaint argued the ban violated Utahn\u2019s rights to determine their family composition and to parent, equal protection of the laws, uniform operation of the law, bodily autonomy, freedom from involuntary servitude, conscience, and to\u00a0privacy under the state constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn 2020, the Utah Legislature enacted a ban on abortion that would take effect if Roe v. Wade were overturned by the United States Supreme Court. On June 24, 2022, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abolishing the federal right to an abortion. As a result, the ban took effect shortly thereafter.\nThe new abortion ban forbids all abortions in Utah with several narrow exceptions. Abortions may only be performed if necessary to prevent the death or if there is, \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\u201d of the mother. Abortions are also permitted if a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest and reported to law enforcement. Beyond these exceptions, any person who violates the ban is guilty of a second-class felony, punishable by one to fifteen years in prison and/or a fine of up to $10,000.\nOn June 25, 2022, Planned Parenthood of Utah filed a lawsuit in the Third Judicial District Court for Salt Lake County, arguing the ban violated the right to choose one\u2019s family composition and to parent, equal protection of the laws, uniform operation of the laws, bodily autonomy, freedom from involuntary servitude, conscience, and\u00a0privacy protected under Utah state law.\nOn July 19, 2022, the court issued a preliminary injunction, barring the law from taking effect until appeals were resolved.\nOn January 26, 2023, the League of Women Voters of Utah and 39 business leaders filed an amicus brief supporting Planned Parenthood, arguing the ban violated the Utah Constitution\u2019s guarantees of equal rights for men and women and detailed the harms the new law visited upon women and children.\nThe League is represented in this matter by Linda Faye Smith.\n\n\nLWV Timeline\n\n\n\nMarch 2020\nUtah enacts abortion ban\nThe Utah Legislature enacts a near-total abortion ban, which will come into effect if the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. The law nearly bans abortion completely, allowing exceptions to save the mother\u2019s life, prevent \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment\u201d of a major bodily function, and for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest that are reported to law enforcement.\nAbortion Ban Text\n\n\n\nJune 2022\nUnited States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade\nIn a decision overturning 50 years of precedent, the Supreme Court overrules Roe v. Wade, declaring there is no federal right to abortion and allowing states to impose abortion bans.\nPress Release\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\n\n\nJune 2022\nPlanned Parenthood Utah files complaint\nPlanned Parenthood of Utah sues in state court, arguing the ban violates the rights of Utahans to choose one\u2019s family composition and to parent, equal protection of the laws, uniform operation of the laws, bodily autonomy, freedom from involuntary servitude, conscience, and privacy protected under Utah state law.\nComplaint\n\n\n\nJuly 2022\nCourt issues preliminary injunction\nThe court grants a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff is likely to succeed in proving substantial harm, given the consequences of banning abortion on Planned Parenthood Utah and its patients and staff. Among the harms cited by the court are the costs of traveling outside Utah for abortions, the emotional and physical risk of being forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, and unsafe self-induced abortions.\nOrder Granting Preliminary Injunction\n\n\n\nSeptember 2022\nUtah Supreme Court grants appeal\nThe Utah Supreme Court grants the state\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\n\n\n\nJanuary 2023\nLWV Utah files amicus brief\nLWV Utah, along with 39 other business leaders, file an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs. The brief asserts the ban violates Utah\u2019s protections of equal rights for men and women and will cause significant harm to women and children and hurt Utah\u2019s economy.\nAmicus Brief\n\n\n\nAugust 2023\nUtah supreme court holds oral argument\nThe court holds oral arguments on whether the trial court's decision to enter a preliminary injunction enjoining the abortion ban should be reversed.\nOral Argument Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nContact Us.\n\n\nBlog.\n\n\nNewsroom.\n\n\nCareers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nTik-Tok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 League of Women Voters.
