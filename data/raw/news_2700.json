Sign up for our daily newsletter.\u00a0\nFour years ago, Jennifer Abel broke a lifelong record when she cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton, the first time she voted for a Democrat.\u00a0\n\u201cDonald Trump just doesn\u2019t epitomize any of my value system, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to vote for him,\u201d said Abel, a mother of six who lives in southern Virginia.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years, Abel\u2019s stance on abortion has guided her voting record. She considers herself \u201cpro-life,\u201d she said. But especially now, that identity has taken on a new meaning. Between the president\u2019s stances on immigration, his rhetoric on race and, most recently, his approach to handling the coronavirus, she said, she doesn\u2019t think the Republican Party approaches her definition of valuing life after birth.\u00a0\nSo, Abel \u2014 along with her husband and 18-year-old son \u2014 is voting for Democratic nominee Joe Biden, despite his avowed commitment to maintaining abortion access. And she\u2019s encouraging other women she knows to do the same.\u00a0\n\u201cHow can you call yourself a pro-life president if you refuse to be completely forthcoming about the ways most lives can be protected?\u201d she said. \u201cThe pandemic has really shone a giant spotlight on the hypocrisy of a lot of people who have fallen into that pro-life camp.\u201d\nAbel is the kind of voter Trump is counting on to win, one he has explicitly appealed to in recent rallies: a White suburban woman, a conservative, and a Christian who opposes abortion.\u00a0\nWhite women and White Christian voters\u00a0played a critical role in Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. But polling and focus groups make it clear that the coalition is developing cracks. White women are increasingly abandoning Trump. White Catholics and White mainline Protestants \u2014 groups that both backed Trump in 2016 \u2014 are less likely to support the president than they did four years ago.\u00a0\nAnd abortion has taken a backseat to other health care concerns. The issue ranks as a low priority for most voters, including White Catholics and White Protestants, who are more concerned with COVID-19 and health care, per recent polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). Voters generally favor Biden on both of those issues, separate polling suggests.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

It sounds small, but it\u2019s just enough to make a difference, especially as the president\u2019s support weakens across the board, said Natalie Jackson, PRRI\u2019s research director.\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost pieces of so many different groups that it matters,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one large group that\u2019s turned against Trump. It\u2019s pieces of different groups. It\u2019s pieces of White women, it\u2019s pieces of older Americans.\u201d\nSarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who frequently holds focus groups with undecided women in swing states, says that anti-abortion voters have cited a number of reasons why they will not back the president this year.\u00a0\nSome women cite Trump\u2019s criticism of protesters speaking out against police violence and racial injustice this summer. Others point to the president\u2019s immigration policies, including the notorious stance of separating families at the southern border, which sparked national headlines in 2018 and is back in the news.\u00a0\nAbove all, there is the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 220,000 Americans and disproportionately affected women economically and in terms of mental health consequences.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of people I hear in the focus groups who say \u2026 \u2018I could never vote for a Democrat because I\u2019m pro-life,\u2019\u201d Longwell said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also heard with about equal time from women who consider themselves pro-life, who have always voted Republican because they are pro-life, who are voting for Joe Biden or leaning for Joe Biden this time, for whom race and Donald Trump\u2019s general behavior and divisiveness has become something that has caused them to rethink the frame around what it means to be pro-life.\u201d\nFor Jody Delikat, a 49-year-old evangelical Christian voter in Madison, Wisconsin, the past four years have forced her to go through that reckoning. In 2016, she wrote in a vote for John Kasich, the former Ohio governor who ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign. This year, she\u2019s planning to vote for Biden, even though she is anti-abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cA lot of heart-to-hearts with people I love has helped me understand there is a difference between pro-birth and pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cSeparating children and putting them in cages is not pro-life. Refusing to wear a mask is not pro-life. I really view that stance as really hypocritical \u2014 you can\u2019t say you respect life only for unborn children and disregard other life.\u201d\nTrump has heavily emphasized abortion in the months leading up to the election, flooding the August Republican National Convention with anti-abortion speakers, and, more recently, nominating Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, a move that abortion-access advocates fear could lead to overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade. At Thursday\u2019s final presidential debate, though, Barrett and the topic of abortion in general\u00a0were noticeably absent.\u00a0\nThe president\u2019s emphasis on abortion during his 2016 campaign,\u00a0including promises to appoint Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade, is believed to have played a role in his victory. But the true picture is more complicated,\u00a0which could help explain why recreating that formula is proving a challenge.\nFor one thing, not all of Trump\u2019s female supporters actually opposed abortion rights, Longwell noted \u2014 so emphasizing the issue now does little to win them over. And women interviewed by The 19th, who all said they opposed abortion personally and had, in the past, factored it into their voting patterns, expressed attitudes ranging from skepticism to downright disapproval of the idea of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\u00a0\nThe majority of White women \u2014\u00a0about 59 percent \u2014 say abortion should remain legal in most or all cases, according to PRRI. Polling conducted before and after Barrett\u2019s nomination showed no difference in how voters ranked abortion in shaping their votes.\u00a0\nAt most, a third of the general electorate includes single-issue abortion voters, who say they will only support a candidate who shares their stance on that issue. When you control for other demographic factors, the number drops substantially, Jackson noted \u2014 all patterns suggesting abortion is not driving a large enough voting bloc.\nOpinions on abortion appear less important in determining support for the president than attitudes on immigration, said Ryan Burge, a pastor and a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University who focuses on politics and religion. That appears to have been true in 2016, as well.\u00a0\nWhite evangelical voters in favor of abortion rights but opposed to immigration appear more likely to back the president than those who oppose abortion but support immigration, per his analysis.\u00a0\nAnd Republican women are more likely to disapprove of Trump\u2019s immigration record, he said, which Burge believes could drive more people to vote for Biden this year. Among Republican women who strongly approved of Trump, 53 percent supported family separation, compared to 62 percent of comparable men, per his research. Of those who somewhat approved of Trump, 23.4 percent of Republican women supported the policy, compared to 35.5 percent of Republican men.\u00a0\n\u201cWomen are much more reluctant to separate families,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cuts against them more than abortion.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Trump has spent little campaign time talking about the issue that appears to be affecting even anti-abortion women most: COVID-19.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is part of the overall conversation about why he\u2019s doing so poorly with women in general,\u201d Longwell said. \u201cHe\u2019s not talking about the things that matter to these women. If there\u2019s one thing that matters to them, it\u2019s their lives have been upended by coronavirus.\u201d\nFor Lacine Aday, in Texas, the coronavirus is a key factor in why she is voting for Biden.\u00a0\n\u201cI think Donald Trump could have done a whole lot more to save lives. I do think he has blood on his hands for how he\u2019s handled this,\u201d said Aday, a 43-year-old independent voter from Flower Mound.\u00a0\nAday is active in her church, and opposes abortion, though she doesn\u2019t believe criminalizing it is an effective approach. Her top issues include addressing the pandemic and better gun regulation, especially since she has three school-aged children. Before Trump, she said, she would have identified as an evangelical Christian. But now, she finds the term\u2019s association with the president hard to swallow. She\u2019s not so sure what to call herself anymore.\nAfter Trump\u2019s 2016 election, Aday, who was one of the few Christian women she knew to vote for Clinton, started a private Facebook group for people like her. It began with about 10 women, White Christians in the surrounding community who didn\u2019t support the president.\u00a0\nBut since then, its membership has ballooned. Of the 225 women in the group, Aday estimates that half are lifelong Republicans who cannot bring themselves to vote for Trump this year. Because the group is private, she said, they feel comfortable talking about their change in views \u2014 even though none would express their political shift in public.\u00a0\nAday doesn\u2019t see Texas going for Biden this year. But longer term, she foresees a trend that\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a whole lot more [Democratic] votes than there ever were before,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s creeping in that direction.\u201d\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nLight on the pandemic, RNC speakers instead highlighted Trump\u2019s record on abortion\n\n\n\n\nNew polling shows that health care could shape the final weeks of the election\n\n\n\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Congress codify abortion rights?\n\n\n\n\nA presidential rematch \u2014 this time with abortion at the forefront\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
