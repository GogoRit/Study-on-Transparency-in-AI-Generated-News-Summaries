(Greg Bruce/CBC News)Social Sharing\u200bConservative Party leadership prospect Leslyn Lewis says she wants to see\u00a0all Canadians\u00a0treated with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.Don't expect to see her marching in any Pride parades, though. And she thinks the drive to ban conversion therapy is misguided.\"I didn't march in the parade before I became a politician,\" said the Toronto lawyer, who became eligible to run for the leadership\u00a0late last month. \"And I would feel that it's very disingenuous for me to use a particular vulnerable group to advance my political career.\"Lewis, who runs her own\u00a0law firm and\u00a0has a PhD in law and a\u00a0master's in environmental science, has emerged as the first choice of some social conservatives, including the anti-abortion advocacy group\u00a0Right Now.On\u00a0abortion, Pride parades and conversion therapy \u2014 the highly controversial practice of attempting to change someone's sexual orientation through psychological or spiritual counselling \u2014 she's offside with those in the party calling for an end to divisive debates on hot-button social issues.Watch: Power & Politics' full interview with Conservative leadership contender Leslyn Lewis.FULL INTERVIEW: Leslyn Lewis Power & Politics4 years agoDuration 10:17Vassy Kapelos, host of CBC News Network's Power & Politics interviews Conservative leadership contender Leslyn Lewis.Pride participation a 'personal choice'In fact,\u00a0Lewis told CBC News\u00a0she decided to run for the leadership after watching the way\u00a0Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was treated during the last election\u00a0\u2014 and what she called the Liberals'\u00a0\"obsession\" with Scheer's refusal to attend Pride parades.\"If you are ready to treat every Canadian with equal dignity and respect, it doesn't matter whether or not you march in a parade,\" she said. \"That's a personal choice.\"Lewis' position distinguishes her from\u00a0the perceived front-runners in the race. Peter MacKay and Erin O'Toole\u00a0both have said they would march in Pride parades, although O'Toole said he would skip Toronto's parade because of its policy of excluding uniformed police officers.Today,\u00a0Lewis took a direct shot at MacKay\u00a0on Facebook, accusing him of trying to shut down social conservatives within the party by arguing shortly after last fall's election that Scheer's\u00a0views on social issues were a \"stinking albatross\" hanging around the leader's neck during the campaign.\"Peter MacKay has a message for you: if you're pro-life, you just need to be quiet,\" she wrote.The issue of\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0rights was a flashpoint in the Conservative leadership race\u00a0before it even got properly started. Well before the eligible candidates were confirmed,\u00a0Richard D\u00e9carie, a former chief of staff to Stephen Harper who pitched himself as a candidate,\u00a0made headlines and drew widespread criticism when he said being gay is a choice.Watch: Richard\u00a0D\u00e9carie\u00a0on abortion, LGBTQ\u00a0rightsD\u00e9carie says a lot of Conservatives support his views on abortion & LGBT rights4 years agoDuration 10:09Richard D\u00e9carie says he would push to roll back same-sex marriage & abortion rights if he wins Conservative leadership.Lewis said she thinks D\u00e9carie is wrong.\"When I look at the struggles of some of my gay friends, being estranged from your parents from coming out \u2014\u00a0I wouldn't think that they would choose that themselves,\" she said.\u00a0\"I witnessed the pain that they've gone through.\"D\u00e9carie was later\u00a0barred by the party from running for the leadership. While no official reason was ever given, he has claimed he was blocked because of his views on LGBTQ\u00a0rights. Lewis said she didn't seek\u00a0an endorsement from him.\"I have not communicated with him throughout this entire campaign,\" she said.D\u00e9carie\u00a0has endorsed another social conservative candidate, MP Derek Sloan.Conservative Party bars controversial candidate Richard D\u00e9carie from leadership raceConversion therapy and parental autonomyLewis said she's firmly opposed to the federal government's push to ban conversion therapy\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the\u00a0practice of using psychological or spiritual counselling to attempt to change the sexual orientation of\u00a0someone who identifies as LGBTQ2 to heterosexual.The World Health Organization\u00a0has called the practice\u00a0a \"serious threat to the health and well-being\" of those affected.Lewis said she's hearing from parents and pastors who worry\u00a0that what she calls \"a talk therapy session\" could be criminalized under the proposed law.\"They're concerned that their parental autonomy is being limited because the government is basically somewhat stepped in as surrogate to tell them what they can and cannot do,\" she said.Asked if she thinks children might need protection from conversion therapy in some circumstances, Lewis would only say she thinks it's important to support children who are struggling \u2014 and that may include speaking with their pastors.'No hidden agenda'On abortion, Lewis has told her supporters that she is\u00a0\"pro-life, no hidden agenda.\"If elected party leader, she said, she would move to ban sex-selective abortions, criminalize coercive abortions, increase funding for pregnancy centres that counsel women about their alternatives to ending a pregnancy\u00a0and end funding for international abortions through Canada's foreign aid.Listen: CBC's Party Lines on the Conservative leadership candidatesParty Lines26:33Eight Conservatives enter the ThunderdomeAfter weeks of wondering who's in and who's out, the stage is finally set for the federal Conservative leadership race. Eight contenders will fight it out to become party leader, and by extension, Leader of the Official Opposition -\u2014 a plum job, in a minority parliament. Catherine Cullen, senior reporter for CBC News, sits in for Rosie this week and joins Elamin in running through the list of hopefuls. And as several candidates say they intend to bring down the Liberal government at the first opportunity this fall, Elamin asks \u2014 are the Conservatives more focused on defeating Justin Trudeau than establishing a party vision?The anti-abortion group Right Now is recommending that Conservative Party members rank Lewis first on their ballots, followed by fellow social conservative Sloan. O'Toole \u2014 who has said he will defend the right\u00a0of women to choose but would let MPs vote their conscience on matters like abortion \u2014 is ranked third.Another prominent anti-abortion group, Campaign Life Coalition, has given Lewis\u00a0\"green light\" status to indicate she is a candidate worthy of support.No carbon tax, not committing to Paris targetsLewis said having\u00a0a master's in environmental science gives her a unique angle on how the environment is interwoven into different aspects of the economy.She's written papers about attracting green energy investments to sub-Sarahan Africa\u00a0and has written that\u00a0\"the existential debate over climate change seems to be settled.\"But Lewis is still non-committal about Canada meeting the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets set out in the Paris accord.\"I think that we need to set our own goals,\" she said.\u00a0\"If the Paris targets are constricting our national growth and national autonomy, maybe we don't aim for that. Or maybe we aim to go higher than that. So, I think, we just have to set our own standards and do the best we can and realize we live in a global environment.\"She's coy about the details of her own environmental plan, but promises she has one coming.\u00a0But she is clear about what won't be in it.\"We're going to abolish the carbon tax,\" she said.
