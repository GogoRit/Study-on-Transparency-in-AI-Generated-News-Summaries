Wade, ending nearly 50 years of federal protection for abortion, some states began enforcing strict abortion bans while others became new havens for the procedure.

An estimated 23 million Americans live in states that tightly restrict access to abortion. A few states, such as Tennessee, outlaw the procedure with no exceptions, forcing doctors to choose between risking their freedom and saving a pregnant patient\u2019s life.\n\n\n\nSince the Dobbs ruling on June 24, ProPublica has chronicled the nationwide fallout. Our stories have explored new concerns about data privacy, battle lines between blue and red states and the increasing popularity of civil lawsuits that seek to punish people for obtaining abortions.\nA recent investigation by reporter Kavitha Surana explored the complicated story of a Tennessee woman who faced a life-threatening pregnancy after doctors decided they couldn\u2019t risk prosecution to provide an abortion. ProPublica has also explored the harm created by parental involvement laws, on the books in many states long before the Dobbs ruling.\nIn a series of live events, ProPublica has also interviewed the nation\u2019s top legal and medical experts about what they are seeing on the ground following the Dobbs ruling and what they expect going forward.\nLast week, ProPublica talked to two leading experts on how the battle over abortion is impacting people in the most restrictive states and how legal challenges are likely to play out across the country. More than 1,400 people signed up to hear our live discussion with law professor Mary Ziegler and Tennessee OB-GYN Dr. Nikki Zite.\nZiegler is the Martin Luther King Jr. professor of law at the University of California, Davis School of Law. She is one of the world\u2019s leading historians of the U.S. abortion debate and the author of six books on the law, history and politics of reproduction in the United States. Zite lives in Tennessee and is professor and vice chair of education and advocacy in the department of OB-GYN at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine.\nZiegler and Zite presented their personal perspectives on this issue during our discussion, and their thoughts do not reflect the positions of their institutions. This interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\n    Wyoming recently became the latest state to outlaw medication abortion. How do you see the criminal legal landscape playing out?\n\nZiegler: We\u2019ve seen a rising trend within the anti-abortion movement of people who identify themselves as abolitionists. And they essentially argue that if the movement is serious that a fetus or an unborn child is a rights-holding person, then it would be logical to punish women too. The most recent manifestation that people may have heard about was in South Carolina. There were over 20 lawmakers sponsoring a bill that would treat abortion as murder and potentially subject women to the death penalty for having abortions. So far, the mainstream consensus within the anti-abortion movement that punishing women is a bad idea politically and morally is holding up, but it\u2019s fragile.\n\n    We have the wrongful death lawsuit in Texas, in which a man is suing three women for allegedly helping his now-ex-wife obtain an abortion. Nikki, could you tell us about your experience in Tennessee?\n\nZite: The way our law is written, ending any pregnancy is illegal. Immediately, several of our outpatient abortion clinics closed. That not only had the effect of making abortion more challenging to access for people who needed that care, but it also made it harder for those of us who teach abortion to the next generation of OB-GYNs. Then we had all the unintended consequences: the cases like ectopic pregnancy, the cases of inevitable but not complete miscarriage, the cases of that ambiguous \u201cHow close to death does she need to be for it to meet the standards of protecting or saving her life?\u201d It became this complicated legal situation where physicians not only felt like they had to make medical decisions, they then had to run it by hospital legal or a criminal attorney. We\u2019ve lost a lot of physicians, and we don\u2019t know whether or not medical students will want to train in states where they\u2019re going to have restrictions on the type of care that they can learn.\n\n\nWatch the Full Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    I guess you\u2019d call it a brain drain of doctors in this field who are leaving states like Wyoming?\n\nZite: There\u2019s only a couple of OB-GYNs in some of those states. So if they leave, you really have these OB deserts.\n\n    Mary, you\u2019ve mentioned fetal personhood laws. Does establishing fetal personhood make a pregnant person who has an abortion a murderer under the law?\n\nZiegler: There are proposals emerging on the right that we need to make birth free [of charge]. Georgia has its anti-abortion law requiring certain forms of child support during pregnancy. Then on the other hand, you have people saying if equal treatment is really the name of the game, then that requires murder prosecutions for people who have abortions.\n\n\n\nSo far it\u2019s mostly been emerging in state legislators up to a point. We\u2019ve seen it in the wrongful death lawsuit you mentioned. One question you might have is: Why bother with a wrongful death lawsuit? They wanted to say that if you provide someone else with abortion pills, you\u2019re an accomplice to murder or you are a murderer, and that\u2019s a personhood argument. We\u2019re going to see it crop up more, and eventually the end game is a case brought to the U.S. Supreme Court. Whether they lead to prosecutions of women or just to nationwide abortion bans remains to be seen.\n\n    Nikki, you\u2019ve been part of working on a bill to modify Tennessee\u2019s law to create clear exceptions for maternal health care. Can you tell us about that effort and where it stands now?\n\nZite: Not in a good place. We were sticking with the things we could all agree on. The amendment passed 8 to 2 out of committee. Immediately, the right-to-life got all their members to call legislators and started threatening the legislators with losing their \u201cranking.\u201d Unfortunately, we now have a very watered-down amendment. I don\u2019t think that physicians are going to feel that it gives them much more leeway to provide lifesaving care without being criminalized.\n\n    What are the problems with policymakers trying to determine what constitutes a medical emergency?\n\nZite: The idea that it has to be a medical emergency is the first problem. We should be able to prevent an emergency, not just treat an emergency. The overwhelming evidence for most of these cases is that it doesn\u2019t improve the outcome for the pregnancy to wait. That\u2019s why laws for abortion have been liberalized in places like Poland, South and Central America and Ireland. Women died because they were made to stay pregnant until there was no longer a heartbeat and they got infected or bled. We don\u2019t want to go back to that in the United States. Legislators don\u2019t seem to understand that\u2019s the inevitable outcome of what they\u2019re forcing us to do.\n\n    I have had a question about that as a journalist. How are we going to know whether more people are dying or suffering measurable harm in states that have banned abortion?\n\nZite: And how long is it going to take us to get that data? When we look at the state and maternal mortality reports, they\u2019re not always that accurate, and these reviews usually were two or three years behind.\n\n    Mary, you recently wrote that the court does not get the final word even on the meaning of its own important decisions. Can you talk about that?\n\nZiegler: I think what we saw with Roe, the judges pretty clearly thought that they were settling this and that Roe was going to mean abortion was a thing between a doctor and a woman. I think the court in Dobbs is trying to say the same thing: that history and tradition, in the court\u2019s view, would not have recognized the right to abortion in the 19th century, and that\u2019s the end of it. We\u2019re already seeing Dobbs emerging as a symbol of things the Supreme Court didn\u2019t want it to be. We\u2019ve seen a lot of poll data documenting a really precipitous decline in trust of the Supreme Court and Dobbs being the most visible symbol of that decline. I think the court often holds itself out as having the last word on these constitutional struggles when it can\u2019t.\n\n    One of our readers asks: What can people who live in states that still protect abortion rights do to safeguard maternal health for themselves and others in states that ban abortion?\n\nZite: I\u2019m feeling pretty discouraged, frankly. I think it\u2019s going to take ballot initiatives. We don\u2019t have that option in Tennessee, but there are other states that do. Normally you say state elections are important, but when they\u2019ve been gerrymandered so much, I don\u2019t see things getting better in Tennessee for decades. I\u2019m focusing at a federal level.\nZiegler: Based on what\u2019s going on now in the federal courts, if you\u2019re living in a state where abortion is legal, you should not take for granted that that will remain the case. The mifepristone case we\u2019d been talking about in Texas could, depending on how the FDA responds, make it impossible for people in a state like California to have a medication abortion. We\u2019ve seen some voices emerging essentially saying, \u201cLook, even if you define yourself as pro-life, do you really want to spend a lot of taxpayer money enforcing criminal abortion laws?\u201d\n\n    There\u2019s a notion that medical exceptions to abortion bans give people appropriate access to the medical care they need. Nikki, can you talk about that a little bit?\n\nZite: I think that a lot of people think, well, if we add an exception, that\u2019s going to get access for some. But access for some is not actually helping the majority. The type of care I provide in a hospital setting is less than 1% of abortion care. Without abortion care, we\u2019re going to see maternal mortality go up. We\u2019re going to see people stay in abusive relationships.\n\n    Dr. Zite, how are medical schools deciding what procedures are taught, and what is their legal standing?\n\nZite: Currently about half of the residency training programs are in banned states. It is a requirement to graduate from a residency and become a board-certified OB-GYN to be able to perform abortion care. We\u2019ve been struggling in Tennessee to figure out how we\u2019re going to get that training for our residents. Will it actually make it harder to become board-certified?\n\n    So you have some doctors leaving these states, training that is difficult to access and people who will be coming to emergency rooms needing abortion care in an emergency?\n\nZite: That\u2019s the situation that I think is very poorly understood. I had a resident when I first got to the University of Tennessee that had opted out of all abortion training before I arrived. About three months before she finished training, we were called down to the trauma bay and a young woman who was about 16 weeks pregnant had been in a very bad car accident. There was still a fetal heartbeat. We did the case together, and afterward the resident had this moment of realizing \u201cI\u2019m going to be on my own in three months.\u201d What happens if this patient comes into my ER? I am the person who should be able to save her life. We need to be able to train doctors to do these procedures.\n\n\nAre You in a State That Banned Abortion?
