(photo: Photo by Maria Oswalt on Unsplash)\n\n\nTom Hoopes\nCommentaries\nSeptember 30, 2020\n\n\nI wanted to write about what the Black Lives Matters movement can learn from the pro-life movement\u2019s positive approach, preaching compassion and change instead of anger and division.\u00a0\nBut then Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and I remembered just how hard it is to be positive in the face of cruelty.\nI wish pro-lifers like me could see Ginsburg the way her friend, pro-life Justice Antonin Scalia, did \u2014 as a whole person, worthy of respect and friendship. But most of us just sum her up in one hyphenated word: \u201cpro-abortion.\u201d President Trump, upon hearing of her death, said, \u201cwhether you agree or not, she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life.\u201d\nI wish I could praise her life like that. I can\u2019t. When I try, the voices of her unborn victims rise in anger \u2014 the millions who should be our friends, our children\u2019s friends, working in our communities, researching in our labs, singing and laughing and loving, creating a better future for the world \u2014 voices that were snuffed out for profit because of her life\u2019s work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I realize that this is exactly how those in the Black Lives Matter movement feel. The difference is they don\u2019t have to imagine the victims of the oppression they are fighting. They have met them: children rejected as friends and overlooked in their classrooms, young people treated with suspicion and denied opportunities, people who should be creating a better future for the world, but who have been stopped by what MLK\u2019s friend Father Charles O. Rice called \u201cthe horrible normalness and ghastly ubiquity of racial prejudice in the United States.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat We Have in Common\nThe fact is: The anti-racist movement and the anti-abortion movement both face entrenched opponents who are convinced of their own innocence even as they perpetuate evil.\u00a0\nTo try to understand anti-racism better I have been reading books by Ibram Kendi, Ta-Nehisi Coates and Robin Diangelo. These authors are tired of hearing people protest that they are \u201cnot racist.\u201d The way they see it \u2014 and they\u2019re right \u2014 life in America is harder for Black people not because Americans embrace an explicitly racist creed, but because of unspoken racist assumptions.\nPro-lifers know how this works. Abortion is practiced from conception to just before (and just after) birth \u2014 but people don\u2019t want to believe that, so they don\u2019t. Pro-abortionists have changed the very terms of debate, turning the killing of children into \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201d Public schools, universities and the media are so pro-abortion that they reflexively cover up what abortion does to unborn children and women, carefully projecting a sunny lie that benefits the abortion industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know exactly what Kendi is talking about in How to Be an Antiracist when he complains about how race is discussed. We can match him term for term. He says people say they are \u201crace neutral\u201d even as they benefit from and perpetuate racial inequities. We hear people say, \u201cI\u2019m not pro-abortion\u201d even as they direct money to the abortion industry with their votes. He winces when people say they are \u201ccolor blind\u201d to avoid challenging themselves. We wince when people say they are \u201cpro-choice\u201d and avoid mentioning what choice they are talking about.\nAnti-racists are tired of the dehumanization of race victims. As Coates powerfully put it in Between the World and Me: \u201cSlavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific enslaved woman, whose mind is as active as your own, whose range of feeling is as vast as your own; who prefers the way the light falls in one particular spot in the woods, who enjoys fishing where the water eddies in a nearby stream, who loves her mother in her own complicated way, thinks her sister talks too loud, has a favorite cousin, a favorite season, who excels at dressmaking and knows, inside herself, that she is as intelligent and capable as anyone.\u201d\nDon\u2019t call them \u201cslaves\u201d \u2014 call them \u201censlaved people,\u201d he says. Pro-lifers agree.\u00a0\nWe are tired of unborn children being called \u201cproducts of conception,\u201d \u201cembryos\u201d or \u201cfetuses.\u201d Call them unborn children. At the earliest stage, an embryo is already a human being with her own set of DNA, sex and life expectancy. Then as she develops in the womb, she hears songs, suffers pain and starts to learn. She has a face, fingernails and feelings. When she is painfully burned, ripped to shreds or cut to pieces in the womb it isn\u2019t \u201cthe termination of a pregnancy.\u201d It\u2019s the execution of an innocent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-racists are tired of the racial hypocrisy of Americans. In Stamped From the Beginning, Kendi traces that hypocrisy and is particularly incensed by Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did it mean for Jefferson to call \u2018liberty\u2019 an \u2018inalienable right\u2019 when he enslaved people?\u201d he asks. Pro-lifers agree \u2014 and wonder why \u201cpro-choicers\u201d think they have any more integrity than Jefferson when they deny the inalienable right to life to the unborn.\n\u00a0\nOur Differences\nWhich brings us to the differences between anti-racists and anti-abortionists. For one, we believe the principles of the Declaration of Independence, hypocritical or not, eventually ended slavery and will one day end abortion.\nAnother difference: The Black Lives Matter movement is embraced by public schools, corporations and the media. The anti-racist authors I read are on television all the time \u2014 on CNN, MSNBC, Good Morning America and Colbert. When was the last time you saw Lila Rose, Abby Johnson or Serrin Foster on those shows? How about Robbie George, Richard Doerflinger or Helen Alvar\u00e9?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that a pro-lifer at The Atlantic got fired for ironically mentioning capital punishment for those guilty of abortion. Coates says violence is necessary to combat racist policies, and The Atlantic keeps him on.\nAnother difference: Anti-racist authors universalize their concerns such that they encompass everything.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy,\u201d wrote Kendi. \u201cEvery policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequality or equity between racial groups.\u201d\u00a0\nRacism taints everything in his telling \u2014 including the very system of capitalism. That\u2019s why the Black Lives Matter organization embraces Marxism and (at first) proudly proclaimed its opposition to \u201cheteronormative thinking\u201d and its commitment to \u201cdisrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wholesale rejection of every aspect of society is a tough sell. It is hard to get someone to admit that they are radically wrong about everything \u2014 because they know very well that they aren\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s another difference. Pro-lifers think our basic position \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t kill infants\u201d \u2014 is common sense. But Kendi says, \u201cTo be an antiracist is a radical choice in the face of this history, requiring a radical reorientation of our consciousness.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBreaking Out of Bubbles\nThat kind of statement only comes from inside a bubble. The less you expose your positions to discussion and correction, the more radical they become.\nPro-lifers have our own bubble problems. It\u2019s a problem that we can\u2019t praise Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 or Barack Obama. To most Americans, Obama is \u201cthe first black president in history.\u201d To pro-lifers, he\u2019s \u201cthe most pro-abortion president in history.\u201d This way of talking makes us look judgmental and small and hurts our cause.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Kendi calls even Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson \u201cinarguably racist\u201d and characterizes \u201cboth religious-freedom laws and voter-ID laws in Republican states as taking away the rights of queer people.\u201d Dismissing his opponents might play well in the bubble, but it will never allow him to persuade those of us outside it.\nYou can see an unwillingness to leave his bubble when Coates compares anti-racism and pro-life movements in The Atlantic.\u00a0\n\u201cThe biological theories about black people \u2026 were defeated because they were bad science,\u201d he says. But he can\u2019t bring himself to use the same standard. \u201cThere is a tangible scientific answer to the question of whether blacks are homo sapiens. Is there really a scientific answer to whether life begins at conception?\u201d\u00a0\nUm \u2014 yes. Exactly the same DNA science that shows his humanity and mine shows the humanity of the unborn.\n\u00a0\nOutside Your Bubble, Violence Backfires\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first things you learn when you engage with the wider world is that violence is never persuasive, no matter how powerfully your logic compels you to use it.\nPro-lifers long ago have faced this argument: \u201cIf there were a death camp in our neighborhood, wouldn\u2019t it be our duty to stop the killing, using any means necessary? So shouldn\u2019t we destroy abortion businesses?\u201d\nOur answer: You can\u2019t defeat abortion without changing hearts, and violence only hardens people\u2019s prejudices about our cause. Destruction has failed pro-lifers whenever it has been tried. Instead, we spent our time serving unwed mothers, and opinions started to change.\nWe pray the Black Lives Matter movement will learn the same lesson soon. But that brings us to another difference between the anti-abortion and anti-racism movements.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOur leaders decry any and all violence and distance themselves from it immediately. But Kendi and Coates have both defended rioting. This is tragic. Too much is at stake. Take it from a pro-life friend: That has to change, or you will get nowhere.\nNext: The Church Does Anti-Racism Right\nTom Hoopes is writer in residence at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas.\n\n\nKeywords: \nblack lives matter\npro-life groups\npro-life\nanti-racism\nanti-abortion\ntom hoopes\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe March and Fight Under the Banner of Jesus Christ\n\nFlags matter.
