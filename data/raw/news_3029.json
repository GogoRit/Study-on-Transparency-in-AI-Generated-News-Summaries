The survey, which was posed to 1,805 respondents, found that the majority of Canadians surveyed are unabashedly pro-choice, with a miniscule portion of the nation holding wholly pro-life views. Furthermore, even those who consider their faith to play an important role in their life are unlikely to follow pro-life ideals.\u00a0Majority pro-choiceAccording to the data, just over half of Canadians (52%) consider themselves \u201ccompletely pro-choice,\u201d while the portion of those who consider themselves \u201ccompletely pro-life\u201d makes up just 8% of respondents. The remaining 41% say they are somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum. It should be noted that the figures were rounded up to the nearest percentage point, which is why these numbers add up to 101%.\u00a0Those who fall within the \u201cin between\u201d group have varying opinions on how far into a pregnancy abortion should be allowed. Over a third (36%) said that they were comfortable allowing abortions to be performed up to 15 weeks into the pregnancy. Nearly a quarter, however, said abortion should be allowed until fetal viability, between 23 and 24 weeks. Meanwhile, a solid third (33%) said they were unsure.\u00a0Faith no guaranteeWile faith was found to be a factor, a strong faith is no guarantee of pro-life views among Canadians. Of those who said their faith was an important factor in their lives, only 40% said they were \u201ccompletely pro-life.\u201d This group was nearly as likely (39%) to say that they were somewhere between the two stances. Over a fifth (21%) of respondents who place importance on faith consider themselves \u201ccompletely pro-choice.\u201d\u00a0Respondents were asked to consider the rights of the unborn, especially those which have reached the fetal viability stage. Nearly three-fifths (58%) said that the mother\u2019s rights should supersede those of the viable fetus. Only 22% responded that the rights of a viable fetus should be equal to those of the mothers. This latter response was more commonly held by men, but all demographics leaned towards rights of the woman taking precedence.\u00a0The Angus Reid Institute noted that this is the second of a three part survey. The previous iteration focused on Canadians\u2019 personal experiences with abortion; whether they had one or carried an unwanted pregnancy to term. The third survey will ask Canadians their opinions of abortion laws and whether the nation needs more guarantees or restrictions to abortion.Read more:Survey: Most Catholics don\u2019t want Church to change with the timesRead more:Survey: Many Catholics want to share faith, but need tools and trainingTags:AbortionCanadaMedicinePro-lifeSupport Aleteia!Enjoying your time on Aleteia?\nArticles like these are sponsored free for every Catholic through the support of generous readers just like you.\nThanks to their partnership in our mission, we reach\u00a0more than 20 million unique users per month!\nHelp us continue to bring the Gospel to people everywhere through uplifting and transformative Catholic news, stories, spirituality, and more.\nSupport Aleteia with a gift today!\nDonate now!Daily prayerAnd today we celebrate...Prayer for this morningDaily meditationPrayer for this eveningTop 10See MoreNewsletterGet Aleteia delivered to your inbox.
