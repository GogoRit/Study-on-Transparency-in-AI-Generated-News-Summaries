It was seeing young girls in her community in rural Rukum District being forced into marriage \u2013 including among her own family and friends \u2013 that spurred her into action. She initiated different campaigns to build support against child marriage, including teaching girls self-defense skills, raising awareness among parents about the harms of early marriage, and helping connect victims of child marriage to legal authorities.\u00a0\nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nSocial acceptance of child marriage, and lack of awareness among girls about their own rights. Girls are forced to drop out of school to get married at an age when they are not physically or mentally ready.\nWhat are you doing to end violence against women?\nI have been running a number of campaigns to inform children and families in different parts of Rukum about gender equality, reproductive health and the need to end child marriage. I also make documentaries related to child marriage (you can watch her short film here).\nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nAt 15, I wanted to make a difference in my community, but it was hard to take the first step. But today, I\u2019m glad I went for it. I want girls to know they can do anything they want \u2013 sometimes, you have to jump in the water and learn how to swim later.\n\n\n \nAt 15, I wanted to make a difference in my community, but it was hard to take the first step.

She became a member of Robots Mali when she was only 10. In 2018, they won competitions in Senegal. Her dream is to create her own company, developing IT applications, building robots and following her passion: coding. She actively promotes women in STEM in Mali.\nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nMany girls are out of school. In addition to the poverty of some families who can\u2019t afford to send them to school, many people believe that girls belong at home and not in school.\nWhat are you doing to break stereotypes and support other girls?\nIn our robotics team, we\u2019re trying to bring in more and more girls, not only to encourage them to pursue science but also to prove that in Mali, girls\u2019 participation in science no longer needs to be demonstrated.\nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bGirls and women should be more interested in science to break stereotypes!\n\n\n \nIn our robotics team, we\u2019re trying to bring in more and more girls, not only to encourage them to pursue science but also to prove that in Mali, girls\u2019 participation in science no longer needs to be demonstrated\n\n\n \n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit\nUNICEF/Afghanistan/2020/Sami Malik  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nNazifa, 21, Afghanistan\u00a0\nNazifa, the captain of the cricket team representing the Herat Women Cricket Club, is an inspiration for young Afghan women who are interested in sports. She believes that healthy physical activity is imperative for the overall development of a woman\u2019s personality. Though all sporting activities for women in the country are confined to indoors, she hopes that one day, Afghanistan would have its national women\u2019s cricket team that would compete internationally.\nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nThe lack of access to education and \u00a0other social\u00a0services. For example, there are few girls only schools and few female teachers.\nWhat are you doing to support women?\nI conduct awareness sessions and campaigns through communities and religious leaders on violence against women and girls.\nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nGirls should be more active in social activities and have self-esteem and be self-confident. And as much as possible use their talent to unleash their potential.\n\n\n \n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit\nUNICEF Afghanistan - Omid Fazel\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRubaba, 19, Afghanistan\u00a0\nRubaba was born partially paralyzed. Confined to a corner of her house and denied an education, she suffered for years before deciding to turn her disability into an opportunity. About five years ago, Rubaba started to paint holding the brush between her teeth. She has now held several exhibitions in Afghanistan and\u00a0represented her country internationally. She founded the Rubaba Centre for Art and Culture, where students learn creative and performing arts. \nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nGirls in Afghanistan face numerous challenges, including\u00a0violence, discrimination, harassment. There is also a gender imbalance at the\u00a0workplace, as girls are not accepted as the drivers of progress and change.\nWhat are you doing to support women?\nI have started to give painting lessons to girls, including those with disabilities. It helps them cope with stress, anxiety and often very grim and violent situation at home. Gradually, girls are assuming an active role in the society and that will help improve the gender imbalance. \nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nDon\u2019t give up! If I can change my fate with determination, hard work and following my dreams, so can they. \n\n\n \n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit\nUNICEF Togo Piment Prod\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMijiyawa Rahile, 22, Togo\nShe's an activist on issues of gender, development and leadership of girls from Togo.\u00a0She is also a founding member of the Girls\u2019 Motion movement, campaigning for gender equality through training, awareness raising, and campaigns on sexual and reproductive health. She works as the treasurer of the association Lifestyle International and as a volunteer in the Women and Development Action Group (GF2D).\nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nOne of the main challenges the young girls of my community are facing, is access to information related to reproductive health.\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhat are you doing to support women?\nIn order to break down the stereotypes, I do two main things:\u00a0first, I become an activist in women's rights organizations, and then, I train myself to be a leader or role model in the community.\nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nThey need to arm themselves with knowledge so that in a discussion, they can show the merits of their fight.\n\n\n \nTo girls who want to start advocating for women's rights, I would tell them congratulations and well done! They need to arm themselves with knowledge so that in a discussion, they can show the merits of their fight.\n\n\n \n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit\nUNICEF/Afghanistan/2020/Sami Malik  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nSomaya, 16, Afghanistan\nSomaya is the captain of \u2018Afghan Dreamers\u2019 robotics team which comprises of 25 young women interested in creating mechanical robots. Somaya and her team built\u00a0a robot for detecting landmines, that have caused numerous children and adults lose their limbs and lives in the 40 years of conflict. She'd like to become a role model for young Afghan girls who wish to pursue academic achievements and careers in science and technology.\nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nThe lack of girl sensitive facilities to allow more girls to access services and participate in issues that concern them.\nWhat are you doing to support women?\nI contribute to raise awareness, among men and women, on gender equality and girls\u2019 rights.\nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nAs girls, we must continue to share our success stories with other girls, families and governments through different communication channels. This is empowering to many other girls out there.\n\n\n \n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit\nUNICEF/Afghanistan/2020/Sami Malik  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAziza, 19, Afghanistan\nAziza is the Head of Multi-purpose Adolescents Group (MAG) in Seia Layak community, Bamyan. She helps adolescents to enhance their creative abilities through art,\u00a0playing in important role in raising awareness on discrimination between boys and girls. She also visits families that do not allow their girls to go to school and convinces them to let girls be educated. Due to her efforts, a number of families are now sending their daughters to school and there has been a positive change in the thought process towards girls\u2019 education. \nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nThere is high level of illiteracy among our parents, and because of this they do not realise the value of education, especially for girls. Their illiteracy is the main barrier in promoting, supporting and appreciating the importance of girls\u2019 education.\nWhat are you doing to support women?\nAs a member of the Multi-purpose Adolescent Group in my community, I actively raise awareness about the rights of girls and women. \nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nAlways strive for the best and be confident in themselves. Amidst the challenges that Afghanistan faces, there is still hope and that hope is in young people.\n\n\n \n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit\nUNICEF/Afghanistan/2020/Sami Malik  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nSafia, 16, Afghanistan\nSafia\u00a0conducts a Literacy Class for community women who had never been to school. This is helping illiterate women to learn how to write their names and do simple mathematics. She is also playing an important role in enhancing the awareness level of the communities on social issues such as gender, child rights, negative impact of child marriage, personal and environmental health and hygiene, and the importance of education, particularly for girls.\nWhat are the main challenges for girls in your country or community today?\nThe lack of access to education, especially tertiary education. Most parents do not allow girls to relocate to another city or province to study. This kills the dream of most of the adolescent girls.\nWhat are you doing to support women?\nAs a member of the Multi-purpose Adolescent Group. I am actively working with my colleagues to urge community elders and religious leaders to propagate messages o non-violence against women. In addition, I also raise awareness about the rights of girls and women. \nWhat advice would you give to other girls who want to start advocating for women\u2019s rights?\nGirls should take up an active role in shaping the society to be as they want it. \n\n\n \nMost parents do not permit girls to relocate to another city or province to pursue their education. This kills the dream of most of the adolescent girls.\n\n\n \nTo learn more about gender equality, visit UNICEF.org\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nequality\ngender equality\ngirls empowerment\nWomen\nWomen\u2019s Day\n\n\n\nTopic\nHuman Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\nJoin the discussion on social media\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ureportglobal\nhttps://facebook.com/ureport\nhttps://instagram.com/ureport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\nLEGAL\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC 2019\u00a0Voices of Youth.
