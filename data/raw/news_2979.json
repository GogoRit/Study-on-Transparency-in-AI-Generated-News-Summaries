Wade mean?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Kansas woman allegedly attacked a teenage pro-life canvasser when the student knocked on her door Sunday.\nThe student, Grace Hartsock, was going door-to-door to\u00a0turn out Kansas voters\u00a0for a Tuesday referendum on abortion law. The incident occurred when she approached a home in Leawood, according to Students for Life, the organization with which Hartsock was volunteering.\nHartsock says a woman answered the door and politely stated she was not interested when she learned why Hartsock had knocked.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think you want to talk to us,\u201d the woman said.\n\nHartsock turned to leave when another voice, also a woman, came from farther inside the house yelling and cursing.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to her, mom,\u201d the woman yelled, according to SFL.\nThe second woman, whose identity is unknown, then reportedly followed Hartsock out of the house while berating her. SFL says the woman shoved Hartsock in the chest and began striking her head with closed fists.\nHartsock weathered the blows until the woman\u2019s mother got the daughter to stop. The woman continued yelling, however, telling Hartsock, \u201cI hope you get raped,\u201d and \u201cI hope you get run over by a car,\u201d SFL says.\n\n\n\nThe student, Grace Hartsock, was canvassing door-to-door to\u00a0turn out Kansas voters\u00a0for a referendum on abortion law.  studentsforlifeaction/Facebook\nThe teenager was able to capture the final moments of the encounter with her phone, showing the woman back away toward the house while still hurling expletives.\nSFL says Hartsock has filed a complaint to the Leewood Police Department regarding the incident. Hartsock declined an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\u201cSince she was struck, the student is experiencing headaches and body soreness, and Students for Life Action has connected her with an attorney. She and Students for Life Action are considering a legal response.\u201d SFL spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick told Fox.\nKansas residents\u00a0are voting on an amendment\u00a0to the state constitution that would allow state lawmakers to regulate abortion access. The state will be the first in the country to hold a vote on abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June.\n\n\n\nGrace Hartsock was able to capture the final moments of the confrontation. studentsforlifeaction/Facebook\nThe \u201cValue Them Both\u201d amendment would \u201caffirm there is no Kansas constitutional right to abortion or to require the government funding of abortion, and would reserve to the people of Kansas, through their elected state legislators, the right to pass laws to regulate abortion, including, but not limited to, in circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or when necessary to save the life of the mother.\u201d\n\nThe referendum comes roughly three years after the state Supreme Court ruled that the Kansas constitution\u00a0protects the right to an abortion\u00a0in 2019.\nKansas is a heavily Republican state, and the legislature would be likely to pass restrictions on abortion soon after the referendum if the amendment succeeds. It was the GOP supermajority in the state legislature that ensured the referendum would happen following the 2019 ruling and the fall of Roe.\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\nabortion\n\n\nkansas\n\n\nRoe v.
