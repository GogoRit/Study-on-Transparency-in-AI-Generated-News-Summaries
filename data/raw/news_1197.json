John Bel Edwards, an anti-abortion Democrat, said he believes more funding should go toward support services for pregnant people, infants and children if a state abortion law takes effect later this year, though his top health and child welfare advocates haven\u2019t discussed specific proposals yet.\u00a0\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s incumbent on us to do that,\u201d Edwards said last Wednesday. \u201cI think we should do it regardless [of whether an abortion ban takes place].\u201d\u00a0\nAnti-abortion Republican lawmakers who oversee the budget process in the Louisiana Legislature were more circumspect.\u00a0\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Bodi White, R-Baton Rouge, said he hadn\u2019t considered whether services for women and children should receive more money because of a possible abortion ban, though he is expected to unveil the Senate leadership\u2019s budget proposal Friday. \nHouse Appropriations Chairman Committee Jerome Zeringue, R-Houma, who controls the budget process in the House, said money could be moved around if necessary, after the U.S. Supreme Court decision is finalized that could allow Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban to take effect.\u00a0\nThe Legislature\u2019s most powerful lawmaker, Senate President Page Cortez, R-Lafayette, said he wasn\u2019t willing to shift funding into programs for maternal health or children based on a Supreme Court ruling that hasn\u2019t been issued yet. \n\nA draft opinion from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito released last week indicates that the court will overturn Roe v. Wade, which requires access to abortion all states. A final decision is expected until June.\u00a0\n\u201cA leaked interoffice memo is not a court decision,\u201d Cortez said.\nIf Roe falls, Louisiana will immediately prohibit almost all abortion under a state law passed in 2006. It would allow for abortion only in cases where the pregnant patient\u2019s life is at risk or the pregnancy might cause injury to a patient\u2019s life-sustaining organ.\u00a0\nSuch a ban would be expected to result in a rise in Louisiana births, though it\u2019s unclear how significant the impact will be.\u00a0\nLouisiana recorded 7,444 abortions in 2021, according to figures the Louisiana Department of Health provided. It includes abortions performed on people from other states. Louisiana\u2019s abortion clinic in Shreveport, for example, saw an influx of Texas residents after abortion restrictions tightened in that state earlier this year.\nNo state funding in Louisiana goes toward supporting abortions, but several publicly-funded health care and child welfare programs could see an influx in demand if abortion is no longer on the table. \n \n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid likely to grow, foster care uncertain\nAssuming an abortion ban results in more pregnant Louisiana residents, it will almost certainly cause the state\u2019s Medicaid budget to rise. The Medicaid program is funded with a combination of state and federal tax dollars and already pays for more than 60% of births in Louisiana. \n\nPeople who would normally make too much money to qualify for Medicaid can get access to the program when they become pregnant. The income threshold for joining Medicaid for a pregnant person is twice as high as it is for an able-bodied adult \u2013 about $4,949 per month for a family of four. Louisiana also automatically pays companies that provide Medicaid health plans thousands of dollars more when one of their existing Medicaid recipients becomes pregnant.\u00a0\nLouisiana also will let pregnant people stay in the Medicaid program for far longer in the next state budget cycle, starting July 1. Currently, people are kicked off Medicaid two months after they deliver, but Louisiana has enrolled in a federal program that will expand that coverage to 12 months.\u00a0\nMedicaid also provides coverage for children in \u00a0households that make up to $5,897 per month for a family of four. Those families also have access to a food assistance program that helps people who are pregnant and with young children purchase formula and nutritional food. The programs are almost entirely federally funded.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data is going to say we are going to see more babies, not less. So we have to find a way to add resources.\n\n\n\u2013 Rep. Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge\n\n\nTo the extent that an abortion ban means more Louisiana residents are giving birth and taking care of more children, it would likely increase the statewide cost of all of these benefits. Medicaid is an entitlement program, meaning Louisiana has to help the federal government cover the cost regardless of how it impacts the state\u2019s other budget priorities.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s less clear is whether an abortion ban will have an impact on the state foster care program.\n\u201cIt may very well be that we have more kids come into custody,\u201d said Marketa Walters, secretary of the Department of Children and Family Services.\nWalters\u2019 agency is already struggling to respond to child welfare calls because of a lack of staff. An abortion ban could result in more activity in Louisiana\u2019s Safe Haven program, for example, which gives new parents the option to leave newborns at designated facilities in lieu of abandonment. \n\nSince Safe Haven was implemented in 2004, 83 infants have been turned over to the government, primarily through hospitals and fire stations. Walters said these babies enter the foster care system, but they are typically easy to place with families.\n\n Women legislators might push for funding\u00a0\u00a0\nIf funding for other types of services materializes, it might be because of a push from women legislators.\nWhile the male lawmakers who oversee the budget process weren\u2019t sure if programs for parents and children should receive a funding boost, several anti-abortion women lawmakers interviewed said an abortion ban would create an urgent need for an expansion of support services for pregnant women and young mothers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a need for more resources, but [the draft Supreme Court opinion] puts kind of an exclamation point on it,\u201d said Sen. Sharon Hewitt, R-Slidell.\u00a0\n\u201cI think you are going to see more people standing in an urgent manner and in a bipartisan manner to make sure women are taken care of,\u201d said Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, who opposes abortion. \n\nWhere those resources might go could be controversial though. Hewitt and Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, both mentioned providing more funding for the state\u2019s network of anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. The facilities say they provide counseling, pregnancy tests and prenatal services while also offering counseling against abortion, but they have been accused of providing false and misleading information. \n\nIn the current budget cycle, the state has put $1.26 million worth of federal funding meant to assist low-income families toward anti-abortion pregnancy crisis centers. Women lawmakers and Rep. Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, are pushing for an additional $1 million for those organizations in the budget year that starts July 1. House Bill 909, sponsored by Edmonds, would support the centers in building a remote, online service network.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are certainly going to have to provide women\u2019s health at a higher level,\u201d said Edmonds, who is a Baptist pastor. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. The data is going to say we are going to see more babies, not less. So we have to find a way to add resources.\u201d\nLift Louisiana, an abortion rights advocacy organization, has raised concerns that many crisis pregnancy centers in Louisiana receiving funding from the state don\u2019t employ doctors or nurses or offer licensed medical care. The centers are also faith-based and don\u2019t provide birth control to clients. \n\nIn some cases, pregnancy centers have falsely claimed that abortion increases a person\u2019s risk for breast cancer and infertility or equated emergency contraception to abortion, according to a report from Lift Louisiana. Lift also says that pregnancy crisis centers have told clients that an abortion administered through medication can be \u201creversed\u201d \u2013 though there is no scientific data to support that theory. \n\nMichelle Erenberg, Lift Louisiana\u2019s executive director, said the centers need to be more closely monitored by the state, especially because they receive federal funding dedicated to helping low-income families. \n\n\u201cI do think there should be some licensing and regulation, and that they should have some medical staff that are licensed and trained,\u201d Erenberg told lawmakers last month.\u00a0\u00a0\nLegislators have not been willing to take any steps to provide more oversight of the crisis pregnancy centers so far. The Louisiana House on Wednesday rejected legislation from Rep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, that would have required the state to investigate the center\u2019s operations and use of public money.\n\nPoor health outcomes for Louisiana pregnancies\n\nIf an abortion ban results in more pregnancies and births in Louisiana, that increase will be happening in a state that already has one of the worst records on maternal health. Louisiana has one of the highest death rates among pregnant people of anywhere in the country.\n\nResearchers have said the poor track record on pregnancy is, in part, because large swaths of the state lack any access to medical care for pregnancies. Over a third of Louisiana parishes have no OB/GYN, birth center, nurse-midwives or hospital with an obstetric department, according to a 2020 analysis from the March of Dimes.\u00a0\nWhen people have to travel outside their community to receive basic prenatal care, pregnancies and births become riskier, the organization concluded.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIf Louisiana bans abortion, will the state spend more money on pregnant people, children?\nby Julie O'Donoghue, Louisiana Illuminator May 12, 2022\nIf Louisiana bans abortion, will the state spend more money on pregnant people, children?\nby Julie O'Donoghue, Louisiana Illuminator May 12, 2022\n Government leaders are split on whether the possibility of an abortion ban in Louisiana should require the state to devote more money to services for pregnant people and vulnerable children.\nGov.
