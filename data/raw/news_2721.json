Though just more than 50 percent of respondents selected \u201cat conception,\u201d the majority of replies to the tweet expressed frustration that he even brought it up. \u201cUnless you have a uterus, we don\u2019t want to hear what you or other men think about abortion,\u201d user Anne Rein wrote. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really expecting \u2026 that kind of response,\u201d said Claiborne, who has written books promoting communal, monastic living and demanding an end to the death penalty. \u201cI feel like folks that are familiar with my work know that I\u2019ve focused on a holistic ethic of life.\u201d He clarified his planned book will deal with an array of life issues, touching on abortion as a necessary element of that topic. The scolding Claiborne received from his followers despite his well-known liberalism shows a growing intolerance for pro-life legal and political positions in progressive Christianity. The Democratic Party has all but banished pro-lifers. Will liberal Christianity do the same? \u201cMy circles tend to be very divided on [abortion],\u201d said Claiborne. He said some use the Bible to justify bodily autonomy and reproductive rights while others emphasize living out pro-life convictions by supporting women and children in need and by opposing violence of other forms, such as the death penalty. In 2018, Pew Research reported that, while the majority of adults in evangelical Protestant denominations oppose abortion, the majority of adults in mainline Protestant denominations say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A Twitter poll Claiborne conducted on Oct. 14 put his Twitter followers in the second category, with about 68 percent saying abortion should be \u201clegal, safe, and rare,\u201d and another 9 percent saying it should be legal with no restrictions. Claiborne said he hoped Christians could unite together to end abortion by other means: \u201cI think we could actually work together across parties and political ideologies to make abortion rarer and rarer. \u2026 There\u2019s things that we know would reduce the number of abortions and make it more feasible for women to have healthy lives and healthy babies,\u201d such as, he says, affordable healthcare and childcare. But Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said prioritizing other solutions that preserve the sanctity of life shouldn\u2019t mean waffling on the question of abortion\u2019s immorality. \u201cThe pro-life generation is not monolithic,\u201d she said. Her organization\u2019s staff members and students vary on the political spectrum from liberal to conservative, but they\u2019re all united in their acknowledgment of abortion as a moral wrong that ends the life of a human being. She sees students facing pressure from their progressive peers to discard their pro-life values during elections. But she hopes they\u2019ll stand up for unborn life anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s the courageous thing to do to choose life and to draw that line in the sand,\u201d said Hawkins. \u201cCertainly not everyone is going to like you for doing that. If every church in America and every Christian in America would act like abortion is the violence it really is, then we wouldn\u2019t have abortion.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: A earlier version of this report contained incorrect information about Claiborne\u2019s college career. He attended Wheaton College for one year and graduated from Eastern University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeah Savas\nLeah is the life beat reporter for WORLD News Group.
