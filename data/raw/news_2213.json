Raphael Warnock asking him to reconsider his stance on abortion.\u00a0The letter was signed by mostly right-leaning Black pastors including\u00a0Bishop Garland Hunt, who\u00a0ran as a Republican for a Georgia House seat and lost in 2002, Wellington Boone, who ran for president as a Republican in 2016, and Alveda King, an outspoken Donald Trump ally and niece of Martin Luther King Jr.The letter was critical of Warnock\u2019s position on the issue, noting that abortion affects Black communities disproportionately and in their opinion, contradicts Christian teachings.The most recent CDC report on abortion, from 2016, found that the abortion rate for Non-Hispanic Black women ages 15-44 was 25.1 out of every 1,000 women. For Non-Hispanic white women, it was 6.6 out of 1,000.\u00a0The letter was signed by 16 pastors from churches around Georgia, and nine pastors from out of state. No Savannah clergy signed the letter.\u00a0\"Abortion decimates Black communities, disrupts Black families and inflicts untold harm on Black women,\" the pastors wrote.\u00a0\"Black women and Black families need your advocacy; they need your protection, and they need your support.\"\u201cAs a pastor who speaks for the Christian community, we implore you to speak the plain truth about a practice as barbaric and destructive as abortion,\u201d the letter reads.More:Georgia Senate debate: What Kelly Loeffler, Raphael Warnock said about abortionWarnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, spoke briefly about the issue at a debate on Dec. 6. As a Christian leader, his pro-choice abortion stance is atypical, but as a Democrat, it aligns with many in the party.\u00a0\"I have a profound reverence for life and an abiding respect for choice,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cThe question is: whose decision is it? And I happen to think that a patient's room is too small a place for a woman, her doctor and the U.S. government. I think there's too many people in the room.\"But those who are concerned about life, and I certainly am, ought to be focused on the incredibly high rates of infant mortality and maternal mortality in our country, when compared to other developed nations. That's something that government could work on. And I've been working on it my entire career.\"The Warnock campaign, reached Sunday afternoon, released a statement saying as much.\u00a0\"Warnock believes a patient's room is too small a place for a woman, her doctor, and the US government and that these are deeply personal health care decisions - not political ones. He also believes those who are concerned about life, ought to be focused on the incredibly high rates of infant mortality and maternal mortality and working to make sure we are expanding access to health care, not taking it away,\"\u00a0campaign spokesperson Michael J. Brewer said.More:Loeffler, Perdue need rural Republicans, but will they show up for Georgia senate runoffs?Warnock is running against Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp.\u00a0Loeffler, who has billed herself as \u201cmore conservative than Atilla the Hun,\u201d is vocally anti-abortion, has been endorsed by several large\u00a0pro-life organizations, including The National Right to Life Committee.At the Dec. 6 debate, Loeffler touched briefly on the subject during her attempts to tell Georgians \u201chow radical his views are, and how he would fundamentally change our country.\u201d\u201cI'm a Christian. I'm a person of deep faith. I don't need a lecture from someone who has used the Bible to not only justify attacking our military, that's not in Matthew 6:24,\u201d Loeffler said. \u201cIt doesn't say you can't serve the military and God, but he's also used the Bible to justify abortion.\u201dThe letter sent to Warnock was clear in its demands and against a\u00a0position\u00a0the pastors wrote is \"fundamentally in conflict with the plain reading of the Bible.\"\u00a0\u201cWe believe these statements represent grave errors of judgment and a lapse in pastoral responsibility, and we entreat you to reconsider them,\u201d the letter reads.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote Your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.savannahnow.com.
