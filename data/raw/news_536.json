Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, now heads to Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s desk.\n \u201cAbortion was the only legal and safe medical procedure that was explicitly prohibited for coverage on our state exchange,\u201d Hudson said in an interview last month.\u00a0\nUnder current law, health exchange plans are barred from covering abortion services in all but narrow circumstances. Those included life-endangering pregnancies and conception resulting from rape or incest. Otherwise, any Virginian who purchased health care coverage through the state marketplace would be required to pay out-of-pocket for abortion services.\u00a0\nLawmakers passed the ban in 2011, soon after the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The federal law included its own caveats on coverage. Under the ACA, insurers cannot be required to cover abortion. And then-President Barack Obama also signed an executive order \u2014 still in effect today \u2014 that prohibited federal subsidies from being used to cover abortion except in the same limited cases of rape, incest, or life-endangering pregnancies.\u00a0\nHudson emphasized Tuesday that the state law does nothing to change the federal restrictions already in place.\n\u201cThe bill will not require any health insurer to offer plans that cover abortion, nor will it require any patient to purchase a plan that covers abortion care,\u201d she said.\nRepublicans had previously raised concerns that the measure would allow federal funds to go toward abortion services.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why you have a number of people that are concerned about the intent of the Hyde amendment,\u201d Sen. Steve Newman, R-Bedford, said in January on the Senate floor, where the bill passed on a 20-18 vote. \u201cWhich is basically, there are some of us who believe that on this very controversial item, no tax money should be used in this way.\u201d\nAbortion is covered by many employer-provided plans, which aren\u2019t regulated under the Virginia marketplace. But both McClellan and Hudson had concerns that the prohibition disproportionately impacted low-income residents who purchased benefits through the state exchange. Hudson said it was especially important amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many Virginians have lost their jobs and employer-provided benefits.\nOut-of-pocket abortion services can be significant. According to Planned Parenthood, prices often start at $460 for the procedure alone. That doesn\u2019t include affiliated expenses, including sedation or the transportation and lost wage costs that many often shoulder.\nThe bill passed the House of Delegates on a 54-45 party-line vote on Tuesday. It narrowly cleared the Senate last month on 20-18 vote, with Republicans in the chamber also unanimously opposing the measure.\nThe vote is the latest step Democrats in Virginia have taken to roll back abortion restrictions enacted by the GOP since winning control of the General Assembly in 2019. Last year, lawmakers voted to repeal a state law that mandated an ultrasound and 24-hour waiting period before undergoing the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXGeneral Assembly votes to repeal ban on abortion coverage by plans on state insurance exchange\nby Kate Masters, Virginia Mercury February 16, 2021\nGeneral Assembly votes to repeal ban on abortion coverage by plans on state insurance exchange\nby Kate Masters, Virginia Mercury February 16, 2021\n Virginia lawmakers voted Tuesday to repeal a state law that prohibits plans on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange from covering abortions.\nThe measure, sponsored by Sen.
