Although its not a foregone conclusion, the likelihood of it being overturned is now higher. Even if\u00a0it is not overturned, it will\u00a0almost surely\u00a0be seriously weakened. The\u00a0current\u00a0reality is that nothing can be done to prevent a more conservative Supreme Court from\u00a0working its will. But we can and should reduce the number of women\u00a0seeking\u00a0an abortion in the first place.\u00a0Not only\u00a0will this strategy reflect a new\u00a0reality; it will be\u00a0responsive to the fact that abortion is not most people\u2019s first choice of how to deal with an untimely or unwanted birth. While about\u00a0two-thirds\u00a0of the public supports a woman\u2019s right to choose, they don\u2019t support it in all circumstances.\u00a0Most of them see it as a last resort and not\u00a0as the\u00a0ideal way to plan or space one\u2019s childbearing. \n\n\n\nAn overturned or weakened Roe v. Wade would leave it up\u00a0to each state to decide what to do.\u00a0Right\u00a0now,\u00a0there are\u00a0numerous states\u00a0trying to greatly restrict abortion, usually\u00a0limiting it to\u00a0the early weeks of pregnancy\u00a0(just the first six weeks in\u00a0Georgia, a period so short that many women would not even be aware that they were pregnant). Still,\u00a0a number of\u00a0states\u00a0will\u00a0likely\u00a0retain\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0access to abortion\u00a0in some if not in all circumstances.\u00a0Women with\u00a0sufficient means and knowledge\u00a0will\u00a0then\u00a0travel to states\u00a0with relatively liberal laws\u00a0if faced with an undesired or ill-timed pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNot everyone, however,\u00a0will be able to take advantage of these\u00a0more liberal\u00a0laws.\u00a0It will be\u00a0low-income women and\u00a0women of color\u00a0who will be\u00a0most\u00a0adversely\u00a0affected.\u00a0Their rates of\u00a0unintended\u00a0pregnancies are\u00a0four or five times\u00a0higher than for\u00a0higher-income\u00a0women.\u00a0More\u00a0of them\u00a0will\u00a0carry their pregnancies to term, leaving them\u00a0and their children\u00a0with\u00a0still-poorer\u00a0life\u00a0prospects.\u00a0A stronger safety net, and better jobs\u00a0can help\u00a0but cannot make up for\u00a0the longer-term effects\u00a0on them and their children as education and careers are interrupted,\u00a0short-term relationships fall apart, and children are deprived of the extra income and care that two parents\u00a0and a more stable\u00a0or smaller-sized\u00a0family\u00a0might\u00a0provide.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is a solution: providing\u00a0access to high-quality, affordable family planning services,\u00a0with a particular emphasis on\u00a0the most effective forms.\u00a0Effective does not\u00a0just\u00a0mean condoms,\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the Pill \u2013 two\u00a0common forms of birth control among\u00a0teens and\u00a0young adults. It means providing access to\u00a0long-acting reversible contraceptives such as the IUD. The\u00a0IUD\u00a0reduces\u00a0the unintended pregnancy rate to\u00a0near-zero, whereas the Pill\u00a0only\u00a0reduces it to 38% and the condom to\u00a063%\u00a0after five years\u00a0among sexually active individuals (Figure 1). Thus, these newer \u2013\u00a0and now safer\u00a0\u2013 forms of\u00a0long-acting\u00a0contraception\u00a0make realistic\u00a0the goal of ending\u00a0almost all\u00a0unplanned pregnancies,\u00a0and making abortion\u00a0very\u00a0rare.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that when these newer\u00a0forms of birth control are made widely available\u00a0at little or no cost,\u00a0and when\u00a0providers are trained\u00a0in how to insert\u00a0an\u00a0IUD and\u00a0how to\u00a0provide patient-centered counselling that respects a woman\u2019s\u00a0own preferences, the abortion rate plummets. We have\u00a0seen this happen\u00a0in both Colorado and in Delaware after their\u00a0governors made this a priority.\u00a0In Colorado, for example, following the launch of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative, teenage birth and abortion rates decreased by nearly 50%\u00a0from 2009 to 2014.\u00a0In Delaware,\u00a0through a partnership between\u00a0Upstream USA\u00a0and state healthcare systems,\u00a0the overall abortion rate fell by more\u00a0than a third\u00a0over\u00a0three years, from\u00a02015 to 2018\u00a0\u2013 a drop four times as large as the national average.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the good news. Unlike abortion\u00a0\u2013 about which\u00a0a number of\u00a0people\u00a0hold strongly negative\u00a0views\u00a0\u2013\u00a0very few women (or men) are opposed to contraception. Virtually\u00a0all\u00a0women aged 15\u201344\u00a0who have ever\u00a0been sexually active\u00a0have used contraception at some point in their lives, including 98% of Catholic\u00a0women.\u00a0Most couples\u00a0rely on it to make childbearing a choice and not an accident. The Supreme Court ruled in\u00a0Griswold v. Connecticut\u00a0in\u00a01965\u00a0that married couples should have access to birth control. Although Justice Barrett is\u00a0apparently\u00a0not a fan\u00a0of the Griswold decision, very few people agree with her. Any attempt to overturn that decision now would, we hope, literally be laughed out of court.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEmpowering women to only have children if, when, and with whom they want will not only improve women\u2019s lives, but also the\u00a0long-term prospects\u00a0of their children and the stability of the American family.\u00a0\n\nEmpowering women to only have children if, when, and with whom they want will not only improve women\u2019s lives, but also the\u00a0long-term prospects\u00a0of their children and the stability of the American family.\u00a0So,\u00a0ensuring knowledge of and access to all forms of contraception should be a top priority.\u00a0\nOne simple and inexpensive way to achieve this objective is to insert a question on every medical intake form asking a woman whether she does or does not want a child in the coming year\u00a0\u2013\u00a0with follow-up counselling and services based on\u00a0her\u00a0answer.\u00a0If she signals that she wants a baby, steps can be taken to ensure that she has a healthy pregnancy, thereby reducing infant and maternal mortality in the process.\u00a0If on the other hand, she indicates that she does not want to become\u00a0pregnant, a trained health care provider can help\u00a0her\u00a0achieve\u00a0that goal\u00a0as well.\u00a0Abortion rates\u00a0should then plummet, as they have in\u00a0 Colorado and Delaware, and both pro-life and pro-choice advocates\u00a0should\u00a0welcome the result.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nOf course, some conservatives, including Justice\u00a0Barrett,\u00a0may\u00a0oppose not just abortion but also contraception.\u00a0In\u00a02012,\u00a0she\u00a0signed a\u00a0public letter opposing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control benefit. As mentioned, just earlier this year, she\u00a0refused to take a stance\u00a0on whether Griswold v. Connecticut was correctly decided.\u00a0But that does not appear to be the majority view among her colleagues\u00a0on the Court, much less among the\u00a0U.S. population.\nWill the abortion war and its toxic effects on our politics end? Probably not. Nor,\u00a0one might argue, should\u00a0it,\u00a0given\u00a0the strong religious and moral values involved. But\u00a0a\u00a0truce\u00a0is badly needed. If the Court is going to\u00a0restrict\u00a0the right to\u00a0abortion, let\u2019s hope it will at least preserve the right to prevent\u00a0an unwanted\u00a0pregnancy,\u00a0which will\u00a0simultaneously\u00a0decrease abortions. Both sides in the war should recognize that they are on the same side in\u00a0valuing\u00a0a child\u2019s life, both before and after birth,\u00a0and the importance of human agency in\u00a0making that possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n        Related Content\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nPreventing unplanned pregnancy: Lessons from the states\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren & Families\n\n\n        Preventing unplanned pregnancy: Lessons from the states\n              \n\n\n\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIsabel V.
