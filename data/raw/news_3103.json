The March for Life, for decades an annual protest against abortion, arrives this year as the Supreme Court has indicated it will allow states to impose tighter restrictions on abortion with a ruling in the coming months. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) [\u00a0SUSAN WALSH  |  AP\u00a0]Published Feb. 19, 2022Last month, I left the warmth of our Tampa Bay weather for the icy cold of Washington, D.C. As a native Floridian, I endured eight hours in 15-degree weather with one goal: to distribute thousands of signs bearing the phrase \u201cLove them Both.\u201d I was there to March for Life alongside tens of thousands of Americans who support life for preborn babies.Kimberly Bird [\u00a0Provided\u00a0]As a member of Live Action \u2014 a human rights organization focused on ending abortion \u2014 we not only marched for babies but for mothers. To build a culture of life in our communities, we must love both the mother and her child by providing life-affirming support services while pregnant, after birth and throughout their lives.When I returned, I read columns speaking out against Florida\u2019s proposed 15-week abortion ban (HB 5/SB 146), which currently sits with the Senate. The essays described patients who chose later-term abortions. But did these women know of all their options? The citizens of Tampa Bay care deeply about our women and children \u2014 preborn or born \u2014 and we are home to life-affirming organizations that provide alternatives to abortion.Consider the sad, yet compelling scenarios that were discussed. One woman and her husband were thrilled to be pregnant, yet upon hearing the diagnosis of a \u201cnon-fatal, but serious fetal abnormality\u201d decided to end their child\u2019s life with a second-trimester abortion. As a society that increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusion, we must acknowledge that choosing death for a child solely on the grounds of a disability is abhorrent. As a mother of three, I can\u2019t imagine the sadness and fear that this woman experienced, but we have local services available to help.Perinatal Comfort Care of Tampa provides a nurturing place for families as they navigate the path following a fatal or grave prenatal diagnosis. They offer guidance, education and compassionate support to honor the life of the baby while seeking to relieve the family\u2019s emotional suffering. This is where I would\u2019ve suggested this couple could have turned.American Association of Pro-Life OBGYN\u2019s Dr. Christina Francis cares for all of her patients, both born and preborn. She says, \u201cThe science is explicitly clear that a living human being comes into existence at the moment of fertilization. As such, my fetal patients deserve to have their medical needs addressed \u2014 not to have their lives ended because they may need extra care.\u201dSimilarly tragic was the story of an abused mother who was 17 weeks\u2019 pregnant and had an abortion. Our community has countless groups that support women in abusive relationships. The Spring of Tampa Bay provides safe housing and essential support to women and their children with a 24-hour crisis hotline. These women are not alone, and encouraging them to choose death for their preborn baby only continues the cycle of violence.Spend your days with HayesSubscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletterColumnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.Loading...You\u2019re all signed\u00a0up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters\u00a0in\u00a0your\u00a0inbox?

We should refuse to live in a community where death is the answer. Killing our own \u2014 Floridians who have an intrinsic right to life \u2014 is not the way to a prosperous state. I urge our Senate and governor to approve the bill and re-focus our efforts on \u201cloving them both.\u201d The women and children of Tampa Bay deserve better.Kimberly Bird is vice president for external relations at Live Action, a human rights non-profit and the digital leader of the global pro-life movement. She lives in Tampa with her husband and daughters.Up next:Apply for your homestead exemption today to save on taxes | ColumnMORE FOR YOUHere\u2019s how to save Florida\u2019s coral reefs and build coastal resilienceEarlier today\u2022 OpinionEditorial cartoons for Monday from Times wire servicesMarch 17\u2022 OpinionAdvertisementTrump\u2019s bullying is a bad model for our children | LettersMarch 17\u2022 OpinionWhat Don\u2019t Say Gay really outlaws | EditorialMarch 16\u2022 OpinionTo cut Florida fentanyl deaths, end this century-old trade loophole nowMarch 16\u2022 OpinionWill a new Rays stadium draw fans?
