Wade is overturned and the GOP takes control of Congress.\nAbortion rights protesters during the Women's March on December 01, 2021 in Washington, DC. Getty Images for Women's March Inc\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe poll\u2014conducted May 4-6, after a draft opinion suggesting Roe will be overturned was leaked\u2014found 67% of respondents oppose a federal law that would make abortion illegal, including 76% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans.\n\n\n\nOnly 57% of those who want Roe to be overturned support a federal ban, while 43% want Roe to be struck down but don\u2019t want abortion outlawed nationwide.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are broadly in favor of state-level abortion restrictions, however, with 60% wanting their state to ban most or all abortions if Roe is overturned, and 76% believing abortion providers should face criminal penalties if they violate a state\u2019s abortion ban.\n\n\n\nA 66% majority of Republicans also support criminal punishments for those who get abortions if the procedure is outlawed, and 66% support consequences for those who help people obtain abortions.\n\n\nRepublicans\u2019 opposition to abortion stands in stark contrast to respondents overall: 55% of all respondents want abortion to remain at least mostly legal in their state if Roe is overturned, and at least 50% say those who perform, help with or undergo abortions should not face criminal penalties.\n\n\nMost Republicans don\u2019t want the procedure to be banned entirely without exemptions, however, with only 19% saying they want their state to ban all abortions and 29% saying abortion should be \u201cnot permitted,\u201d while a 45% plurality want it to be \u201cavailable with stricter limits.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBig Number\n50%. That\u2019s the share of all respondents who say they believe abortions should be \u201cgenerally available\u201d for people who want them, which CBS notes is a record high for the question since polling started in 1989. (Only 25% of Republicans say the same.) In line with other abortion polls, a 64% majority say they do not want Roe to be overturned, including 39% of Republicans.\nCrucial Quote\nA federal ban on abortion would be \u201cinconsistent what we've been fighting for four decades, which is that we wanted the Roe vs. Wade reversed and the authority to return to the states,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, explaining his opposition to a federal ban. \u201cAnd so as a matter of principle, that's where it should be.\u201d\n\nContra\nWhile federal legislation banning abortion would be broadly unpopular, a 58% majority support Congress passing a bill that legalizes the procedure\u2014even as the Senate is poised to strike down such legislation later this week.\nKey Background\nRepublicans in Congress have already held meetings to discuss efforts to introduce federal legislation that would ban abortion nationwide\u2014potentially as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy\u2014the Washington Post reported May 2. That report took on new urgency when Politico leaked a draft opinion hours later showing a majority of Supreme Court justices favor entirely overturning Roe as part of a case concerning Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban. The draft is from February and is not final\u2014the official opinion will likely be released in June\u2014though the Post reports a majority of justices still favored overturning the abortion decision as of last week. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Friday it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d Congress would legislate to restrict abortion nationwide if Roe is overturned, in addition to the 26 states that are expected to ban the procedure. \u201cIf the leaked opinion became the final opinion, legislative bodies\u2014not only at the state level but at the federal level\u2014certainly could legislate in that area,\u201d he told USA Today.\nWhat To Watch For\nWhether Republicans can regain control of Congress in the midterm elections, which would enable them to move forward with a nationwide abortion ban. The Post reported anti-abortion rights activists also plan to use the midterms to gague voters\u2019 support for various abortion ban proposals\u2014banning the procedure at six weeks versus 15 weeks, for instance\u2014which could determine what any federal legislation would look like.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nMost who support Roe see an overturn as a danger to women, other rights \u2014 CBS News poll (CBS News)\nRepublicans Will Try To Ban Abortion Nationwide If Supreme Court Overturns Roe V.
