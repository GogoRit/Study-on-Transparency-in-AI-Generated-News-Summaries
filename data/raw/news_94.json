Kamala Harris has raised more than $160,000 for abortion rights groups on Wednesday following Alabama\u2019s new draconian anti-abortion legislation.\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama signed into law a near-total abortion ban that allows no exceptions for cases of rape or incest and could punish doctors who perform the procedures with life in prison. The law is now the strictest anti-abortion bill in the country.\nArticle continues after video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a fundraising email that compared Alabama\u2019s decision to the dystopian book and TV series, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, the 2020 presidential hopeful. asked her supporters to donate money that would be split among four groups fighting for abortion rights: the Yellowhammer Fund, the Clinic Vest Project, ARC Southeast and the National Network of Abortion Funds.\n\u201cOutlawing access to abortion \u2015 including in cases of rape or incest. Threatening to punish doctors who provide abortion care with up to 99 years of jail time. This isn\u2019t a scene from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. This is happening in Alabama \u2015 in our country \u2015 in the year 2019,\u201d read the email. \n\nRestricting access to safe, legal abortion puts women\u2019s lives at risk. We need your voice now, more than ever, in this fight. Join me in splitting a donation to @yellowfund, @ClinicVest, @abortionfunds, and @ARC_Southeast now: https://t.co/jESkDv4whb\u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 15, 2019\n\nIt added: \u201cWe cannot afford to wring our hands. We need to fight back, raising our voice together to say we won\u2019t be dragged backward and putting our collective power to work.\u201d\nAs\u00a0ESSENCE previously reported, the Alabama law will not go into effect for another six months.\nTOPICS:\u00a0  Abortion alabama abortion law Alabama Election 2020 kamala harris\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
