Wade\u00a0law that offered substantial protection for the unborn, which the court had previously blocked after\u00a0Roe. The second\u00a0brief\u00a0asks the court to appoint Dr. Hazelrigg as the individual to legally represent the best interests of unborn children in Arizona.\n\n\u201cNow that the U.S. Supreme Court has overruled\u00a0Roe, Arizona is eager to preserve the innocent lives of the unborn and restore dignity to women and the medical profession,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Denise Harle, director of the ADF Center for Life. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to work alongside Attorney General Brnovich in defending the state\u2019s duly enacted law that protects the lives of mothers and their children.\u201d\n\nThe state of Arizona can exercise its legitimate interests in protecting the lives of unborn children and the health and safety of mothers by defending its pro-life law now that\u00a0Roe\u00a0has been overturned. As the brief filed in\u00a0Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Brnovich\u00a0explains \u201cthe overwhelmingly optional and elective nature of abortions in Arizona does not justify permitting abortion\u2019s proven harm to unborn children and their mother\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nADF attorneys are working in six other states to defend pro-life laws:\u00a0West Virginia,\u00a0Iowa,\u00a0Michigan,\u00a0Montana,\u00a0North Carolina, and\u00a0North Dakota.\n\nPronunciation guide: Harle (HAR\u2019-lee)\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building, non-profit legal organization committed to protecting religious freedom, free speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life.\n# # #\n\n\n\n\nRelated Press Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 11th, 2023\n\n\n\nAZ Supreme Court to weigh state's pro-life law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 23rd, 2023\n\n\n\nArizona Supreme Court will hear case challenging state's pro-life law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 24th, 2023\n\n\n\nPro-life groups urge AZ Supreme Court to uphold state law protecting women, children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1st, 2023\n\n\n\nDoctor asks Arizona high court to uphold state's pro-life law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1st, 2024\n\n\n\nAbortion Is Not Health Care.
