(Courtesy of Creighton University)\n\n\n\n\n\nLINCOLN \u2014 As debate begins on a Nebraska proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state, some medical professionals are worried about how exceptions in the law would be utilized.\nLegislative Bill 626, proposed by State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, would outlaw abortions at around six weeks when cardiac activity can be detected. Abortions are currently allowed in the state up to 20 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for the life of the mother.\nThe bill is scheduled for first-round debate\u00a0Wednesday for an allotted eight hours.\nAt the bill\u2019s public hearing, doctors opposing LB 626 outnumbered those in support by a margin of at least four to one.\n  Dr. Robert Bonebrake. (Courtesy of Methodist Health System)\nDr. Robert Bonebrake, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Omaha who testified in support of the bill, said one of LB 626\u2019s changes includes extending the exception for the life of the mother.\nThe bill specifically protects \u201ca medical judgment that could be made by a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved.\u201d\n\u201cThis bill actually is more favorable and friendly to physicians than the one that\u2019s currently on the books,\u201d Bonebrake said.\nThe current law includes \u201cwould,\u201d he said, with the change providing \u201cmuch more breadth and width\u201d for physicians who feel that maternal health is threatened.\nDr. Emily Patel, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Omaha, disagreed.\u00a0\nShe said the introduction of LB 626 has already led to cascading fear among her patients, who are either pregnant or wish to become pregnant.\nIn one way or another, Patel said, almost every patient she sees brings up LB 626.\n\u201cI think it comes from a place of fear and unknown and what\u2019s going to happen to me and my family if I\u2019m in one of these terrible scenarios where this law might prevent me from being able to access the care that I need,\u201d Patel said.\nDr. Elizabeth Constance, a reproductive endocrinologist in Omaha, said that while abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, no Nebraska provider performs abortions after 18 weeks.\nConstance pointed to rural counties of the state that do not have an obstetrical provider, with some patients already traveling great distances for care.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s only going to get worse as we limit access to health care and as we tell doctors that we don\u2019t trust them to make decisions to their full expertise and training,\u201d Constance said.\n12-week \u2018compromise\u2019\nLast year, Albrecht proposed outlawing abortions entirely if the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, which it ended up doing later that year. That proposal failed to advance by one vote.\nBonebrake noted that LB 626 offers multiple exclusions that the 2022 proposal did not, including rape, incest, the life of the mother, in vitro fertilization, miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. Some of those, he noted, have been lost in some of the discussion and \u201cnoise\u201d surrounding the bill.\nA proposed amendment by State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston would also restrict abortion but instead allow abortions up to 12 weeks, which is seen as a \u201ccompromise.\u201d\u00a0\nRiepe\u2019s amendment adds an additional exception for a \u201cfetal anomaly incompatible with life,\u201d which is defined as an anomaly diagnosed before birth that will \u201cwith reasonable certainty result in the death of the unborn child within three months.\u201d Conditions that could be treated after birth would not be protected.\u00a0\n  Dr. Emily Patel. (Courtesy of Emily Patel)\nPatel said many of the high-risk patients she sees might face fetal anomalies, though most are not diagnosable until well into the second trimester, typically about 18-20 weeks.\u00a0\nNeither Albrecht\u2019s nor Riepe\u2019s proposals would adequately protect these patients nor work for Nebraska, Patel said.\n\u201cOnce we start getting into 15, 16, 17 weeks, if we have a complication in pregnancy, we\u2019re going to start to doubt whether or not we\u2019re within the bounds of the law in taking care of patients the best way we know how,\u201d Patel said.\nConstance said LB 626 \u201cattempts to pay lip service to exceptions\u201d that in reality may not be realized.\nFor example, she said determining whether an abortion is necessary to save a mother\u2019s life isn\u2019t clear-cut and some doctors fear that one differing opinion could void the legal exception.\nOpinions could differ among a group of highly trained, well-qualified maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Bonebrake said those fears are covered under LB 626\u2019s wording change.\nThe Riepe amendment does not provide exceptions for sexual assault or incest, as the original bill does.\nConstance said requirements for rape or incest could likely include obtaining a police report. However, a vast majority of survivors never report their assault or might not do so right away.\nUnder LB 626, patients would be locked into a six-week period to make that decision. This is about two weeks after a missed menstrual cycle and when many women may not know they are pregnant.\n\u201cWe can line out these exceptions on paper, but if they don\u2019t actually do what they say they\u2019re going to do in real life, they\u2019re not real exceptions,\u201d Constance said.\nThe Riepe amendment also does not appear to include the wording change to provide doctors more latitude in life-threatening situations.\n\u2018Gut-wrenching\u2019 decisions\nPatel said that in the course of talking about legislation such as LB 626, she often wishes senators could sit in during counseling sessions and see the \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d decisions patients must face.\nOne example she offered is a fetus that doesn\u2019t have kidneys or that has nonfunctioning kidneys, meaning the baby can\u2019t survive once it\u2019s born.\n  Dr. Elizabeth Constance. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)\nConstance said patients may be forced to carry a baby to term with a condition not compatible with life. Under those circumstances, patients face a higher risk of preeclampsia, high blood pressure, cardiac issues and hemorrhage after delivery.\nAll of that comes, Patel said, \u201cwhen we know what the end is going to be.\u201d\n\u201cI cry with patients,\u201d Patel said. \u201cI see patients having to face decisions that they would never wish on their worst enemies.\u201d\nBonebrake said there may be a slightly greater risk in some maternal situations, but he emphasized lethal fetal anomalies occur in a minority of pregnancies.\u00a0\nAnd if there is any risk to the life of the mother, he said, physicians will act.\n\u201cAny physician providing best medical practices is safe under this framework of LB 626,\u201d Bonebrake said at the bill\u2019s Feb. 1 public hearing. \u201cOnly those who would have reason for concern would be physicians whose conduct is so far outside the mainstream, so indifferent to human life, that a well-informed physician could never have made the same decision.\u201d\n\u2018Substandard care\u2019\nPatel warned of the possible impact of the bill on hospital care, particularly in rural Nebraska.\nA hospital in Idaho that served a city of more than 9,000 people announced in March it would no longer provide obstetrical services, citing staffing issues and the political climate. Idaho has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.\nPatel said that incident should be one of the \u201cbiggest cautionary tales\u201d for Nebraska as similar decisions could be made here in the future.\u00a0\nConstance added that the vast majority of doctors practice where they did their residency, and if medical students decide against accepting residencies in Nebraska \u2014 or if there are fewer or lower-quality residents \u2014\u00a0medicine across the board will suffer.\nShe predicted those impacts will first be seen in fewer OB-GYN providers and cascade down through neonatologists who deal with premature babies, pediatricians, intensivists and internal medicine doctors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop at obstetrics and gynecology, although that in and of itself would be devastating,\u201d Constance said.\nBonebrake said the reverse argument could be made, that restricting abortion could bring in more medical providers.\u00a0\nDr. Elena Kraus, an OB-GYN in Lincoln, said at the bill\u2019s hearing that physicians want to live in a state standing for \u201clife-affirming medicine.\u201d\nHowever, Bonebrake emphasized that these predictions are \u201cbased on nothing other than people\u2019s conjecture and noise.\u201d\nLB 626 is another example of lawmakers attempting to legislate medical decisions and put them into a \u201cnice box and put a bow on it,\u201d Patel said.\nShe said the bill could prevent doctors from providing a full range of medical care.\n\u201cBy hindering my ability to do that, we\u2019re providing substandard care to patients of Nebraska, and patients will suffer for that,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere will be collateral damage. There will be patients who will suffer morbidity, and there will be patients who will die because of bans like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXSome Nebraska doctors fear \u2018collateral damage\u2019 from proposed near-total abortion ban\nby Zach Wendling, Nebraska Examiner April 12, 2023\nSome Nebraska doctors fear \u2018collateral damage\u2019 from proposed near-total abortion ban\nby Zach Wendling, Nebraska Examiner April 12, 2023\n LINCOLN \u2014 As debate begins on a Nebraska proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state, some medical professionals are worried about how exceptions in the law would be utilized.\nLegislative Bill 626, proposed by State Sen.
