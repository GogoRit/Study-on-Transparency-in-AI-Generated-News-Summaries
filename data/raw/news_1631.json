If the group \u2013 which played a key role in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health, the supreme court case that ushered in Roe\u2019s demise \u2013 is granted a nationwide injunction, as requested, the decision could apply to states where abortion remains legal.On Thursday evening, Kacsmaryk filed an order allowing Danco Laboratories, the drug manufacturer, to file briefs defending its FDA approval. Plaintiffs have until 24 February to respond; a decision in the case could come at any time after that.\u201cThis ruling could be devastating for abortion care,\u201d said Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health. \u201cCutting off critical access to abortion medication \u2013 which is the preferred method for more than half of abortion patients in the country \u2013 would cause significant harm, especially at a time when Dobbs has made it difficult or impossible for many to get care at clinics.\u201dThe FDA first approved the use of mifepristone, which is taken alongside the drug misoprostol during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, for abortion care in 2000. More than 3.7 million women have used the drug since it became available in the US. Mifepristone works by blocking the pregnancy hormone progesterone, which prevents a pregnancy from growing. Taken up to two days later, misoprostol induces cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus.The agency broadened access to abortion pills in 2021 by allowing patients to receive them by mail through telehealth rather than requiring in-person hospital or clinic visits, a rule change prompted by the Covid pandemic. The FDA widened access further when it announced in January it would allow certified retail pharmacies to dispense mifepristone, known under the brand name Mifeprex. The use of abortion medication has steadily risen over time and now comprise at least 53% of abortions in the US, making it the most common choice for pregnancy termination.View image in fullscreenPeople gather for the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in January. Photograph: Bryan Olin Dozier/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe lawsuit, filed by four physicians and anti-abortion organizations including the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, claims that the FDA \u201cexceeded its regulatory authority\u201d by fast-tracking approval of the drug two decades ago. The groups allege that the agency erred in its legal obligations to \u201cprotect the health, safety, and welfare\u201d of pregnant women by eliminating necessary safeguards and \u201cignoring\u201d evidence of harm.\u201cThe FDA is entrusted to protect the public from dangerous drugs but it has failed women and girls by approving these abortion pills without the basic levels of protection when evaluating for safety and effectiveness,\u201d said Erik Baptist, Alliance Defending Freedom senior legal counsel.In response to the suit, the FDA called the legal request to remove a pharmaceutical drug from the market \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented\u201d saying that withdrawing access to mifepristone would \u201ccause significant harm\u201d by depriving patients of a safe and effective drug that has been in use for more than 20 years.\u201cPlaintiffs have pointed to no case, and the government has been unable to locate any example, where a court has second-guessed FDA\u2019s safety and efficacy determination and ordered a widely available FDA-approved drug to be removed from the market \u2013 much less an example that includes a two-decade delay,\u201d wrote attorneys for the US justice department in a 13 January filing.Greer Donley, associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School and expert in FDA law, says the suit\u2019s legal argument is rife with \u201cfalsehoods and mischaracterizations\u201d of the regulatory agency\u2019s decision-making. Donley says the FDA \u201crigorously\u201d reviewed mifepristone before approving it, requesting additional clinical trials and restrictions in distribution. She points to a 55-page audit from the Government Accountability Office which found that FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone was consistent with its approval and oversight for other drugs.\u201cThis drug was certainly not approved in a rush or haphazardly,\u201d says Donley. \u201cIn fact, many argue the FDA has actually been largely overprotective and restrictive when it comes to mifepristone, so it\u2019s a bit ironic that these onerous regulations around the drug are being used as evidence of leniency.\u201dAs one of the most studied drugs in the world, abortion medication \u2013 in use for more than two decades in the US \u2013 is found to be safe and effective, and backed by major medical organizations including the the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It holds a safer track record than penicillin, Viagra and even Tylenol. Legal abortions have been found to be 14 times safer than childbirth.Removing medication abortion as an option holds \u201cterrifying potential consequences\u201d for abortion patients across the US, says Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate with reproductive health research group the Guttmacher Institute. The non-invasive method allows patients to terminate a pregnancy in their own homes, especially helpful if travel to clinics is out of reach. Some providers have signaled that if mifepristone is banned, they will offer misoprostol-only abortions, a safe alternative method, but one that can carry more side-effects and a slightly higher failure rate \u2013 misoprostol alone was found in a new study to be 88% effective, while the pill combination has been shown to have a success rate of 98%.Without access to pills, patients would probably need to undergo procedural \u2013 also known as \u201csurgical\u201d \u2013 abortion. These procedures must be performed in-clinic and necessitate more travel, resources, time, staff and space \u2013 increasingly difficult as overburdened clinics face an influx of displaced patients. Even if the impending ruling takes a more narrow approach than pulling the drug off the market completely \u2013 for example, by blocking medication by mail, or by reinstating the in-person dispensing requirement \u2013 it would still significantly hinder access.The suspension of an FDA-approved drug by the judiciary set not only a \u201ctroubling precedent\u201d for other reproductive health care but have \u201cserious and broad implications\u201d for all pharmaceutical drugs approved by the federal agency which would see its authority severely weakened, says Donley.Reproductive health advocates and many legal observers worry that a suit that would be \u201claughed out of court\u201d in other circumstances could find a champion in Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a former religious liberties lawyer who has a history of attacking abortion rights and birth control. Appointed to the bench by former president Donald Trump in 2019, Kacsmaryk most recently ruled against a federal program that allows Texas teenagers to access birth control without their parents\u2019 permission.\u201cIt is clear that this is a very intentional and strategic decision by the plaintiffs to forum-shop for a judge that holds similar radical views,\u201d says Donley.If Kacsmaryk rules for the plaintiffs and the Biden administration chooses to appeal, it will contend with the fifth circuit court of appeals, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the US. From there, the case could reach the US supreme court.The FDA lawsuit is part of a multi-front war waged by anti-abortion activists against medication abortion. While the federal agency has loosened some restrictions on mifepristone, abortion is still banned in 13 states across the US with 18 states carrying laws that limit the use of abortion drugs. As they reconvene this year, conservative statehouses across the country are ramping up proposals to further restrict abortion medication by banning the mailing of pills and making it illegal to distribute, manufacture, or prescribe, the medication, says Nash. Extreme measures introduced in Oklahoma and Arkansas would allow those who self-manage their abortions with pills to be prosecuted. Meanwhile, two lawsuits out of North Carolina and West Virginia seek to challenge those states\u2019 restrictions on the pills, arguing that the FDA\u2019s regulations on abortion medication should override state law.\u201cOpponents of reproductive freedom set their sights on shutting down abortion clinics and found success after the fall of Roe v Wade,\u201d says Miller. \u201cNow, they are turning their attention very intensely \u2013 and very aggressively \u2013 to medication abortion as their next battleground because they know it still provides a remaining pathway to access.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionReproductive rightsRoe v WadeTexasLaw (US)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
