She was sentenced to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide but has maintained her innocence.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4The Argentine women who fought for legal abortion \u2013 and wonlist 2 of 4Thailand legalises early abortions; pro-choice groups want morelist 3 of 4Honduras hardened its abortion ban.

A new court date has not yet been set.\nSara is one of the dozens of women currently behind bars for abortion-related crimes in El Salvador, which banned abortion in all circumstances in 1998. Women\u2019s rights groups say most of these women come from poor, rural areas and experienced obstetric emergencies, not abortions.\nThe United Nations has repeatedly denounced El Salvador\u2019s criminalisation of women suspected of abortion, including in a 2020 report that called for the end of arbitrary detention of three women, including Sara.\nWomen hold up letters forming the word \u2018abortion\u2019 during a march to mark Women\u2019s Day in San Salvador, El Salvador, in March 2020 [Jessica Orellana/Reuters]\n\u201cIf El Salvador is really serious about its international obligations to human rights, this is an opportunity to free Sarita,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guillen, a lawyer consulting for Sara\u2019s legal team as executive director of Women\u2019s Equality Center, a US-based organisation that supports feminist organising in Latin America.\nThe abortion-related convictions violate due process, Avila-Guillen told Al Jazeera, and due to \u201cthe stigma around these cases, these women have to proactively prove their innocence\u201d.\nIn an upcoming hearing, lawyers are expected to present new evidence from forensic experts that they say demonstrates that Sara\u2019s miscarriage was natural and that previous testimony was prejudiced.\n\u201cOur hope is that the judge, after hearing this evidence, will determine that it changes the outcome of the case and that Sara is innocent,\u201d said Avila-Guillen.\nIf released, Sara would join at least 15 other women who have been let out of prison since 2018 through appeals, retrials and commutations of their sentences.\n \n\n\n\n \nManuela case\nThis month, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights also heard arguments in a case that could force El Salvador to recognise that its policy has violated the human rights of dozens of women imprisoned for abortion-related crimes.\nThe women\u2019s rights groups that filed the case accuse the Salvadoran state of violating the right to life and health of Manuela, a woman who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 after suffering complications during childbirth.\nManuela, identified by a pseudonym to protect her family, died of cancer in 2010 while imprisoned. Women\u2019s rights groups say she did not receive adequate medical care prior to her death.\nThe case seeks reparations for Manuela\u2019s parents and sons, who live in poverty in a rural area of El Salvador and have suffered emotionally because of Manuela\u2019s imprisonment and untimely death. Manuela\u2019s two sons were seven and nine when she was convicted.\n \n\n\n\n \nIn a call with the press before the hearings on March 10 and 11, Manuela\u2019s son Santos, now 21, asked the Salvadoran authorities to consider the harm on children when they prosecute women in these cases.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to happen again because as a child, you suffer,\u201d said Santos. He said his mother\u2019s conviction left him and his brother orphans. \u201cWe\u2019ve had my grandmother but it\u2019s not the same. We don\u2019t have the love of our mother.\u201d\nThe case, which will be decided within a year, could also have implications that extend beyond Manuela\u2019s family.\n\u201cWe hope that this case opens the door so that these situations don\u2019t happen again and no other woman has to go through this,\u201d Catalina Martinez Coral, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the groups that filed the case, said during the news conference.\nTides shifting?\nPast attempts to decriminalise abortion in El Salvador have been unsuccessful, including two proposals in 2018 to allow abortion under certain exceptions that legislators failed to bring to a vote for fear of backlash from religious conservatives.\nIn El Salvador, Catholic and evangelical pro-life groups often coordinate protests and social media campaigns against efforts to liberalise the country\u2019s abortion ban. They argue the victims in these cases are the unborn foetuses, rather than the imprisoned women or their families.\nBut women\u2019s rights activists in the country hope the tides are shifting.\nAn historic December decision by legislators in Argentina to legalise abortion through the 14th week of pregnancy without restrictions energised women\u2019s rights activists throughout the region.\nEl Salvador\u2019s Vice President Felix Ulloa recently said in an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that legislators are reviewing the total abortion ban as part of a larger effort to reform the constitution, which currently enshrines the right to life starting at conception.\n \nPresident Nayib Bukele has previously said he believes no woman should be imprisoned for an obstetric emergency. His New Ideas (Nuevas Ideas) party won a majority of seats in Congress in February elections, although a party-wide stance on legalising abortion is unclear.\nBukele\u2019s office did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment.\nFeminist activists in El Salvador say they will continue to pressure legislators to loosen the abortion ban when the new legislators take office in May. In the meantime, they are trying to help Sara and the dozens of women who have been criminalised and imprisoned for abortions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem of what colour the party flag is in each seat. It\u2019s a problem of public responsibility,\u201d said Salvadoran feminist activist Morena Herrera. \u201cIt\u2019s been clearly shown that the total prohibition of abortion harms Salvadoran society.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
