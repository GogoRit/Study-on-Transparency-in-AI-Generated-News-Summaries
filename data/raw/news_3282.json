Jackson Women\u2019s Health, a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, long before fetal viability. Experts believe this could be the most important abortion case in decades and could undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade. Photo by Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first decades after Roe v. Wade was decided, anti-abortion forces made the case that they were the real pro-women movement.\u00a0\nThey claimed to love the sinner (the fallen woman) but hated the sin of abortion. They just wanted to save female babies. And some promised to be there with the first box of diapers (the roughly 250 subsequent boxes were always going to be your responsibility).\nIt was a myth perpetuated in gullible reporting that often swept the movement\u2019s long record of intimidation, violence, arson and murder under the rug. (\u201cEvery movement has its extremists,\u201d pundits would tsk, while conveniently ignoring that abortion rights advocates didn\u2019t resort to terrorist tactics to get their point across).\nAnd so, anti-abortion activists had a lot of people fooled when they promised that if the Supreme Court ever overturned abortion, they would never hunt women down and prosecute them for terminating a pregnancy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nBut the movement became more emboldened over the years as a powerful force in the Republican Party, proposing a slew of creatively cruel restrictions, like forcing Michigan women to purchase \u201crape insurance\u201d since standard health policies couldn\u2019t cover abortion, even in the case of sexual assault.\u00a0\nAfter religious right darling Sarah Palin landed on the 2008 GOP ticket, more Republicans started dispensing with the fiction that they supported exceptions for health, rape, incest and the mother\u2019s life. And we began hearing more and more that throwing doctors in jail was a just outcome (Michigan\u2019s poorly written, 91-year-old abortion ban allows this).\nThen Donald Trump came on the scene. There\u2019s no evidence that he was ever pro-life, but he gleefully jumped on the bandwagon while running for president in 2016 to prove he really was a Republican. Only Trump was never a quick study \u2014 he reportedly didn\u2019t read intelligence briefings in office, but would look at pretty graphs \u2014 so he would say the quiet part out loud, like that \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have abortions.\nNaturally, Republicans and their anti-abortion benefactors quickly denied that would happen and Trump\u2019s favorite daughter, Ivanka, was dispatched to reassure suburban women and insider journalists that her dad didn\u2019t mean any of that.\nBut that, of course, has become the official policy of today\u2019s GOP now that the far-right court couldn\u2019t wait to overturn Roe to signal that the era of universal human rights (however imperfect in practice) is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy don\u2019t pro-lifers care about the trauma inflicted on a child who was already sexually violated and then forced to give birth? How do we think she will ever have a normal, happy, healthy life? Why should her life be sacrificed?\n\n\nOne of the first victims of this misogynistic fiat was a 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio who was forced to travel to Indiana to terminate her pregnancy.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s clear that a lot of Republicans skipped health class, but pregnancy and childbirth can be dangerous even for healthy, adult women (far more so than abortion).\u00a0\nMy first pregnancy was considered normal. I never had severe complications, but I was still hospitalized twice for severe dehydration because I had violent morning sickness up until the day I gave birth \u2014 and that\u2019s pretty minor compared to diabetes, high blood pressure or being on bed rest for months. I also had a Cesarean section, which is major surgery (my then-husband watched doctors juggle my organs while trying to get our child out). Oh, and I was expected to be back to work six weeks after that and had to negotiate for more time off (none of which was paid).\nEven under the best of circumstances, we face a world that\u2019s hostile to the well-being of mothers and children, despite the flowery pro-life rhetoric.\nI can\u2019t believe I have to explain this, but a fifth-grader does not have a body suited to carrying or delivering a baby. (The World Health Organization found that the leading killer of girls 15 to 19 \u2014 who are years older \u2014 is pregnancy and childbirth complications). Expecting young girls to fully understand what\u2019s happening is sadistic. Journalist Jill Filopovic recalls interviewing a 12-year-old rape victim who responded to being told she was going to have a baby by hearbreakingly asking if she could have a doll instead.\nWhy don\u2019t pro-lifers care about the trauma inflicted on a child who was already sexually violated and then forced to give birth? How do we think she will ever have a normal, happy, healthy life? Why should her life be sacrificed?\nBut GOP Ohio Senate nominee J.D. Vance flippantly dismissed such circumstances as \u201cinconvenient,\u201d adding, \u201cThe question to me is really about the baby.\u201d\nMichigan GOP gubernatorial hopeful Garrett Soldano is on the same page, announcing that rape victims who become pregnant must \u201cprotect that DNA and allow it to happen.\u201d\u00a0\nYou also have Republicans trying to pass laws charging doctors with \u201cabortion murder\u201d if they don\u2019t \u201creimplant an ectopic pregnancy\u201d in the uterus \u2014 which is medically impossible \u2014 so it\u2019s abundantly clear that anti-abortion activists don\u2019t care about facts or pregnant people\u2019s health.\nSo now that Roe is dead and reality has set in, have Republicans become more compassionate? In a word, no. They\u2019re even more emboldened, cooking up laws barring people from crossing state lines for abortions, putting bounties on their heads and making every miscarriage a potential crime.\nTake Kristi Noem, a red-state governor and likely 2024 contender, who was asked about the case of the 10-year-old. After giving the perfunctory answer that this was \u201chorrific\u201d she declared, \u201cBut, in South Dakota, the law today is that the abortions are illegal, except to save the life of the mother.\u201d\nPro-lifers have proved that they\u2019re not just into punishing women \u2014 they also delight in punishing child victims of horrific crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFar-right justices and overzealous GOP leaders have fundamentally changed the issue.

Abortion is no longer a personal decision for you and your family.

Now we have more than half the population that can\u2019t make basic decisions because the state has the ultimate power. And you have a political party dedicated to making the process as cruel and dangerous as possible.\nThat\u2019s a whole new ballgame. And that\u2019s why the SCOTUS decision is deeply unpopular with the vast majority of the country. Far-right justices think they can issue edicts swiftly snatching away other basic rights of privacy, contraception, same-sex marriage and non-discrimination and the majority will simply acquiesce.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur nation turned 246 years old yesterday.
