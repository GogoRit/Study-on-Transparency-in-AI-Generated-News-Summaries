They arrive here at 8:30 a.m. on the dot, regular as clock-punchers, on the three days a week the Huntsville clinic is open to perform abortions. The women and girls arrive dressed for comfort in sweatpants and shower slides, carrying pillows from home or holding the hand of a partner or friend. The escorts, meanwhile, wear brightly colored vests and wield giant umbrellas to block the incoming patients from the sight, if not the sound, of the other group that comes here like clockwork: the protesters.To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. Sometimes there are as many as a dozen. This day there were four: one woman, three men, all white. Four doesn\u2019t sound like that many until you\u2019re downwind of them maniacally hollering: Mommy, don\u2019t kill me! You\u2019re lynching your black baby! They rip their arms and legs off! They suffer! They torture them! But escorts are made of stern stuff. Josie, with her short snow-white ponytail and T-shirt spangled with buttons (fearless flawless feminist, abortion is normal), doesn\u2019t get paid to defend, as she puts it, \u201cthese patients, these doctors, this staff.\u201d Nevertheless, that\u2019s her job. Among those Josie has sworn to protect is Willie Parker, an ob-gyn who has worked here for the past several years and who, until recently, was a hero of the reproductive-rights movement.Last fall, while trying to defend Parker\u2014not in this parking lot, but in the no-less-divisive wilds of Facebook message boards\u2014Josie got dragged into a dispute that has shaken the reproductive-rights movement, from its uppermost reaches to its grassroots volunteers. One of Josie\u2019s fellow escorts was called \u201ctrash\u201d after she spoke up for Parker; others were told they didn\u2019t deserve to be escorts. The people hurling the insults were not pro-lifers but fellow abortion-rights foot soldiers: How dare Josie\u2014how dare anyone\u2014not believe Candice?On March 25, 2019, the activist Candice Russell posted a 3,300-word essay on the website Medium titled \u201cTo All the Women Whose Names I Don\u2019t Know, About the Pain We Share, the Secrets We Keep, and the Silence That Shouldn\u2019t Have Been Asked For.\u201d In prose that was by turns confusing and moving, Russell wrote that after a year and a half of casual texting and a handful of face-to-face meetups, she and Parker had met for dinner in Dallas in October 2016. She got drunk, while he, she discovered partway through the evening, stuck to tonic water and lime. Then they went back to his hotel room, where she continued to drink, and they had sex.Russell did not write that she\u2019d told Parker she didn\u2019t want to sleep with him, but she strongly implied that, having downed \u201cfour martinis and an entire bottle of wine,\u201d she was inebriated beyond any practical ability to consent. And, in a sweeping accusation that extended far beyond what had happened between the two of them in that hotel room, she called him a \u201cpredator.\u201d She\u2019d gradually learned, she wrote, that the way he\u2019d treated her was part of a pattern. Rumors about his behavior swirled in \u201cwhispers [that] had become so loud they were more like shouts\u201d\u2014and unnamed movement leaders were refusing to expose him.Russell did not report Parker to the police, and unlike, say, the cases of Matt Lauer at NBC or even Al Franken in the Senate, a workplace investigation was never on the table: The activist and the doctor operated in the same sphere, but they weren\u2019t colleagues. Instead, the case of Russell versus Parker has been battled out largely on message boards and in closed-door conversations within the insular, impassioned realm of abortion rights, among people, mostly women, for whom the cause of bodily autonomy was a calling long before the dawn of the #MeToo movement. Yet its tentacles stretch much further, bringing into the open generational and, to an extent, racial divisions in our rapidly shifting views on sexual assault\u2014the kinds of questions and doubts that are typically expressed only in private. How does alcohol figure into culpability? What constitutes appropriate sexual behavior when one person has more power than the other? And perhaps most crucial, how absolute is the duty to believe women\u2014the rallying cry of #MeToo?One anti-abortion group reveled in the allegations against Parker: \u201cThousands of women have been sexually assaulted or raped by abortionists.\u201dThat the saga of Candice Russell and Willie Parker is set in the abortion-rights world heightens the stakes, and not just for the two of them. Sooner rather than later, one of the recent spate of state laws prohibiting abortion after six weeks\u2019 gestation may have its intended consequence: provoking a ruling by the right-leaning Supreme Court that could further erode, if not eliminate, the rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade. Within the reproductive-justice movement, talk of a post-Roe America is not an if but a when\u2014planning is well under way for how to help women in red states get abortions when the procedure is no longer federally protected. Indeed, with only one abortion clinic per state in six states, you could argue that many Americans are already living in a post-Roe reality. All of which makes Russell\u2019s allegation against Parker a potential chink in the armor of the movement itself\u2014one that could, as an activist put it, \u201creify the narrative that \u2018abortionists abuse women\u2019 simply by providing abortions.\u201dThis isn\u2019t just a theory. Three days after Russell\u2019s essay was published, Life Dynamics, a Texas group known for sending \u201cspies for life\u201d into abortion clinics to try to dig up information that might be used to close them down, reveled in the allegations against Parker, claiming on Twitter that it had proof that \u201cthousands of women have been sexually assaulted or raped by abortionists. Some of the abortionists that we documented are still working!\u201dMore recently, Gloria Gray, the owner of a Tuscaloosa, Alabama, clinic where Parker worked last fall, told me that one of her regular protesters had begun making the baseless charge that she was employing a \u201csexual molester\u201d who\u2019d \u201cfondled patients.\u201dWillie Parker and Candice Russell met in 2015, at the Hartford, Connecticut, airport, after attending the annual Civil Liberties and Public Policy conference. The bald-headed, then-52-year-old Parker, who wears round, black-framed glasses and a silver hoop in one ear, had been a featured speaker. The Latina Russell was, at age 32, a \u201cscholarship kid,\u201d as she jokingly puts it\u2014a freelance writer and fledgling activist allowed to attend for free. As she recalls, she sat down at the gate, plunked down her bag, and accidentally bumped Parker. As the two chatted, other conference attendees kept interrupting to take selfies with him.It would be hard to overstate Parker\u2019s prominence within the reproductive-rights movement at the time. He was its most visible male figurehead\u2014indeed, its only one. A black, devoutly Christian ob-gyn born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, Parker spent the first half of his career refusing to perform abortions. Then, in 2003, at the age of 41, he had what he has described as a \u201ccome-to-Jesus moment.\u201d He radically reversed course, becoming not just an abortion provider but, you might say, the abortion provider: a traveling doctor who\u2014eschewing the bulletproof vest favored by some in his high-risk profession\u2014zigzags across the Deep South tending to patients, most of whom are poor women of color, at clinics in Alabama and Mississippi.That was only part of it. Parker posted himself up at the movement\u2019s front line with the same zeal with which he had once handed out religious pamphlets as a born-again teenage preacher. At one event after another, he cast abortion as a moral imperative that ensures a woman\u2019s human right to lead the life she wants to live. This message refashioned the most controversial medical procedure of our time as the Christian thing to do\u2014and gave the abortion-rights community a language it sorely needed. The abortion storytellers\u2019 organization Shout Your Abortion sold T-shirts bearing Parker\u2019s face. The novelist Jodi Picoult modeled a character on him. In 2017, Parker would publish his own book, a memoir called Life\u2019s Work: A Moral Argument for Choice.One reason Parker was so beloved is that he never acted superior. Exalted as he became, he never lost his easy affability or his appetite for conversation; even in the procedure room, he\u2019s known for keeping up a steady stream of comforting small talk. That day in Hartford, he offered to save Russell a seat on the plane\u2014he was in boarding group A; she was in C\u2014which was not unusual. It was Parker being Parker. But to Russell it was a big deal. On the plane, she shared a story she\u2019d written for HuffPost; he compared it to the work of James Baldwin. (She had to Google the name in the airplane bathroom.) Parker told her he was working on his memoir\u2014maybe he could send her some chapters to read? When we met in a Tuscaloosa hotel\u2019s conference room in September, about six months after she posted her essay, Russell relived the thrill of the request: Here was \u201cthe Gloria Steinem of the movement, and he wants to be writing partners?\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cThis is awesome.\u201dRussell\u2019s own come-to-Jesus moment\u2014though she\u2019d never describe it as such\u2014had occurred a couple of years earlier, after she finished a bartending shift at a place she calls \u201cYe Olde Irish Hooters.\u201d When she got into her car and turned on the radio, the news was all about the Texas legislation later known as H.B. 2, which proposed banning abortion after 20 weeks, among other restrictions. This was 2013. State Senator Wendy Davis was soon to become famous for filibustering the bill in her hot-pink Mizunos. Sitting in her car listening, Russell thought, \u201cThey\u2019re talking about abortion like it\u2019s this horrible thing. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dShe drove straight to Austin, 200 miles south, changed into a dress that was in her trunk, and marched into the capitol rotunda, where she waited in line for hours to testify about her abortion before the state Senate. Russell had gotten pregnant after dating her then-boyfriend for only a month and a half and, at 21, had had an abortion without regret\u2014she views the procedure as the key to her future, and her personal freedom. Making her story more powerful, Russell is what anti-abortion activists call an \u201cabortion survivor.\u201d When her mother was 14 and about to have what would have been her third abortion, she decided at the last minute to keep her baby, Candice. Russell\u2019s narrative flipped the pro-life assumption that no one who\u2019d almost been aborted would ever terminate her own pregnancy.Eventually, telling this story\u2014and that of her second abortion, which she had at age 30\u2014became a sort of job for Russell. As a member of the advocacy group We Testify (an arm of the National Network of Abortion Funds), she shared her account with reporters at The New York Times, The Guardian, and CNN.But in 2015, when she met Parker, Russell was still looking for a way into the movement, volunteering at local Texas organizations without gaining much traction, she told me. Curled up in an armchair, Russell looked dramatically different from the bright-eyed, sprightly woman in Facebook photos taken back then. She seemed deeply fatigued, with dark circles under her eyes, and she was noticeably heavier: Russell had had gastric-bypass surgery in 2009, shedding almost 180 pounds to become, at 5 foot 2, a petit size 4. But since the night with Parker, she said, she\u2019d gained some 80 pounds, which she attributed mostly to alcohol. Still, a certain dorm-room girlishness remained, with her chipped black nail polish and black floral dress; flashes of wit and charisma made it easy to imagine the funny, \u201cboisterous\u201d woman Parker says he was initially charmed by.After that flight together, Russell said, Parker became a \u201cvery close and personal friend,\u201d thanks to a bond based on shared childhood trauma. As he wrote in his memoir, Parker and his five siblings grew up on food stamps. Their mother was twice hospitalized after psychotic breaks and eventually was diagnosed with manic depression.Russell\u2019s own mother was a stripper and sometime sex worker, and was addicted to meth and heroin, she says. By the time Russell was a preteen, she had been abandoned to live with her stepfather and two half-siblings. But during a brief reappearance, her mother sold her 12-year-old daughter for sex\u2014one of multiple incidences of sexual abuse in her childhood, Russell says.Russell herself struggles with mental illness, she told me, and in the months leading up to her October 2016 get-together with Parker, she\u2019d been diagnosed with severe PTSD due to childhood trauma. She\u2019d been looking forward to confiding in Parker about this at dinner that night, in fact. On the handful of occasions when they\u2019d met in person, the two had had hours-long conversations, she said, in which she told him \u201cthings I hadn\u2019t even told my [ex-]husband.\u201dListening to Parker describe his relationship with Russell is like listening to a record played backwards: A completely different sound comes out. At 5 foot 11, Parker is barrel-chested and physically imposing, a presence that is offset by his signature collection of professorial bow ties and ascots. But the day we met, at a Manhattan sidewalk caf\u00e9, the city was sweltering, and he wore a crisp button-down, no tie. As he talked, in long blocks of uninterrupted speech, he frequently removed his glasses to mop his brow.What Parker said he knew about Russell, you could learn at a cocktail party: She was from Seattle, had been married, had a stepson she was still in contact with. Their conversations, he said, covered music, the Seattle Seahawks, their activism, Russell\u2019s various jobs\u2014over time, she was appointed to the board of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and hired as an executive assistant by the National Network of Abortion Funds. She \u201cabsolutely\u201d never opened up to him about her childhood trauma or mental-health problems, he said. If she had talked about her mother, he likely would have shared about his own, he added, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have that kind of fluency.\u201d Their interactions were \u201ctoo inconsistent for me to become a close confidant to her,\u201d and he said he never asked her to read his book-in-progress.Parker got married for the first time in August 2018, seven months before Russell posted her story, to a 54-year-old flight attendant with whom he now lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. But until then he\u2019d been an object in motion, always on the road for his advocacy or abortion work, finding connection where he could\u2014people he\u2019d grab a bite with when he happened to land in their town. In his mind, the only thing that differentiated Russell from those friends is the fact that on one occasion they\u2019d had sex.Both Parker\u2019s and Russell\u2019s recollections of the night of October 8, 2016, are fragmented\u2014hers, she says, because of alcohol; his, he says, because of the erasure of time. They agree on this: They had dinner at a Cajun restaurant in Dallas, where he\u2019d come for a conference, before heading to a rooftop bar called Happiest Hour. Around midnight, they returned to his hotel and had sex.Parker\u2019s version of the story hinges on a moment\u2014maybe at the bar, he\u2019s not certain\u2014when Russell looked at him and said something along the lines of \u201cThere\u2019s this undeniable chemistry between us. It\u2019s mutual. What are we going to do about it?\u201d This surprised him, he said. He\u2019d found Russell attractive, but they hadn\u2019t seemed destined for anything more than friendship. Still, to him, this was the moment not just of consent but of initiation: She made the first move.In Tuscaloosa, when I repeated this part of Parker\u2019s story to Russell, she practically doubled over in pain. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I talk,\u201d she said, spitting out the words. And even if she had come on to him\u2014which she doesn\u2019t remember doing\u2014she said she was drunk enough that any indication of consent was irrelevant. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I said \u2018Let\u2019s go fuck in the bathroom.\u2019\u200a\u201dIn some ways, Russell\u2019s and Parker\u2019s conflicting views of the night all boil down to this. Russell said Parker could not have missed that she was plastered: She drank a few martinis at dinner, at least one more at the bar, and a whole bottle of wine in his hotel room, and she describes herself as \u201cclumsy\u201d when she drinks. \u201cI sway a lot, fall a lot. I slur. If I\u2019m brownout drunk\u2014so drunk, I\u2019m not remembering\u2014I\u2019m sloppy at that point.\u201dBut Parker, a lifetime teetotaler, said that he didn\u2019t count Russell\u2019s drinks, never saw a bottle of wine in his room, and didn\u2019t witness Russell act as she describes. Removing his glasses to rub his eyes, he recalled her condition using a physician\u2019s parlance: \u201cThere were no slurs, no incoherent thoughts, no motor-function impairment.\u201d Until the Medium post, Russell hadn\u2019t given him an inkling that she thought their night together was anything other than consensual, he said, and the two continued to text periodically. At some point, Russell must have \u201cdecided to feel some other kind of way about\u201d sex she\u2019d agreed to and so reframed it as an \u201cexploitative, predatory thing\u201d\u2014the kind of thing \u201cnobody would question.\u201dWith at least part of this analysis, Russell would concur: She did change her mind. For a long time, she described the encounter to herself and others as \u201cproblematic.\u201d But the more she thought about it, the more that idea began to break apart and reassemble into a different shape. If another woman had told Russell that she\u2019d gotten \u201cbrownout\u201d drunk and had sex, she says, \u201cwould I be calling it \u2018problematic\u2019? No, I would call it rape.\u201dProtesters outside the Supreme Court on the eve of the Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt oral arguments, in March 2016. The case challenged a Texas law that regulated abortion-providing facilities. (Dawn Porter)The day after Russell\u2019s March 25 letter, Parker took to Medium to post a point-by-point rebuttal of her allegations, but that did not keep him from being swiftly disappeared from the movement. On the 26th, he stepped down, under duress, from his position as chair of the board of Physicians for Reproductive Health. He says he was disinvited from four upcoming academic talks and lost his seat on the boards of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and the Abortion Access Front (formerly Lady Parts Justice League), an organization led by the comedian and activist Lizz Winstead, who until then had been one of his closest allies. The National Network of Abortion Funds declared solidarity with accusers, and said it already had been in the process of dropping Parker\u2019s name from one of its two national funds. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue, perhaps the most powerful abortion-rights leader in the country after Cecile Richards resigned in 2018 from the top post at Planned Parenthood, tweeted: \u201cWe #believesurvivors and we believe Candice Russell. Sexual assault does occur in movement spaces, and we should have no tolerance for it.\u201dThe fierce constituency that rose up around Russell demanded no proof. None was necessary. She was one of their own, clearly the David to Parker\u2019s Goliath, the older, richer, more powerful male\u2014the movement \u201crock star\u201d 20 years her senior. To these ardent, instant supporters, the thinking was: Why would anyone do what she did\u2014reveal a humiliating experience, including her own hard drinking, and risk being ostracized by the abortion-rights community for tarring its MVP\u2014unless it was true? What could she possibly have to gain by lying about such a thing?\u201cThat is literally an option of last resort,\u201d says Amanda Reyes, the founder and executive director of Alabama\u2019s Yellowhammer Fund, a reproductive-justice organization that helps pay for abortions in that state. After reading Russell\u2019s Medium post, Reyes wrote to Russell\u2014whom she\u2019d never met\u2014to say I believe you. In recent years, Reyes told me, groups such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL have leaned hard on hashtags like #trustwomen, meaning that we should trust women to make their own decisions about whether to terminate a pregnancy. \u201cIf I do not extend that [same trust] to survivors,\u201d Reyes said, \u201cthen who am I?\u201dAs it happens, Reyes\u2019s belief led to one of the more unlikely plot twists in this story. In June, Reyes offered Russell a job as the deputy director of Yellowhammer, which practically overnight had gone from a shoestring operation to a force to be reckoned with. After Alabama passed the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion ban in May, the group\u2019s bank balance leaped from $5,000 to more than $2 million in just two months, enriched by the online activism of celebrities like Rihanna and Reese Witherspoon.For Russell, the job meant moving to Tuscaloosa to work for an organization whose primary mission is funding abortions in Alabama\u2014including those Parker performs. But she was undeterred: This was a chance to do important work at a level she\u2019d only dreamed of. And her supporters had her back; all summer, the fire Russell had lit continued to rage online, and with increasing vitriol. Why was Parker, \u201ca serial rapist,\u201d even allowed to perform abortions anymore? one activist asked on a Facebook page called #IbelieveCandice. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel safe under his care.\u201dFor all his eloquence on the subject of a woman\u2019s right to choose, Parker is not deft at expressing the emotional impact of his exile, or of such invective. He uses phrases like profound disappointment and moments of pain. But he once offered, piercingly, that the way Russell had written on Medium of his hands all over her had made him sound \u201canimalistic,\u201d like the stereotypical sexualized black man.While Parker says he prefers not to dwell on the racial dimensions of this story\u2014a black man accused of a crime and condemned with no recourse\u2014one of his close friends, the social-justice advocate Wyndi Anderson, believes that on some level he had been steeling himself against this possibility. \u201cIf you grew up in the South, this is what we think black men do\u2014rape women,\u201d says Anderson, who is white and was raised in South Carolina. \u201cAs a black man who has been putting his hands on and in white women and [other] women, he has been waiting for this fucking thing, this charge, since the day he started doing this work.\u201dThe few who did publicly take issue with Russell\u2019s denunciation of Parker were lambasted for victim-blaming, or written off as \u201crape apologists.\u201d The documentary-film maker Dawn Porter, who spent three years in Parker\u2019s orbit while shooting her 2016 film, Trapped, about the diminishing number of abortion clinics in the Deep South, uncorked her outrage on Twitter: \u201cWhat did i miss? You drank 4 martinis and a bottle of wine on your own. Did he force you to do that? You slept with him and you regret it? That makes him a PREDATOR?\u201d Mallory McMaster, one of Russell\u2019s fellow abortion storytellers, fired back: \u201cDawn, your next documentary should follow your abrupt departure from the movement after showing us all that you don\u2019t share our values.\u201dThe notion that a woman who drinks too much is at all responsible for unwanted sex has become verboten in recent years\u2014understandably, because it risks reopening an old window, allowing back in the creeping suspicion that women are in some way to blame when they\u2019re assaulted. But in reality, things get messy. In her Medium post, Russell herself wrote, \u201cIf I had done the right thing, left at the appropriate time, stopped after two drinks like I should have, none of this would have ever happened.\u201d By the time we met six months later she was free of any ambiguity. The fact that Parker was sober figured prominently in her thinking. If they\u2019d both been drunk, the sex would have been \u201cnot great, but not predatory,\u201d in Russell\u2019s estimation. But because he\u2019d had his wits about him and she hadn\u2019t, she said to me, as if addressing Parker directly, \u201cThat\u2019s your bad. You\u2019re a feminist leader and a physician, and you are choosing to count that as consent. That is your mistake. That makes you a predator.\u201dThe law draws no such distinction. These days, we all know that a person cannot consent to sex when incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, but what constitutes incapacitated, exactly? In most states, including Texas, an accuser who drinks of her own volition (versus, say, being roofied) must be fully unconscious\u2014literally unable to resist\u2014to qualify as such. So legally, it doesn\u2019t matter how wasted Russell was\u2014as long as she wasn\u2019t passed-out. Cynthia Godsoe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in gender and sexuality, says the standards in this area are beginning to shift: Under Title IX rules, which govern how colleges address sexual assault on campus, people who are visibly drunk are sometimes considered past the point of consent. And coincidentally, a bill is now pending in the Texas statehouse to expand the definition of sexual assault to include cases of what Godsoe calls \u201cserious drunkenness,\u201d or, in the language of the legislation, cases in which \u201cthe actor knows the other person is intoxicated\u201d to the point that he or she can\u2019t \u201cappraise the nature of the act.\u201dRussell\u2019s drinking, her spotty memory, and her troubled past make her exactly the kind of woman whose account of sexual assault was for generations dismissed without a backwards glance.Of course, defining that level of intoxication isn\u2019t necessarily straightforward, nor is proving that one person knew how drunk another person was. \u201cSome people act sloppy; some don\u2019t,\u201d Godsoe says. \u201cSomeone could drink four martinis and be okay; someone else would not.\u201d The limits of the justice system are one reason the writer Tanya Selvaratnam\u2014who told The New Yorker in 2018 about being domestically abused by then\u2013New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2014last April wrote an op-ed for Glamour backing Russell. For many victims of sexual assault and harassment, Selvaratnam contended, \u201cthe court of public opinion\u201d is the best or only option available. (Schneiderman was never criminally charged.)Post-#MeToo, many people have become comfortable trusting narratives that wouldn\u2019t have been credited before. Christine Blasey Ford recalled her alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh with great specificity and also with occasional imprecision, more than 30 years after the fact\u2014and polls showed that 45 percent of Americans believed her (versus 33 percent who believed Kavanaugh). Andrea Constand recalled an assault during which she had been only half-conscious, thanks to three little blue pills she\u2019d been given by Bill Cosby\u2014and the comedian was convicted of aggravated indecent assault. Russell\u2019s drinking, her spotty memory, and her troubled past make her exactly the kind of woman whose account of sexual harassment or assault was for generations disregarded, dismissed without a backwards glance. What is #believewomen, after all, if you don\u2019t believe this woman?The mounting force of this duty to believe was apparent the week after Russell posted her essay, when two elder stateswomen of the reproductive-justice movement called for due process\u2014and were roundly ignored. In an op-ed, Toni Bond Leonard and Loretta Ross exhorted the abortion-rights community not to rush to judgment, lest they violate Parker\u2019s human rights. \u201cWhat is painfully evident,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis that our lack of process is fracturing the movement, often along racial and generational lines, through a dangerous collision of #MeToo with reproductive justice.\u201d Six months later, not one activist I spoke with had been swayed by this sentiment: The generational divide Leonard and Ross had identified was real, they all told me, and the elders were on the wrong side of it.Ross helped coin the phrase reproductive justice, which emphasizes the needs of marginalized communities (the poor, people of color) and has replaced pro-choice as the dominant framework for abortion-rights activism. From 1979 to 1982, she was the director of the first rape crisis center in the country, in Washington, D.C. \u201cI\u2019m pre-#MeToo,\u201d she told me last fall. No one who\u2019s seen what she has wants to undermine the credibility of survivors, Ross continued, but by the same token, \u201cno reasonable veteran of the anti-rape movement is going to agree that every so-called survivor is absolutely telling the truth. That\u2019s just not true.\u201dAt this time in history, in the circles in which Ross operates, that is an extremely controversial statement, but she didn\u2019t hedge. \u201cA lot of people tell stories through the lens of their trauma that are as real as can be to them. That doesn\u2019t make it the objective truth. While you want to hold that story for that person, you have to be very, very careful what you do with it. Because you have to have other evidence\u2014something to back it up, other than their feelings.\u201dDawn PorterRussell might never have gone public, based on her own telling, were it not for the stories she says she heard about Parker hitting on other drunk or vulnerable women\u2014the \u201cwhispers [that] had become so loud they were more like shouts.\u201d Indeed, her essay reads as an invitation to those who suffered similar harm to join her in publicly naming Parker. That hasn\u2019t happened: No one else has come forward to say she has been sexually assaulted by the doctor.One woman accused Parker of sexually harassing her: Yamani Hernandez, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, who happens to be Russell\u2019s former boss. In a series of tweets in August, Hernandez said that during a 2015 photo op, Parker leaned in and whispered in her ear that \u201che would tell his boys back home I was one of his new honeys.\u201d Later, when those pictures were posted on the group\u2019s Facebook page, and someone joked that they looked like wedding shots, he commented on the photo that he would \u201cdraw [Hernandez] a bath with oil and flowers and rub [her] feet.\u201d When Hernandez then texted him to ask if he wanted to say something to her privately, Parker replied (in communications he shared with me), \u201cAll just jokes, if I was interested in you, you\u2019d have known by now\u201d\u2014a comment intended, she thought, to \u201cknock me down a peg.\u201d (Parker wrote Hernandez in August to say that while he didn\u2019t remember their exchanges the same way she did, he was sorry for \u201cever\u201d offending her. She thanked him for the \u201cimportant step toward repair,\u201d adding that she hoped he would \u201cseek education.\u201d)Russell knew about Parker\u2019s sexually tinged comments to Hernandez, and she says they\u2019re one of the \u201cwhispers\u201d that persuaded her to write her essay. As for the other stories that influenced Russell, I followed up on each, and, among those I could trace, her version had marked differences from the one offered by others.The moment Russell said she was sure she \u201cwasn\u2019t alone\u201d came one evening when she was confiding in a female colleague about Parker. The woman stopped her. \u201cShe said she could finish my story, because it had happened to her best friend,\u201d Russell told me. Specifically, an activist younger than Parker had gotten drunk past the point of consent and had sex with him. When I spoke with this colleague, however, she said that while she believes Russell is telling the truth about her own experience, she\u2019d told Russell only that she\u2019d heard other \u201cshady\u201d things about Parker\u2014and she\u2019d been alluding only to inappropriate remarks he\u2019d made to a friend.Russell collected another piece of damning information, she said, at a 2017 conference called Let\u2019s Talk About Sex, held a year or so after her encounter with Parker. There, another higher-up in the movement (who declined to be interviewed) said to her, \u201cOh, you must be one of Willie\u2019s girls.\u201d To Russell, this suggested that reproductive-rights power players knew that Parker took advantage of young women and weren\u2019t doing anything about it. How many other victims are out there? she thought.Cherisse Scott, the founder and CEO of a Memphis reproductive-justice organization called SisterReach, told me she made a \u201cWillie\u2019s girls\u201d\u2013like comment in front of Russell at that conference, but her intention was close to the opposite of Russell\u2019s interpretation. Watching Parker and Russell sitting together at a table near the hotel bar\u2014the pair\u2019s only in-person meeting after their encounter\u2014Scott got the impression that Russell was irritated when other women tried to join them. (Russell, meanwhile, said she was just trying to be \u201ccordial\u201d with Parker because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make a scene\u201d in public.) At the time, Scott, who is African American, thought Russell was white, which to her put the physician at risk. In a country where black men have \u201chistorically been fetishized by white women,\u201d she wrote in an email to me, \u201che could easily become \u2018Native Son.\u2019\u200a\u201d Scott determined to intervene, with a light touch. \u201cDr. Parker,\u201d she recalled exclaiming as she approached their table, \u201cyou are always holding court. The girls know they love them some Willie Parker!\u201d After Russell left the table, Scott warned Parker to be careful\u2014which at the time he considered unnecessary, he told me, because he was confident in his ability to handle himself with women.Russell said she was finally moved to divulge her story by at least two people who mentioned that they\u2019d seen, or heard tales of, Parker \u201csidling up\u201d to unidentified young women at conferences. She wouldn\u2019t disclose the name of one of those people, however, because the story was told to her in confidence. The second person, a board member of a reproductive-rights group, told me that while he believes and supports Russell, he didn\u2019t remember telling her this\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of such behavior anyway, he said, because he was never around Parker.In Tuscaloosa, Russell showed me a video clip that someone had forwarded to her before she wrote her letter. It showed Parker dancing at a conference, \u201chumping somebody to some stupid \u201990s slow jam,\u201d as she described it\u2014proof that he\u2019d become \u201cbrazen, emboldened,\u201d and had to be stopped. The video is 15 seconds long, and shot from a distance. In pink light, on a small platform in the middle of a dance floor, Parker is dancing surrounded by five women, maybe more; it\u2019s hard to tell. He\u2019s the outlier, older than the rest and, well, male. With his shirtsleeves rolled up and his bow tie undone, he looks exactly the way one activist described him to me: \u201clike your fun uncle,\u201d right before last call at a wedding.At the eight-second mark, Russell jabbed a finger at the screen. \u201cDo you see that?\u201d Revulsion was thick in her voice. \u201cHis hand, it\u2019s on her hip. He\u2019s practically grinding on her.\u201dWe replayed it, twice. I strained. I squinted. Did Parker\u2019s hand graze the woman\u2019s hip? Maybe. Though to me, it looked like he was worried she was about to fall off the platform and was reaching out to catch her. I began to get the surreal sense that Russell and I were watching two different videos: Mine was benign; hers was evidence of predatory behavior.Beyond trying to track down the leads Russell gave me, I contacted numerous members of the reproductive-rights field to ask: Was Parker\u2019s bad behavior an open secret in their world? The overwhelming majority of people I spoke with, many of them Russell\u2019s own allies, said they had never heard anything untoward about Parker before her Medium piece. There were two exceptions. Laurie Bertram Roberts, a co-founder of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, told me that a year before Russell posted her story, another woman had disclosed that she\u2019d had sex with Parker when she was too drunk to consent and considered it rape. Parker denied this, and Bertram Roberts would not ask the woman to speak with me; doing so, she argued, would only retraumatize her. In addition, Bertram Roberts said four women have told her Parker made comments that made them feel \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d along the lines of what he said to Hernandez; Bertram Roberts would not share their names or any specifics.Separately, a former journalist who covers reproductive rights (and asked not to be identified because he didn\u2019t think it was his place as a \u201ccisgender man\u201d to get too involved) said that before Russell\u2019s Medium post, two female activists had mentioned to him that Parker \u201chad a reputation\u201d for taking advantage of young women at conferences. Both of his sources declined to be contacted, so it\u2019s impossible to know whether they were talking about what happened with the two women already on the record\u2014Russell and Hernandez\u2014or other women. (Parker said that none of this is true.)Before Russell\u2019s story went live, Bertram Roberts said a rumor was widely circulating that an abortion provider had sexually assaulted someone in the movement. Later, she realized the gossip was about Russell. So again, were there many women with stories to tell about Willie Parker? Or were the stories of Russell and Hernandez gaining momentum as they reverberated in the tight-knit community?Even if that\u2019s the case, Bertram Roberts told me that she doesn\u2019t think Parker should be let off the hook. Take Russell\u2019s rape allegation out of the equation\u2014what\u2019s a man like Parker doing in bed with a woman like Russell in the first place? she asked. A 41-year-old queer woman, Bertram Roberts is also something of a rock star in the movement; she knows what it\u2019s like when these \u201c18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds\u201d run up and ask to take a selfie. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all doe-eyed,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I just sit and talk to you? Can I come hang out in your room?\u201d Her answer, invariably, is \u201cHell no.\u201d Refusing to bask in that kind of abject admiration, she says, \u201cis an ethical choice.\u201dParker considers this a false equivalency. When he and Russell met, she wasn\u2019t 19; she was 32. \u201cI\u2019m still questioning what authority I had over Candice, even if she says \u2018I looked up to you as a hero,\u2019\u200a\u201d Parker told me, shaking his head stubbornly. Such reasoning, he contended, strips women of sexual agency. Any woman who admires his work\u2014or for that matter, any woman who admires a man who is richer, more successful, better-looking\u2014\u201cis unable to give consent?\u201d If it\u2019s a question of age, \u201chow old would Candice have to be to assert herself toward me, and for me to be able to say yes without being regarded as [having] preyed upon her?\u201dLeft: Parker outside the Supreme Court in March 2016 (Dawn Porter). Right: Russell speaking at a reproductive-justice event at the Texas capitol building in 2015 (Trust Respect Access Coalition).Two weeks after I got home from Alabama, I learned that friends of Russell\u2019s had become worried about her mental health. Increasingly anxious to provide proof for this story, and claiming that it was a hit piece on her, she had begun to lean on people to back up her narrative, including one woman who told me Russell had asked her to say that she\u2019d overheard conversations she had not. (After two days of interviews in Alabama, Russell did not answer any further questions from me or the magazine.)What happened in the hotel room with Parker, we\u2019ll never truly know. But in the course of reporting this story, I couldn\u2019t help but think that Russell may have confabulated or exaggerated her version of the ensuing drama. The generous view is that, at an exceedingly vulnerable time, Russell heard what she needed to hear, mistaking, for instance, a comment about \u201cshady\u201d behavior as a sign of corroboration. The less generous view is that, out of either a growing sense of desperation or malevolence, she made up parts of the story.When pieces of a story are not true, what does that mean for the whole? I\u2019ve wondered what would have happened if, from the beginning, Russell had simply stuck to her own account of her experience with Parker and left out the rumors about other women. Whatever you believe about the truth of it, it\u2019s at least, in the vernacular of #MeToo, \u201cher story to tell.\u201d Of course, Russell may have written about many women being harmed by Parker because she thought there were many. But also, maybe, she did not think it was enough to talk about a single, relatively powerless woman: Candice Russell.Coming forward has clearly been painful and destabilizing for Russell, as it has been for many women who have alleged sexual harassment or assault. Although the online chorus was mostly on her side, she took the doubt expressed by revered leaders such as Ross as a hostile attack. But it was when she described other blowback to her Medium piece that her inability to support her claims became most conspicuous. Russell told me that her website was flooded with \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of emails declaring that the blood of the women of Alabama and Mississippi would be on her hands. But when I asked to see some of them, she said they\u2019d been lost after her website was hacked. Russell said Ross called her a \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201ca stripper with a $75,000-a-year salary\u201d on social media, but she couldn\u2019t show me the posts because they\u2019d been eliminated\u2014perhaps by an internet \u201cscrub\u201d company, she added darkly. (Ross denies harassing Russell online, dismissing her claims as \u201cdelusional and self-serving.\u201d)Russell did show me screenshots of three threatening text messages\u2014\u201cNobody will ever believe the daughter of a $2 crack whore,\u201d one reads\u2014but they looked somehow off to me, so I showed them to a digital-forensics expert. He said that the font didn\u2019t look like a standard Apple one, and the file had been saved in an unusual format, using the now-defunct software Picasa\u2014which raises questions: If Russell had captured these on her phone, why would they have gone through extra editing and storage software? It\u2019s extremely difficult to tell when a text has been doctored, and I have no way of knowing whether these were, but the expert told me that he\u2019d be \u201cconcerned about the authenticity of the images.\u201dComing forward has clearly been painful and destabilizing for Russell, as it has been for many women who have alleged sexual harassment or assault.One friend of Russell\u2019s, Robin Marty, the author of Handbook for a Post-Roe America, believes it was Parker\u2019s own Medium essay that led him to be so completely ostracized from the movement. Had Parker recognized the power disparity between himself and Russell; had he said something like \u201cI did not realize at the time how those actions were perceived by you\u2014I am going to look at how I have done things and see if there are things that I can change within my own life,\u201d the outcome might have been different. Instead, he indulged in textbook \u201cgaslighting,\u201d she says, treating a woman as if it was all in her head.When I shared Marty\u2019s language with Parker, however, he was unmoved. Russell was blatantly fabricating, he said. So, on principle, he could not accept responsibility for harm\u2014not even if doing so would somehow restore him to his former prominence. \u201cNot even to make this go away,\u201d he told me firmly.Even if Parker had managed to sound more humble\u2014or more evolved, as Marty might put it\u2014he probably wouldn\u2019t have helped himself much. Grassroots activists told me that the stain of doubt Russell\u2019s charges put on Parker immediately rendered his presence untenable at meetings and conferences, particularly because they\u2019re valued as \u201csafe spaces\u201d for people who are regularly subject to ugly threats. These female activists, many of them volunteers, many of them young, arguably keep the fight for reproductive rights afloat. Who could risk alienating them?Jodi Magee, the longtime president of Physicians for Reproductive Health, whose board Parker chaired, refused to disclose details of confidential deliberations about him. But she did say that, in the Trump-Pence era, with \u201cstate legislators coming after us every single day,\u201d her job is to keep the wheels on the bus, so to speak. I took that to mean: Keep the organization above reproach, so that it can stay on task and avoid throwing red meat to anti-abortion forces.This past fall, when no one else had accused Parker of sexual violence, Tanya Selvaratnam told me she felt compelled to revise her post for Glamour. It weighed on her that the doctor had been banished seemingly with no \u201cdue process.\u201d She wrote: \u201cI believe in investigating allegations. If we don\u2019t establish the veracity of the allegations and the credibility of the accuser, if we don\u2019t distinguish between men behaving badly versus men committing horrific acts against women and causing lifelong trauma, we do the #metoo movement a great disservice.\u201dSuch calls for due process, though, give rise to the question: Due process administered by whom, exactly, and how? In June, the leaders of some 30 abortion-rights organizations gathered in Washington, D.C., to discuss, in part, how the movement might handle complaints of sexual misconduct in the future. Though the deliberations were off the record, Fatima Goss Graves, the president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which helped convene the meeting, told me that the overarching goal wasn\u2019t \u201cdue process,\u201d a criminal-law standard established to protect the accused, but \u201cfair processes\u201d for the accused and the accuser, like those used in workplaces. What this means practically for a movement made up of interwoven but independent groups is hard to fathom, but Goss Graves said it was unlikely that a central entity might be formed to resolve complaints. All she would say is that the first step is to make sure that every organization, large or small, informs its employees and volunteers that if they\u2019re harassed\u2014whether at the office or at a meeting or an event\u2014\u201cwe want to know about it.\u201d\u201cI would prefer to have been accused of murder,\u201d Parker says, \u201cbecause there would have been some effort at due process.\u201dThere is no evidence that the conflict over Parker, or his sidelining, seriously damaged the abortion-rights cause. But it did open up one more rift in a movement that some see as already full of them, at an extremely risky time for the future of abortion access. At Planned Parenthood, Cecile Richards\u2019s successor, Leana Wen, was pushed out in July because, Wen has said, she wanted to focus more on health-care delivery than politics; the organization blames her \u201cleadership and management style.\u201d According to an investigation published by The New York Times in December, amid record-breaking fundraising stoked by states\u2019 passage of stringent anti-abortion bills, various factions in the movement are clashing over issues such as how to allocate resources to ensure that poor women get the services they need.Recommended ReadingThe Dishonesty of the Abortion DebateCaitlin FlanaganThe Day After RoeJeffrey RosenTwins, Separated at Birth, Reunite as AdultsEmily BuderWhen Parker published his memoir in 2017, it was praised by feminist luminaries from Gloria Steinem to Lena Dunham to bell hooks. Richards, then still at the helm of Planned Parenthood, called it \u201ca beacon of hope\u201d that would \u201cchange lives,\u201d writing: \u201cAt Planned Parenthood, our motto is \u2018Care, no matter what\u2019\u2014words that might as well have been written with Dr. Willie Parker in mind.\u201d In November, when I asked Richards to talk about the fate of the man who for two and a half years was employed as the medical director of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., she declined to comment.That day in New York Parker told me, \u201cI would prefer to have been accused of murder, because there would have been some effort at due process.\u201d While Russell\u2019s allies argue that Parker emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed\u2014he can still practice medicine, after all\u2014to him the loss of his advocacy role has been crushing. That is what \u201callowed me to live my core values,\u201d he said, \u201cto be a person of integrity.\u201dRussell, too, has lost the work she loved. In mid-October, Yellowhammer released a statement that praised her work and dedication but announced that she had resigned \u201cto pursue other interests outside of the reproductive rights and justice\u201d arena. Russell had predicted this outcome when we talked. Because of the controversy around her, Russell believed that Yellowhammer was being shut out of important conversations in the movement. Leaving, she said, \u201cwill break my heart, but at some point it\u2019s going to be a choice I have to make.\u201dThe same month Russell resigned, Parker flew to Los Angeles to attend a reproductive-medicine conference he\u2019d been invited to by a fellow physician, a gathering at which he\u2019d spoken several times in the past. He hadn\u2019t preregistered, and when he showed up at the hotel where the event was taking place, he was told to wait\u2014someone would be down shortly to check him in. He waited in the lobby for three and a half hours. Friends, passing through, expressed sympathy, but none took on the task of fighting to get him in. Eventually, he gave up and returned to his hotel room. The next morning, he flew home.This article appears in the March 2020 print edition with the headline \u201cThe Abortion Doctor and His Accuser.\u201dMaggie Bullock is a freelance writer based in Amherst, Massachusetts."
