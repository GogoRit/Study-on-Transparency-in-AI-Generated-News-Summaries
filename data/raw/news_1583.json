Wade.\nHealth clinics, including Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, Women\u2019s Med Group Professional Corp., Toledo Women\u2019s Center and Pre-Term Cleveland, will argue the injunction should stand as a referendum heads for voters ballots in November.\nAttorney General Dave Yost appealed the case after a lower court said the preliminary injunction could stand, despite arguments from the state that the court did not have the jurisdiction to do so. The First District Court of Appeals also ruled that Ohio couldn\u2019t appeal the decision of the Hamilton County court, leading the AG\u2019s office to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.\nThe state attorney, who said the appeals court created a precedent to allow trial courts \u201cto hold state laws hostage,\u201d is asking the high court to both allow the appeal, and allow the 6-week ban to be put back in place, as it was in effect \u201cfor months\u201d before the state was sued to stop the ban from continuing.\nPro-abortion groups on the other side of the lawsuit argue the abortion ban should not be in place, and that the Hamilton County court preserved the \u201cstatus quo\u201d by putting a stop to the abortion ban while the case winds itself through the courts.\nIn the most recent brief to the court, the AG\u2019s office expressed concern about abortions that could take place in the time it takes for the case to run its course.\n\u201cThe State may legislate to protect innocent life,\u201d Solicitor General Benjamin Flowers wrote on behalf of AG Dave Yost. \u201cThe injunction interferes with the state\u2019s ability to do so.\u201d\nThe state attorneys claimed the \u201cstatus quo\u201d argument shouldn\u2019t stand because \u201cthe state of abortion law has been vigorously contested ever since\u00a0Roe v. Wade,\u201d despite the fact that the 1970s decision was not overturned until 2022.\n\u201cSo if the plaintiffs are right about the best way to define status quo, the relevant status quo occurred during the many years predating Roe, when no one imagined the Constitution guaranteed a right to abortion,\u201d Flowers wrote for the state.\nThe state eschewed an argument that the six-week abortion ban \u201cis not the best way for the state to go about promoting its interest in protecting innocent life,\u201d saying it \u201chas no bearing on the question whether the injunction here interferes with the state\u2019s prerogative to protect innocent life in accordance with validly enacted state laws.\u201d\n\u201cThat \u2026 is a policy question for the legislature,\u201d the AG\u2019s office wrote.\nAbortion rights groups go into the oral arguments with the backing of medical groups, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Academy of Medicine of Cleveland & Northern Ohio.\nThe groups filed their own brief with the state supreme court arguing abortion is a valid medical procedure, used not only for terminations of pregnancies but also for treatment of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies that are already consider inviable and a threat to the pregnant person\u2019s health.\nThe medical professionals in the groups told the court they feared physicians would be subject to all sorts of penalties, legal and disciplinary, if the General Assembly-enacted law was allowed to remain in place.\nThe national and Ohio chapter of the National Association of Social Workers also wrote an argument against the ban to the court, decrying \u201cgovernment interference\u201d in individual medical decisions.\nA letter from 18 conservative state attorneys general, helmed by Lynn Fitch of Mississippi \u2013 the state of origin for the Dobbs case \u2013 backed Ohio\u2019s Attorney General and the re-implementation of the six-week ban.\nBallot initiative court battle\nThe November referendum is facing its own challenge in the Ohio Supreme Court, as a former state House Representative and anti-abortion advocates are attempting to block the measure from getting to voters. In the lawsuit, the challengers claim the ballot measure does not comply with state laws only allowing one issue per constitutional amendment.\nThe ballot initiative received nearly 500,000 valid voter signatures in support before the July 5 deadline, clearing the way for it to appear on the ballot, according to the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\nSecretary of State Frank LaRose was represented by the state AG\u2019s office in a brief for that case, saying he \u201ctakes no position on the merits\u201d of the challenge, \u201cother than to respectfully request that the court resolve the dispute between (the parties) as quickly as possible, so that the secretary and the 88 county boards of elections may administer the November 7, 2023, General Election, on which ballot the proposed initiative would appear, without delay.\u201d\nBallot initiative creators and supporters pointed to the certification of the ballot measure by both the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the verification of the language by the Ohio Ballot Board, which is led by LaRose, and the collection and verification of the 495,000 signatures as argument that the initiative should be allowed to carry on.\n\u201cThe subject matter of this case stirs strong passions in Ohioans with different views,\u201d Columbus attorney Don McTigue wrote to the court on behalf of the abortion rights supporters. \u201cThe ballot box \u2014 not this Court \u2014 is the proper forum for determining whether the Amendment will become law upon the approval of Ohioans, or whether (challengers) and others who share their views will instead succeed in persuading the voters to support their position and reject the Amendment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXOhio Supreme Court sets date for arguments in abortion appeal\nby Susan Tebben, Ohio Capital Journal August 11, 2023\nOhio Supreme Court sets date for arguments in abortion appeal\nby Susan Tebben, Ohio Capital Journal August 11, 2023\n Update 8/14/23 \u2013\u00a0The Ohio Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit attempting to block the abortion ballot initiative from heading to the November general election.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nThe Ohio Supreme Court will hear arguments next month in a case regarding the indefinitely paused six-week abortion ban as it also decides whether to intervene in the November abortion ballot initiative process.\nThe state\u2019s highest court set oral arguments for Sept. 27, when the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office will make their case as to why they appealed a preliminary injunction from a Hamilton County court, putting a temporary stop to the six-week abortion ban implemented hours after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v.
