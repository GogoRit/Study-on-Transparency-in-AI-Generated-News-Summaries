Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid,\u201d Guterres said in a speech to The New School in New York.\nHe said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were being diluted or rolled back and that in 34 countries rape within marriage was still legal.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong and relentless pushback against women\u2019s rights,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cWomen\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights are under threat from different sides.\u201d\nLanguage promoting women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health is long-agreed internationally, including in resolutions adopted by the Security Council in 2009 and 2013 and several resolutions adopted annually by the 193-member General Assembly.\nHowever, the United States under Trump has pushed to remove such language from new UN resolutions. The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the UN. Population Fund because it believed it was linked to an abortion program, but the UN said that was an inaccurate perception.\nThe US Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that women have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion but the issue is still divisive in the United States.\n\u201cThe UN should not put itself in a position of promoting or suggesting a right to abortion, whether it is humanitarian or development work,\u201d US Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said in October.\nThe United States has received support for its stance from countries including Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Guatemala, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan, Uganda, Poland and Hungary.\n\u201cI find it pretty strange that the United States is mobilizing so hard on this issue \u2026 because if you look at the bigger picture is the main threat to the world today abortions? Or is it an assertive China? A Russia that is expansionist? Let\u2019s just get our focus right here,\u201d said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nLast year Washington threatened to veto a Security Council resolution if a reference was not cut citing the need for UN bodies and donors to give timely \u201csexual and reproductive health\u201d assistance to survivors of sexual violence in conflict.\nGuterres said on Thursday he would urge governments to achieve gender parity in senior leadership. He said he achieved gender parity among his senior leadership team \u2013 on Jan. 1, 90 women and 90 men were in the ranks of full-time senior leadership, two years ahead of the target date he set.\n\u201cWomen have equaled and outperformed men in almost every sphere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to stop trying to change women and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential.\u201d\n \n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebookTwitter\n\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsAppEmailCopy \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\nantonio guterres\n\n\ninequality\n\n\nwomen's rights\n\n\n2/28/20 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWoman dies after 'one sip' of wine spiked with MDMA\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Concerts\n\n\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post\n\n\n\t\t\tGet seats.
