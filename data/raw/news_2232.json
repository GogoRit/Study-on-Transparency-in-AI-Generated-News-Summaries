Her doctors advised her to abort the child because, they said, \u201cthe baby would be born with some disability.\u201d A devout Catholic, Edi Bocelli refused, but the doctors\u2019 prognosis was correct. Her son Andrea was born with congenital glaucoma and was completely blind by age 12.\u00a0\nDespite being unable to see, Andrea was born with other gifts. One, in particular, stands out. His voice has been called \u201cthe most beautiful in the world.\u201d According to Celine Dion, \u201cif God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli.\u201d\nIn fact, Bocelli\u2019s albums have sold over 90 million copies. His 1999 album \u201cSacred Arias,\u201d is the biggest selling album by a solo classical artist in history, and his 1996 single, Con te partir\u00f2 (\u201cWith You I Shall Leave\u201d) is one of the biggest selling singles of all time, putting him on a list that includes Lady Gaga, Maroon 5, and Adele. Bocelli has sung for presidents, prime ministers, and popes. He was even named one of the world\u2019s \u201cFifty Most Beautiful People\u201d by People Magazine.\nIn 2010, Bocelli told his mother\u2019s story in a video entitled \u201cAndrea Bocelli\u2014His Unknown Story That Touches Hearts.\u201d Sitting at the piano, after describing his mother\u2019s decision to not abort him, he adds, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m partisan, but I can say that it was the right choice.\u201d\u00a0\nBocelli told an Italian newspaper\u00a0that he was inspired to share his story by a missionary in Haiti who works with children and women facing difficult pregnancies. \u201cBecause of my personal convictions as a devout Catholic,\u201d said Bocelli, \u201cI am not only fighting against something, I am fighting for something \u2013 and I am for life.\u201d\nThe video went viral. Bocelli said he hopes it will \u201chelp comfort those who are in difficult situations and who sometimes just need to feel that they are not alone.\u201d In this way, Bocelli\u2019s story is reminiscent of the important work of pregnancy care centers, which also exist to remind women facing a difficult pregnancy that they are not alone. The comfort and support they provide helps women choose life, just as Bocelli\u2019s mother did.\nEspecially at this time of year, Bocelli\u2019s story reminds us of the part a challenging pregnancy played in the story of our redemption. It\u2019s easy for us to forget that God gave Mary the option to say \u201cno.\u201d Her reply, \u201cmay it be done according to thy will,\u201d are similar to the words that Edi Bocelli and countless other women have echoed throughout the ages.\u00a0\nAnd here\u2019s just a small sample of \u201cthe most beautiful voice in the world,\u201d Andrea Bocelli singing, \u201cGlory to You, Christ Jesus, you will reign today and forever. Glory to you, you who will soon come!\u201d\nGlory to you, Christ Jesus,\nyou will reign today and for ever\nGlory to you! You will soon come;\nyou alone are our hope!\n\nThe Colson Center team has prepared a free downloadable and beautifully illustrated e-book, \u201cEmmanuel! Readings for Advent.\u201d It\u2019s available at BreakPoint.org.\nAnd, by the way, Andrea Bocelli is holding a Christmas concert, to be streamed online around the world, on December 12. It\u2019s available on pay-per view.
