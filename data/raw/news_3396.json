The Archdiocese of Denver, Colorado Catholic Conference and Catholic Charities of Denver speak in unison against the inhumane and radical legislation that hurts women and unborn children.\n\u201cThis HB-1279 violates the fundamental human right to life for millions of pre-born children,\u201d said Brittany Vessely, executive director of the Colorado Catholic Conference, the state bishops\u2019 public policy organization. \u201cAnd it is out-of-touch with the desires of millions of Colorado voters.\u201d\nIf enacted, the bill will permit abortion-on-demand for any reason, remove parental rights to receive notification of a minor receiving an abortion, permit abortion discrimination based on sex or race or ability level, and remove all rights under law for a fertilized egg, embryo or fetus. Read more about the legislation here.\nAll people opposed to radical abortion are invited to attend a public rally in opposition to the bill starting at 11 a.m. Saturday, March 12, at the Colorado State Capitol in downtown Denver.\nThis radical legislation is proposed in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health, which could overturn Roe v. Wade, the legalization of abortion in 1973, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\nAlthough Colorado was the first state to legalize abortion in 1967, a great number of residents oppose abortion and late-term abortion. In 2020, nearly 1.3 million Coloradans voted for Proposition 115 that would have prohibited abortion after 22-weeks gestation in most situations. Meanwhile pro-abortion advocates are positioning Colorado as an \u201cabortion destination\u201d for other states with pro-life legislation.- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nMany women have spoken\u00a0about their personal experience with abortion and subsequent change of heart for life. They each received medical care, baby items,\u00a0emotional support\u00a0through Marisol Health, a medical clinic and social services outreach under\u00a0Catholic Charities of Denver that helps women establish a life with their children. In addition, affordable housing, food, early childhood education, counseling and parent\u00a0support groups are offered to\u00a0assist women\u00a0through Catholic Charities\u2019 multitude of services.\nKendall first discovered Marisol Health after searching for help on Google.\n\u201cAfter I had my first pregnancy and abortion, I thought I would feel this overwhelming sense of relief and it was the complete the opposite,\u201d shared Kendall, who was in college when she experienced an unexpected pregnancy. \u201cI was devastated for a very long time. It took me a lot of work and prayers to get to the place to tolerate my decision. The biggest thing when it comes to abortion is to know that it\u2019s not the easy way out.\u201d\nLocal mom Denisa, who has two children, said she also felt fear when facing unexpected pregnancies but later regretted her abortions and going to an abortion facility for help.\n\u201cI was going to go have an abortion across the street at Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Denisa before she went to Marisol Health\u2019s clinic for medical services\u00a0and support. \u201cI would also go there because to me it was a quick way to solve a problem. With Planned Parenthood, they don\u2019t emotionally care why you want to get an abortion. They don\u2019t ask you, \u2018Are you sure certain? How are you feeling?\u2019 You don\u2019t really get over abortion. It\u2019s something I carry every day.\u201d\nLearn more about Marisol Health at marisolhealth.com.\n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinPinterestEmailPrintCopy URL\n\n\n\n\nPrevious articleWATCH: Archbishop Aquila and Archdiocese of Denver leadership share status updateNext articleNeeded: An Ecumenical Reset\n\nDenver Catholic Staff\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\nFeast Days  \n\nBake St. Joseph\u2019s Bread for the Solemnity\n\n\nMarch 19, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nNew recreation center for St. John Vianney seminarians breaks ground\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Archdiocese  \n\nPHOTOS | St. John Vianney Seminary celebrates 25 years with special Mass\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n \n\nPrepare your hearts for Easter joy at a Lenten Penance Service\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhy get married in a church?\n\n\nMarch 11, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day: History, spirituality and traditions\n\n\nMarch 15, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nFacebookInstagramTwitter\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nLea nuestra publicaci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol \n\n\n\nEditor's Pick\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGeorge Weigel\nThe good news is that the bad news isn\u2019t all the news there is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAround the Archdiocese\nPerpetual adoration chapels abound in the Archdiocese of Denver.
