The ad ran on October 28 in six newspapers in swing-states and featured the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barett to the Supreme Court as its major threat. It reads, \u201cAfter the rushed confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in the midst of a pandemic, we now face a Supreme Court that puts our health and freedoms, including our right to safe and legal abortion, at extreme risk.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood and the celebrities stamping their names on its messaging continue to contradict their claim of supporting women. In reality they feel threatened by a woman \u2014 a woman who is successful, qualified and a dedicated mom \u2014 all because she is pro-life. By this mindset, telling women to pursue their dreams or success only applies if you support abortion.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, the ad\u2019s appeal to the pandemic and \u201csafe\u201d abortions is inconsistent and inconsiderate as abortion clearly does not cure COVID and the shameless promotion of \u201cat home abortions\u201d has put the safety of women at risk for easy financial gain in this difficult time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is a common trend for pro-abortion musicians, such as when Eilish also donated concert funds to Planned Parenthood and then endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign: the most pro-abortion ticket America has ever faced.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCelebrities play a dangerous game in their love affair with Planned Parenthood. These men and women are often the role models of our children but buy into the lies of an industry that gets more radical by the day.\u00a0 They have yet to find out though that the young people of the Pro-Life Generation are not swayed by a movement merely because it\u2019s popular, but fearlessly stand up for innocent lives because it\u2019s right.\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,181\n\nShare this postJessica Nardi\nBlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolPlanned ParenthoodSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
