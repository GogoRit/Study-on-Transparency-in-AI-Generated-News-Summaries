Authorities should promote racial and reproductive justice and address stark racial disparities in health outcomes.\n\u201cWe reviewed more than 100 heat and climate change adaptation plans or associated documents but found only a couple of references to pregnancy,\u201d said Skye Wheeler, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cPregnant people, and especially Black and brown people, need to be at the table as we tackle the multiple harms to health from increasing heat.\u201dA Better Balance, the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative, Human Rights Watch, the National Birth Equity Collaborative, and the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice-Florida released today a fact sheet, \u201cIncreasing Temperatures because of the Climate Change Crisis is a Reproductive Justice Issue in the United States.\u201d Reproductive Justice is a global movement created by Black women\u2019s rights activists in the US. It seeks to ensure the human right to legal and equitable access to comprehensive, high quality reproductive health services, and a healthy and safe environment for all women during pregnancy and while raising children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Fact Sheet: Increasing Temperatures because of the Climate Change Crisis is a Reproductive Justice Issue in the United States\n      \n\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch reviewed 105 official heat safety web pages, climate action plans, heat plans, heat advisories, disaster plans, and sustainability initiatives for 18 large US cities, including the 15 most populous, with a total of 32 million people. As of August 2020, only two of these documents, from Chicago and Philadelphia, explicitly addressed the danger heat poses during pregnancy. Since the review was conducted, Human Rights Watch has seen that New York City has also included this group in a list of vulnerable populations. Concerns about the dangers of heat for pets were found 37 times.\nA\u00a0Buzzfeed article\u00a0from August also found that\u00a0out of 25 US cities, only Chicago and Philadelphia mentioned pregnancy in public heat guidelines.\nHeat-related illnesses range from heat rashes and cramps to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which is a medical emergency and can be fatal or cause permanent disability. Every year, more people die in the US from heat than from any other weather-related cause, and the number of heat-related deaths is increasing. Heat stress threatens health during pregnancy and fetal health exposure to high temperatures results in higher rates of premature birth as well as other adverse birth outcomes.\nBecause of systemic racism, Black women and other women of color in the US face dramatically worse pregnancy health and birth outcomes than white women. Some studies suggest that Black pregnant women may be especially vulnerable to the emerging threat of heat. Women of color and low-income women may also face more hours of dangerous heat, because they work in hot conditions \u2013 for example about one-fifth of US farmworkers are women \u2013 or because they live in parts of cities with less green space and higher average temperatures.\nThe 2020 summer was hotter than usual, a trend that is expected to continue, although some parts of the US have had bigger heat increases than others in the past decades. Predictions for extreme increases in heat by the end of the century can only be mitigated by rapid action to cut carbon emitted into the atmosphere. Regardless, temperatures are set to rise significantly in much of the US because of increased carbon, already present because of past emissions.\nCity studies of local dangers of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, flooding, or heat waves, and local climate change action plans did often note, correctly, that the impact of climate change varies greatly between individuals and communities. Many said that older people, people with pre-existing conditions such as heart and respiratory disease, as well as athletes and children, are especially vulnerable to illness and death from extreme heat.\nSome plans or warnings cited outdoor workers as an at-risk group. There is no federal heat standard protecting US workers from extreme heat, although laws protecting access to cooling or water, shade, and rest in at least some circumstances are in place in California, Minnesota, and Washington states. An incomplete but increasing number of states provide accommodations for pregnant workers such as additional water breaks. In September 2020, the US House of Representatives passed a federal bill, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, that would provide explicit protections nationally, though it remains pending in the Senate.\nSome climate change or heat plans reviewed discussed how low-income communities, communities with less access to air conditioning, or communities of color are more likely to be hit harder by heat or other extreme weather. Most did not include recommendations to address racial inequities and racism as part of the response to the climate crisis, although some did. Scholars, climate activists, and public health officials have cited these inequities and said that local plans addressing climate change should be as inclusive as possible.\nA 2020 study estimated that there may have been 12,000 heat-related deaths a year during the last decade in the contiguous US and warned that the number could increase to 110,000 a year under high-emission \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenarios by the year 2100. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not published complete data on heat-related deaths over the last decade; from 1999 to 2010 it recorded around 618 heat-related deaths every year. But because the recorded cause of death is often another health event, such as a heart attack, this is an underestimation.\nMany studies show that heat exposure is linked to premature birth and others also link exposure to heat to low birth weight, birth defects, and stillbirth. Several reviews of studies warn that more needs to be done to address these findings, especially given predictions of hotter days and nights as well as acute heat wave periods. Premature birth is a leading cause of infant death and linked to higher rates of lifelong intellectual and physical health problems. Premature birth can also create a heavy financial and emotional toll on families.\nThe rates of premature births in the US grew for a fifth year in a row in 2019. The CDC says that Black women\u2019s pregnancies end in premature birth 50 percent more often than those of white women. Low birth weight is also twice as common among babies born to Black women, and stillbirth is more than twice as common for Black women as for white women. The March of Dimes, which fights premature birth in the US, provides analysis that shows that Hispanic and Native American women also have worse birth outcomes than white women.\nThe federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has explicitly called for including pregnancy when \u201cprioritiz(ing) the most vulnerable\u201d to climate change. The US government should increase funding for efforts addressing the impact of climate change on human health. Cities, states, and Native American tribes should also ensure that their programming to prepare for climate impacts on human health includes pregnancy health and addresses reproductive injustice because of racism and poverty.\nThe US Congress should pass federal heat protection for all workers, for example through passing the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, and the Senate should pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act so that pregnant workers have an explicit right to accommodations, including to prevent heat-related illnesses during pregnancy. States should ensure that workers have and know about workplace protections for pregnancy already in place, including accommodations.\n\u201cThe effects of climate change and extreme heat on pregnant people are a matter of racial, gender, and economic justice and cannot be ignored,\u201d said Sarah Brafman, senior policy counsel and director of the DC office at A Better Balance. \u201cOne key step our lawmakers need to take is to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to ensure that pregnant people \u2013 especially low-income women and women of color who are too often exposed to higher rates of extreme heat \u2013 are able to seek accommodations so they don't have to choose between their paycheck and their health by continuing to work in dangerously hot environments.\u201d\nClimate change impacts on health should be included in medical education. Doctors, midwives, and community birth workers can provide information about the importance of hydration and keeping cool during pregnancy. Doctors should ask pregnant patients about their work and exposure to heat and, where appropriate, provide letters to employers to help workers access reasonable workplace accommodations.\nCities and other US jurisdictions should revise their plans and websites before the next heating season to include pregnancy and to address the special needs in communities of color, Human Rights Watch and its partner groups said.\n\u201cBlack women experience higher rates of premature birth and negative birth outcomes, which affect their and their children's chances for a healthy life,\u201d said Kelly Davis, Chief Equity Officer at the National Birth Equity Collaborative. \u201cClimate change impacts, including heat, remains a challenge for Black people, along with other marginalized and minority groups, for achieving healthy pregnancies and supportive parenting environments. The movement to combat climate change must include addressing structural racism and gender oppression in service of birth equity.\u201d\nFor more information on the health impacts of increasing heat and reproductive justice, please see below. \n\u00a0\nNo Federal Action Plan on Climate Change, Health Impact \nThe National Climate Assessment, written by the US Global Change Research Program, a body mandated by the US Congress to summarize current and future impacts of climate change on the US, has, together with many scientists and advocates, warned over the past 20 years of extensive negative health impacts from climate change, including increases in heat-related illness and deaths.\nThe US has struggled with increasing numbers of extreme weather events over the past decade including heat waves, hurricanes, wildfires and massive flooding that have devastated communities and, between 2007 and 2017 alone, cost the US government $350 billion. Weather-related disasters have cost the US over $46 billion so far in 2020 alone.\nDespite this, the US government has no federal plan to address the climate crisis or its detrimental impact on human health. Under the administration of President Donald Trump the United States has reversed course on reducing carbon emissions. Trump canceled his predecessor\u2019s climate action plan and pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nBut President Barack Obama\u2019s plan was also not ambitious enough in reducing emissions and contained little on the health impact of climate change. Funding for the federal flagship climate change and health program \u201cBuilding Resilience Against Climate Effects\u201d (BRACE), allows for little more than providing advice and modest grants for a total of 18 tribes and states to address some climate impacts. The program received about $10 million for 2019.Pregnancy Information in Government Heat Plans\nMany cities, counties, and states in the US have begun to independently plan for and take action on climate change. Heat awareness efforts have understandably largely focused on reducing mortality and heat-related illnesses. This approach risks authorities missing the hidden costs of heat such as adverse birth outcomes, increases in violence during periods of hotter weather, mental health impacts, and reductions in productivity and educational achievements.\nBRACE and academic experts on the relationship of heat to health have urged authorities to assess how heat affects different populations and to recognize that some are much more vulnerable than others. One guiding document by BRACE provides a strong emphasis and substantial supporting research on the importance of including racial inequities in addressing heat illness and other impacts.\nAlthough information on the added vulnerability to heat illness during pregnancy and the link between heat and adverse birth outcomes have been available for years, only two cities included in the Human Rights Watch analysis included this in their planning or analysis. The Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications recommends that during pregnancy people should \u201cavoid extreme heat, stay well hydrated and follow advice of their medical providers.\u201d Philadelphia\u2019s page on heat safety includes pregnant women as a vulnerable population. Since the review was conducted, Human Rights Watch has seen that New York City has also included this group, noting on one webpage: \u201c[p]regnant people are sensitive to heat. An increase in body temperature may bring on labor, preterm birth or lower birth weight. Those who are pregnant should stay in a cool place, drink fluids and take it easy when it\u2019s hot.\u201d\nThe CDC and the EPA have acknowledged pregnant people as an at-risk population in their \u201cExtreme Heat Guidebook.\u201d The National Climate Assessment 4 (2018) included studies on heat and preterm birth and included pregnant people as an at-risk group. The US Global Change Research Program also noted that climate-related exposures \u201cmay lead to adverse pregnancy and newborn health outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds), preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy), [and] increased neonatal death.\u201d\nState-level climate change planning documents from North Carolina, New York, and Oregon have noted that pregnancy presents additional vulnerability as well as the link to preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes.\nAlthough the impact of heat on pregnancy health may be acknowledged elsewhere, front-facing heat public education webpages for the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency do not include pregnant people as an at-risk group. Communication efforts should include pregnancy vulnerabilities, including through a reproductive and racial justice lens.Heat and Pregnancy Health\nFor hormonal and other reasons, such as their increased size and smaller skin-to-volume ratio, during pregnancy people are less able to regulate their body temperature and are more vulnerable to heat stress. The additional vulnerability to heat has been noted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The CDC\u2019s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, a government research and education agency) says:\n\nIf your job causes your body temperature to become higher than 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), you may suffer from heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or dehydration, which are not good for either you or your developing baby. If you are pregnant, you are more likely to get heat exhaustion or heat stroke sooner than a nonpregnant worker. This is because your body must work harder to cool down both your body and your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, you are also more likely to become dehydrated. This also means you won\u2019t be able to cool yourself as well by sweating. ... Exposure to excess heat at work could increase your chances of having baby with a birth defect or other reproductive problems.\n\nA 2020 review paper of academic peer-reviewed studies in the US found that \u201cfive out of five studies on heat and preterm birth found an effect, and three out of three studies on heat and low birth weight found an effect.\u201d Increased risk of preterm birth because of high temperature exposures \u201crange(d) \u2026 from 8.6 percent to 21.0 percent.\u201d Two reports \u201cfound an association of racial/ethnic disparity and heat exposure with an increasing risk of preterm birth; higher risk was found among black mothers.\u201d Another study on pregnancy health and heat found that pregnant Black women had more hospitalizations due to heat exposure during their pregnancy than other women.\nOne 2017 review of 28 peer-reviewed papers on heat and adverse birth outcomes found: \u201cThere is evidence that temperature extremes adversely impact birth outcomes, including, but not limited to: changes in length of gestation, birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal stress in unusually hot temperature exposures.\u201d Findings from another review of 15 studies, also published in 2017, \u201cconfirm the crucial importance of the adverse health effects of climate change especially in the perinatal period.\u201d\nHeat has other impacts on pregnancy health. Another important effect is that warming temperatures increase the formation of ground-level ozone, which can cause respiratory illness in pregnant women and can lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Forest fires, like those in California in recent years, also worsen air quality and release large amounts of fine particulate matter, PM 2.5, a toxic pollutant in smoke that is linked to poor pregnancy outcomes.Heat and Inequity\nActivists and scholars examining racial and environmental justice in the US are increasingly recognizing the negative health effects of heat exposure, and have noted, in a CDC report for example, that \u201cmany pathways that modify vulnerability to extreme heat vary by race and ethnicity.\u201d\nA study published in 2020 found that areas formerly subjected to redlining \u2013 a racist housing policy banned in 1968 that made Black and other minority neighborhoods less valuable, leading to further marginalization \u2013 in 108 urban areas across the US are still mostly \u2013 94 percent \u2013 hotter than non-redlined areas, by as much as 7 degrees Celsius. An investigation by the National Public Radio service found a strong correlation between poverty, often in communities of color, and heat in cities.\nOne study of 234,042 adult deaths during warm periods between 2000 and 2011 in New York City found that \u201cdeaths during heat waves were more likely to occur in black individuals than other race/ethnicity.\u201d A study of Portland, Oregon, found \u201cgroups with limited adaptive capacity, including those in poverty and non-white populations, are at higher risk for heat exposure\u201d noting that \u201cclimate change is catalyst for injustice.\u201d\nAir conditioning protects against heat, but is unequally distributed. In one study, for example, prevalence of central air conditioning among Black households was less than half that among white households in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh, and deaths among Black people were more strongly associated with hot temperatures. Energy burdens \u2013 the proportion of family income spent on energy bills \u2013 are higher for minority groups in the US and when money is tight families may not be able to use air conditioning.\nAs temperatures increase, heat exposure is also increasingly an issue of concern to labor unions and others working to protect the rights and health of outdoor workers \u2013 for example construction workers, farmworkers and airport workers, and people working in hot indoor sites such as some warehouses. The nongovernmental organization Public Citizen estimated that in July 2017, over 1.1 million outdoor workers labored in dangerous heat each working day, including 265,000 agriculture workers. A study in Florida found that pregnant farmworkers found it difficult to access health services that included information about occupational health, including exposure to heat.\nWhile government health agencies advise workers to take \u201cplenty of breaks\u201d in cool or air-conditioned areas, this may not be possible for pregnant farmworkers, and especially women who need to earn money before their baby is born and have no paid parental leave.\nA national heat standard, which would protect outdoor workers by mandating water, rest, shade, and other protections, has long been needed. NIOSH issued criteria for a heat standard in 1972 and then updated it in 1986 and 2016.\nHowever, the Occupational Safety and Health Agency, which is responsible for work safety and rules and regulations, has never issued a heat standard. It has only the vague and hard-to-enforce general duty clause (of the Occupational Safety and Health Act) to punish employers for forcing people to work in health-threatening heat. Pregnancy accommodations, such as to be able to take more frequent water and cooling breaks, should be better protected, as envisaged in the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, Human Rights Watch and partners said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Fact Sheet: Increasing Temperatures because of the Climate Change Crisis is a Reproductive Justice Issue in the United States\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Correction\n  \n\nThis news release was updated on October 23 to include mention of relevant findings in a Buzzfeed article from August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States Economic Justice Racial Justice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nClimate Change Environment and Human Rights Environment and Health Poverty and Inequality Women's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nNew US Bill Would Help People Working in Dangerous Heat \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nPregnancy Risks Rise with Extreme Heat, But Public Health Info is Lacking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Dying Here\u201d\n\n\nThe Fight for Life in a Louisiana Fossil Fuel Sacrifice Zone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nIn Sheep\u2019s Clothing\n\n\nUnited States\u2019 Poorly Regulated Nonprofit Hospitals Undermine Health Care Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nNew US Bill Would Help People Working in Dangerous Heat \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 8, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nPregnancy Risks Rise with Extreme Heat, But Public Health Info is Lacking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
