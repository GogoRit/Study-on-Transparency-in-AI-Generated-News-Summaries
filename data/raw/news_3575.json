Wade in North Carolina, many pro-life and Christian groups are working to limit or end access to abortion across the state.\nNorth Carolina Right To Life, a nonprofit organization led by Dr. William Pincus, is one of these groups that seeks anti-abortion legislation.\n\u201cRight To Life\u2019s two big goals are to elect pro-life officials and to protect the innocent and voiceless because if you think about it, who is the most defenseless thing in the world?\" Pincus said. \"An unborn baby.\"\u00a0\nWhile NCRTL is not an explicitly religious organization, Pincus said his personal religious identity as a devout Christian inspires him to advocate against abortion.\nIn order to prepare for the upcoming election season, NCRTL has created a voter guide identifying pro-life candidates for political office in all voting districts in the state. The Political Action Committee associated with NCRTL contributes funds to these endorsed candidates.\u00a0\nPincus, said he believes the overturning of Roe is the starting point for building upon anti-abortion legislation in North Carolina.\u00a0\n\u201cIn 1973, you had this judicial overreach, where the Supreme Court wrongfully decided that the right to abortion was included in the Constitution, which it is not there at all,\u201d Pincus said. \u201cThe only thing that the overturning of Roe v. Wade did was say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s give it back to the state where it belongs\u2019.\u201d\nNCRTL PAC\u2019s political endorsements this election season include Ted Budd for U.S. Senate, and Courtney Geels for U.S. House in District 4.\nNumerous other groups join NCRTL in supporting pro-life candidates this election season, such as the North Carolina Values Coalition, NC Family Policy Council, and NC Faith and Freedom Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe North Carolina Values Coalition is an explicitly Christian, non-partisan organization that advocates for pro-life, pro-family and pro-religious liberty causes, according to their website.\u00a0\nTheir mission statement explains that they believe humans are created in the image of God as either male or female and that life is precious. It says they value life and are committed to protecting it at every stage: the unborn, the orphan and the elderly.\u00a0\n\u201cThe pro-life movement never asks a woman to give up her life,\u201d Laura Macklem, press and political director for N.C. Values Coalition, said. \u201cN.C. Values Coalition believes that in all circumstances possible, the effort should be made to save both the life of the mother and the baby.\u201d\nThe nonprofit works with organizations such as iVoterGuide and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America to rate candidates on their abortion-rights policies and canvass door to door. The N.C. Values Coalition\u2019s main criteria for endorsement of candidates is being pro-life, according to Macklem.\u00a0\nShe said the organization was thrilled with the overturn of Roe v. Wade because it gives state governments the opportunity to analyze public viewpoints and puts the decision back into the hands of elected officials.\u00a0\nWhile groups like N.C. Values Coalition and NCRTL are supporting anti-abortion legislation through political advocacy, other groups in North Carolina are advocating against abortion through prayer and vigils.\u00a0\nThe Chapel Hill campaign of 40 Days for Life, an international anti-abortion group, is organizing daily vigils outside Chapel Hill Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\n\u201c40 Days for Life is there to be a prayerful, peaceful presence,\u201d Chapel Hill campaign leader Kathleen Siemer said. \u201cWe\u2019re invoking God\u2019s forgiveness for all the loss of life that has occurred throughout our nation and in our community.\u201d\u00a0\nVigils such as these are often seen as antagonistic to people seeking care at reproductive health centers, Siemer said. However, she said she believes the prayers offered by 40 Days for Life are necessary for the wellbeing of mothers and children.\n\u201cOur politics are with the Lord,\" Siemer said. \"Our organization is not political. We don\u2019t talk about politics because [abortion] is a spiritual war.\"\nAlthough 40 Days for Life is an apolitical group, Siemer said she thinks the overturning of Roe v. Wade was a blessing and an answer to the prayers of pro-life Christians. She said the court decision moves the legality of abortion to the state and people now have the ability to vote on the issue.\u00a0\nSiemer added that It doesn\u2019t change 40 Days for Life\u2019s work or philosophy, and they still plan to continue praying for women and children in their community.\u00a0\n\n\n\n        To get the day's news and headlines in your inbox each morning, sign up for our email newsletters.\n    \n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\n\n\n\n@DTHCityState | city@dailytarheel.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWalker LivingstonWalker Livingston is the 2024 enterprise managing editor at The Daily Tar Heel.
