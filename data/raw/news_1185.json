Wade, as it appeared poised to do, according to the leaked draft opinion that had been publicized the night before. The Kentucky lawmaker dodged the question, insisting that the takeaway from the SCOTUS draft was not the obliteration of abortion protections it forecasted but \u201cthe fact that the draft was leaked\u201d\u2014a fixation for many Republican lawmakers over the week. \u201cYou need, it seems to me, a lecture to concentrate on what the news is today,\u201d McConnell told reporters, per Politico.X contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.By Thursday, however, McConnell was apparently willing to say the quiet part out loud. Asked by USA Today whether a national ban \u201cis something worthy of a debate,\u201d the top Senate Republican said Republicans might indeed entertain the idea, according to the interview, which was published on Saturday. \u201cIf the leaked opinion became the final opinion, legislative bodies\u2014not only at the state level but at the federal level\u2014certainly could legislate in that area,\u201d McConnell said. \"And if this were the final decision, that was the point that it should be resolved one way or another in the legislative process. So yeah, it\u2019s possible.\u201dAs NBC News pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that any legislation to outlaw abortion\u2014or enshrine it nationwide\u2014would gain 60 votes in the Senate in the near future\u201d\u2014circumstances that render Democrats\u2019 plan to force a vote to codify abortion rights into federal law this week all but doomed. Some Democrats, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, have proposed changing the filibuster in order to pass legislation that codifies Roe into law with a majority vote. \u00a0But \u201ceven if Democrats could somehow eliminate the filibuster and muster 51 votes to codify Roe,\u201d The New York Times notes, \u201cthe move could backfire; a Republican majority in Congress and a Republican president could then ban abortion nationwide with 51 votes\u2014with no need to change Senate rules that Republicans have maintained are sacrosanct.\u201dIn his USA Today interview, McConnell insisted that if Republicans retake the Senate in this year\u2019s midterm elections, he would not end the filibuster to pass legislation on abortion. \u201cNo carve out of the filibuster\u2014period,\u201d he said. \u201cFor any subject.\u201d But McConnell could change his mind on the filibuster at any point. He has already spent years helping remake the judiciary that now, according to Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s draft opinion, appears likely to strike down the 1973 landmark decision guaranteeing a woman\u2019s right to choose. And in 2017, under his leadership, Republicans scrapped the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees to advance the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump\u2019s first pick. (Democrats have also altered the filibuster for presidential appointments, the Washington Post notes.)Democrats have seized on the fear of a nationwide abortion ban to galvanize voters ahead of November\u2019s elections. \u201cMitch McConnell confirmed what voters have long known: Republicans will use every tool they can, from the courts to Congress, to make abortion illegal everywhere and strip away a woman\u2019s right to make our own decisions,\u201d Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) said in a statement Saturday, in response to USA Today\u2019s reporting. \u201cFor voters, the stakes of protecting and expanding our Democratic Senate majority in 2022 have never been higher.\u201dX contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Several Senate Republicans, including Sens. Mitt Romney and Cynthia Lummis, told NBC News last Thursday that abortion restrictions should be left up to states, though others, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Kevin Cramer, weren\u2019t willing to rule out a push for federal action. Neither was Sen. Joni Ernst, a member of the GOP leadership. \u201cWe\u2019re debating now. We\u2019re going to continue to debate that,\u201d she told the outlet.More Great Stories From Vanity FairSamuel Alito\u2019s Roe Message Is Clear: This Supreme Court Is Ready to Burn It All DownCobalt Mining: Where Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Michael Bloomberg Are Spending Their MoneyRon DeSantis Claims to Have Special Knowledge of Walt Disney\u2019s ThinkingConservatives Equate Supreme Court Roe v.
