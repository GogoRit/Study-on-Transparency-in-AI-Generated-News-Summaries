Russian state intelligence is hacking international research centers that are racing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, the U.K., U.S. and Canadian government's said today.

Like the Lone Star State\u2019s S.B. 8, the Idaho bill bans abortions after six weeks, a time by which many people don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant. Yet unlike Texas, which empowers any old private citizen to sue to enforce the law, Idaho specifically allows\u2014and some might say encourages\u2014family members of the fetus, including family members of rapists, to sue abortion providers for up to four years after the procedure. In other words, at a time when reproductive rights are under daily assault, Idaho is going the extra mile to make things extra evil and f--ked up for pregnant people, some of whom got that way as a result of a violent crime. And you know who else thinks this bill is beyond the pale? Idaho\u2019s governor. But don\u2019t worry, he put his reservations aside and signed it into law anyway.In a message to Lieutenant Governor Janice McGeachin, Idaho governor Brad Little wrote, \u201cWhile I support the pro-life policy in this legislation, I fear the novel civil enforcement mechanism will in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.\u201d He said that he had \u201csignificant concerns with the unintended consequences this legislation will have on victims of sexual assault,\u201d noting that \u201cthis legislation risks retraumatizing victims by affording monetary incentives to wrongdoers and family members of rapists.\u201d (The bill establishes minimum damages of $20,000, in addition to legal fees.) But rather than vetoing it\u2014even if it were a symbolic veto that ultimately got overturned\u2014Little signed the bill and encouraged the Republican-controlled legislature to fix any \u201cunintended consequences of the legislation,\u201d which we\u2019re sure they\u2019ll get to posthaste.As we\u2019ve seen in the case of Texas, even just the threat of lawsuits has had a chilling effect; since September, when S.B. 8 went into effect, abortions in Texas have plummeted 60%, according to The New York Times. On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood said its clinics in Idaho would stay open, adding in a statement: \u201cThis law is unconstitutional, dangerous, and an assault on the hundreds of thousands of Idahoans of reproductive age. There is no excuse or justification for the trauma and harm this law will cause.\u201dOf course, Idaho and Texas aren\u2019t the only states trying to turn The Handmaid\u2019s Tale into a work of nonfiction. In Missouri, one lawmaker wants to inhibit residents from obtaining abortions out of state, while another wants to make it a felony to abort an ectopic pregnancy, a medical condition that is the leading cause of death in the first trimester. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Oklahoma\u2019s House of Representatives passed a bill banning abortions at any time, except in cases where the procedure is needed \u201cto save the life of the mother.\u201d Which was big of them.If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click\u00a0here\u00a0to\u00a0subscribe.More Great Stories From Vanity Fair\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 Can Ukrainian Freedom Fighters Stand Up to the Russian Military?\u2014 Grimes on Music, Mars, and Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\u2014 Trump Is Blowing a Gasket Over His Joke of a Social Media Network\u2014 How the Atlanta Spa Shootings Tell a Story of America\u2014 Inside the Succession Drama at Scholastic\u2014 Trump Is Now Spitballing Ways to Launch More Russian War, Then \u201cSit Back and Watch\u201d\u2014 The Psychology Behind Putin\u2019s War\u2014 From the Archive: How a Once Faceless Putin Took Control of the World\u2019s Largest Country\u2014 Not a subscriber?
