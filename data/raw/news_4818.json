But before you put me in an ideological box and assume you know who I will vote for this fall, let me complicate the issue.My conscience and faith lead me to oppose abortion. Indeed, Catholics are taught not to take the life of an unborn child. However, Catholic or not, this is a moral question which women facing an unwanted pregnancy have to wrestle with. There are indeed, situations in which even a rigorist conscience might pause when faced with rape, incest, or risking the death of the mother.Add to this that we live in a pluralistic society. One group\u2019s religious and moral convictions should not be imposed on another without broad societal consensus. Our country does not have consensus about abortion. Therefore, the emphasis should be on persuasion and compassion rather than seeking a political solution to abortion (like overturning Roe v Wade).It is not honest to talk about being pro-life without also talking about what Cardinal Joseph Bernardin called \"the Seamless Garment,\"\u00a0or the Consistent Ethic of Life. Of course, this includes opposition not only to abortion, but also taking a life through euthanasia, capital punishment\u00a0and unjust war. Equally unacceptable are failures to protect life by tolerating poverty, racism, lack of affordable health care\u00a0and similar societal injustices that threaten the lives and dignity of human beings.That\u2019s a tall order, but to be pro-life one must stand in solidarity with all humanity and work to protect all life. Unfortunately, too often the loudest voices against abortion are weak on protecting the lives of vulnerable human beings after they are born.Would it not be better to:Prevent unplanned pregnancies through education and reliable family planning?Persuade those who want to overturn Roe v Wade that there are better ways to support women and protect human life.Support women facing a crisis pregnancy by providing financial and emotional support not only to give birth but also to raise their child to adulthood and providing adoption services (This is already broadly done).Care for women who chose abortion but who now are seeking peace and reconciliation through programs like Project Rachel.The evidence is that such holistic caring for pregnant women and children reduces the abortion rate more than restrictive laws.So, is it possible to be pro-Life AND pro-choice? First, this is a false binary choice. Being pro-choice does not equal favoring abortion. It remains a tragic choice.The answer, however, I believe, is simple and complex: Who is my neighbor? If my neighbor is everyone, then how do I love, respect\u00a0and protect their lives and dignity? To be pure about protecting human life means that I have to respect all human lives \u2013 born and unborn.In order to be a fully pro-life voter I propose asking:Who among our candidates has the more comprehensive understanding of protecting life \u2013 both unborn and born? Society must reckon with the causes.What will you do to decrease the demand for abortion?As regretful as abortion is, I believe the decision rests within the conscience of the pregnant woman. This should not primarily be a legal issue, but a moral one. It must be won by persuasion and support, not law.Susan Vogt lives in Covington and was employed for over 25 years as a Family Life Minister in two Catholic dioceses, including responsibility for overseeing the pro-life work of the Diocese of Covington.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Cincinnati Enquirer Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Sports Betting Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.cincinnati.com.
