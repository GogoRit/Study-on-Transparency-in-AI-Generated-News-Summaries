(Video: AP)Listen5 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveIowa\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature on Tuesday passed a bill banning most abortions after about six weeks.The legislation was passed during a rare one-day special session called by Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) for the \u201csole purpose\u201d of enacting new restrictions on abortion. Reynolds celebrated the bill\u2019s passage in a statement late Tuesday and said she will sign it on Friday. \u201cJustice for the unborn should not be delayed,\u201d she said.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIowa\u2019s House and Senate passed the legislation along mostly partisan lines late Tuesday after hours of hearings and sometimes heated protests. It is expected to face legal challenges.Abortion is currently legal in Iowa up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.In a statement, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart accused state Republicans of \u201cignoring the will of their voters\u201d and praised Democratic lawmakers for opposing abortion restrictions \u201cthat the majority of Iowans do not support.\u201dAdvertisementHundreds of demonstrators packed the Iowa Capitol in Des Moines, some shouting \u201cBans off our bodies\u201d while others yelled \u201cAbortion is murder.\u201d According to the Des Moines Register, at one point supporters and opponents of the bill had to be separated by a state trooper.After the legislation cleared House and Senate committees Tuesday afternoon, lawmakers began floor debates that sometimes became contentious. \u201cIf they are not ready to have a baby, they shouldn\u2019t have sex. A lot of people need to review their birds and bees,\u201d Republican Rep. Brad Sherman said at point, while Democrats called the bill \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cobscene.\u201dSkip to end of carouselWhere is abortion legal and illegal? (The Washington Post)We\u2019re tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat.End of carouselOnce it is signed into law, the bill, which passed 56-34 in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, will add Iowa to the wave of conservative-leaning states \u2014 including North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 that have put in place abortion restrictions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion last summer. The Iowa restrictions further limit access to the procedure in the Midwest.Advertisement\u201cI believe the pro-life movement is the most important human rights cause of our time,\u201d Reynolds said last week as she ordered the special session and promised to sign the bill.After the Supreme Court ruling last year, Reynolds asked a district court to allow a roughly six-week abortion ban that had passed in 2018 but was challenged in court to take effect. After the court declined to do so, she took the request to the Iowa Supreme Court, which deadlocked on the matter earlier this year. After the deadline, Reynolds called for the special session.During Tuesday\u2019s House debate, some Democrats quoted one of the justices, Thomas Waterman, who called the state\u2019s attempt to revive the 2018 six-week abortion ban \u201can unprecedented effort to judicially revive a statute that was declared unconstitutional.\u201dStates where abortion is legal, banned or under threatThe legislation passed Tuesday bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity has been detected, often around six weeks into a pregnancy. The bill says a provider must perform an abdominal ultrasound on a patient, and if \u201ca fetal heartbeat\u201d is detected, an abortion is prohibited.AdvertisementThe measure includes a few exceptions, such as for rape and incest, provided that the cases are reported to law enforcement. It also includes exceptions for fetal abnormalities that are \u201cincompatible with life\u201d and for medical emergencies in which a pregnant person faces death or serious harm to their health.Democrats said the legislation would put someone experiencing a miscarriage at risk by forcing doctors to take extra time determining whether they qualify for an abortion. It also sets unrealistic time constraints for someone to report rape or incest to qualify for an abortion exception under the bill, they said.Share this articleShareBefore the bill was passed, Democratic state Sen. Janice Weiner said it should not go into effect immediately. The rushed process shows \u201cincredible disrespect\u201d to Iowa doctors who would need time to understand the new rules, she said.AdvertisementCommittee hearings sometimes became tense with the sounds of protesters outside the room pouring in.Francesca Turner, a Des Moines gynecologist, said the bill doesn\u2019t make clear when doctors can step in during pregnancy complications. \u201cAt what point when your wife or your daughter or your sister is having a medical emergency during a pregnancy do I get to save her life?\u201d Turner asked.Katie Buck, a West Des Moines resident, testified alongside her son, who was born with trisomy 18, a genetic complication caused by an extra chromosome. Under the legislation, she said, her son\u2019s condition would qualify as a fetal abnormality that would allow an abortion.\u201cAlex is 7 years old. How can he be incompatible with life?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have no idea how hard we had to fight against this \u2018fatal fetal anomaly\u2019 label to get him the medical care he needed to survive.\u201dWhat you need to know about Iowa\u2019s impending abortion banPlanned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa pledged to challenge the law in court in a statement released early Wednesday, calling the bill a \u201cdevastating blow to reproductive freedom.\u201dAdvertisementPlanned Parenthood North Central States said on Facebook that it would continue to provide abortion care \u201cto the extent legally allowed\u201d and help patients connect with providers and resources elsewhere.\u201cEvery day this law is in effect, Iowans will face life-threatening barriers to get desperately needed medical care \u2014 just as we have seen in other states with similar bans,\u201d said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director for the ACLU of Iowa.Share CommentsSign upTOP STORIESD.C. regionLocal news, weather, sports, events, restaurants and moreJackson Rutledge wants to know the \u2018why.\u2019 The Nats\u2019 data push helps.The schedule and the injury report do Wizards no favors vs. CelticsNats\u2019 Josiah Gray, already an all-star, earns a new title: Opening Day starterbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
