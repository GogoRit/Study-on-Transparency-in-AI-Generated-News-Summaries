Tony Evers speaks to reporters following the primary election Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022, in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\nGOP lawmakers quickly adjourned Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 latest call for a special session Tuesday that Evers said would have created a \u201cpathway\u201d to overturning Wisconsin\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion ban.Shortly after 10 a.m. Tuesday, Republican Senate President Chris Kapenga gaveled in and gaveled out of the session to a mostly empty Senate chamber. A little more than an hour later, Republicans convened and adjourned the session in the Assembly over the vocal objections of several Democratic state representatives.It\u2019s a scene that\u2019s become familiar in Wisconsin government, where Evers has proposed several special sessions on everything from expanding Medicaid to tightening gun laws. As governor, Evers can call special sessions to shine a spotlight on issues, but he can\u2019t compel Republicans to vote on his plans.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was expected to be the case with Evers\u2019 latest call for a special session, which Republicans described as a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d aimed at distracting voters from issues such as crime and inflation.Still, Evers told reporters after the session adjourned that Republicans owed the public a discussion on once again legalizing abortion in Wisconsin, a position that polling has shown is popular in the state.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue,\u201d Evers said. \u201cAnd we expect that state representatives will actually care enough about the will of the people and care enough about women\u2019s rights in the state of Wisconsin that they\u2019d show up and do business.\u201dEvers\u2019 latest special session was different than the one he called in June where he asked lawmakers to vote on a bill to repeal Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban.His latest proposal would have let Wisconsin residents propose citizen ballot initiatives, a process in place in about a dozen states around the country. The initiatives let residents in those states bypass their state legislatures by placing proposed laws or constitutional amendments directly on the ballot.Because Evers\u2019 plan would have amended the Wisconsin Constitution, it would first have to pass two consecutive sessions of the Legislature. That means lawmakers would need to pass the proposal this year, and then the next state Legislature \u2014 elected in November \u2014 would need to pass the identical plan in 2023.The proposal would then go before voters in a statewide election to decide whether they want to allow for ballot initiatives in Wisconsin. The soonest that could happen would be 2023.If the governor\u2019s plan passed each of those steps, it would open the door to future statewide ballot initiatives that don\u2019t require the Legislature\u2019s blessing. Those would not be limited to ballot questions involving abortion.Procedurally, it would be complicated. But politically speaking, Evers\u2019 plan was part of a straightforward push by Democrats to frame the 2022 midterm elections around abortion rights. The concerted push comes after weeks of Republicans attacking Democrats for being weak on crime, a message polling suggests may be swaying some voters.Evers\u2019 campaign released a new ad Tuesday attacking Republican opponent Tim Michels for his long opposition to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. Michels released his own ad featuring three county sheriffs attacking Evers for the Wisconsin Parole Commission\u2019s decision to grant parole to hundreds of inmates who were eligible for release.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the Wisconsin Legislature did (and didn\u2019t do) in its final months of session \n\n \n\n\n\nEvers seeks deal as alternative to Republican PFAS bill \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin Republicans seek to curtail governor\u2019s veto power \n\n \n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin bill would ban foreign spending on state, local referendums \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
