If fulfilled, these commitments will support the nation in harnessing the demographic dividend and reaching the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\nDuring his speech, Minister Al-Tamimi said: \u201cThe National Family Planning Strategy will provide families, women and young people opportunities to build their future with confidence. It will help Iraqis organise their families better, plan financially for a better future and will reduce the burden of the health system. We thank all our partners, the different directorates, the UN Agencies, especially UNFPA for supporting the Ministry\u2019s team in the development of this strategy that will hopefully improve the livelihoods of individuals.\u201d\nCommenting on the importance of the strategy, UNFPA Representative to Iraq, Dr Rita Columbia, said: \u201cIn Iraq, the Adolescent Fertility rate is still among the highest in the region (70/1,000 adolescent girls); but the use of modern contraceptives is about 36%. It means that many couples and individuals who need family planning services do not have access to them, which violates their reproductive rights.\u201d\n\u201cUNFPA will continue to support the Ministry of Health at the Federal and Kurdistan Region levels with the strategy implementation. Our focus will be to ensure the strategy has a costed multisectoral people-based implementation plan, to strengthen the capacity of the public healthcare system to provide voluntary, high-quality family planning services, to improve the supply chain management and ensure the last mile delivery and to put the sexual and reproductive health needs of young people and people with disabilities in the centre of health and population policies,\u201d she added.\nThrough the entire process of strategy development, UNFPA worked closely with and provided technical support to the team of the Ministry of Health. UNFPA will continue to support the Government of Iraq during the implementation phase to ensure that all families and women can benefit from family planning services that are available, accessible, acceptable and high quality.\nThe strategy in English and a summary in Arabic can be found on the following link. The full Arabic version will follow.\nLink to the event.\nUNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, delivers a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person\u2019s potential is fulfilled.\nFor more information or media inquiries, please contact Ms Salwa Moussa, Communications Specialist, smoussa@unfpa.org\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nIraq\n\nSources\n\nGovernment of IraqUnited Nations Population Fund\n\nFormat\n\nOther\n\nThemes\n\nHealthProtection and Human Rights\n\nLanguages\n\nArabicEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nIraq\n\nIraq 2024-2025 IFRC network country plan\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Appeal          \nSource\n\nIFRC\n\nPosted\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq\n\nA Woman Responsible for Psychosocial Support Programmes\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            News and Press Release          \nSource\n\nCaritas\n\nPosted\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq\n+ 1 more\n\nUNHCR's support to the Kurdistan regional government\u2019s public services 2023-2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            News and Press Release          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n3 Mar 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n3 Mar 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIraq\n+ 1 more\n\nUNICEF Iraq Humanitarian Situation Report No. 1, 01 January-31 December 2023\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Situation Report          \nSource\n\nUNICEF\n\nPosted\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
