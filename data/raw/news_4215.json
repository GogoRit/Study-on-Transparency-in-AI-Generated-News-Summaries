Wade. The case, June v. Russo, centers on a Louisiana law that forces abortion providers to obtain \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d at hospitals within 30 miles. This measure is ostensibly meant to protect patient safety; in effect, though, it could leave the state \u2014 in which 10,000 women a year seek abortion care \u2014 with just one doctor at one clinic.\nLegislation like this is intentionally crafted to erode access to vital reproductive health care. The Supreme Court struck down a law with a nearly identical provision in Texas four years ago because it constituted such a substantial obstacle to abortion access. But rather than presenting such restrictions as what they are \u2014 unconstitutional, anti-choice legislation advanced by abortion opponents as part of a concerted attack on the right to choose\u00a0\u2014 conservatives insist they\u2019re precautionary measures, meant to safeguard women. \u201cWhile I began with the perspective of wanting to defend the rights of the unborn child, I\u2019ve been able to see that the abortion facilities, in their pursuit to sell abortions, kind of lose sight of the care for the woman in that process,\u201d the executive director of the anti-abortion group Louisiana Right to Life, who introduced admitting privileges to the Louisiana legislature in 2014, told Time. So far, similar laws have been proposed or passed in six states.\nIt\u2019s absurd on its face, the idea that licensed medical providers need to enter into official agreements with hospitals, when a patient experiencing a complication could simply go to an emergency room \u2014 or be taken to one, if the situation called for it. But, even worse, such laws also imply that abortion is inherently more dangerous than other procedures. This is patently untrue: Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the world. In 2015, researchers at University of California San Francisco looked at 54,911 abortions performed between 2009 and 2010, analyzing for complications. According to their findings, published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, only 2.1 percent of patients suffered a complication, and of those cases only 0.23 percent were serious. As noted by Time, you have a higher chance of suffering a serious complication during a colonoscopy, wisdom-teeth removal, or a tonsillectomy.\nAnd the risk of dying from an abortion performed in a licensed medical facility is far lower: Per a study from the National Institute of Health, legal abortion has a .0006 percent mortality rate, or 0.6 deaths per 100,000 procedures. To compare, in the United States, the current maternal mortality rate is 29 times higher than that.\nAbortion-related complications that require emergency hospital transfers are so rare in Louisiana, a United States District Court found they occur \u201cfar less than [once] a year, or less than one per several thousand patients.\u201d One of Louisiana\u2019s clinics reported that in a 23-year span, only four out of nearly 70,000 cases required hospital transfer, and that all women were able to receive care, with or without admitting privileges. In a five-year period, two of Louisiana\u2019s now-shuttered abortion clinics, one of which was forced to close in 2016 over the state\u2019s admitting-privileges law, transferred just three of their combined 14,000-plus patients. \n\u201cAs a doctor I can tell you that admitting privileges do not make abortion safer \u2014 they challenge access,\u201d Dr. Pooja Mehta, an OB/GYN in Louisiana and Fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said in a statement. \u201cAbortion in Louisiana is so safe that providers rarely have to send someone to an emergency room, much less admit them to a hospital.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s far more dangerous than abortion is losing access to the procedure, which would pose a legitimate, serious threat to women\u2019s health and safety. When people are forced to give birth against their will, they are more likely to get stuck in relationships with abusive partners, fall into poverty because they cannot afford to pay the exorbitant costs required to birth and raise a child, and even die from an illegal abortion. If the Supreme Court upholds Louisiana\u2019s law, this could soon become a reality for pregnant women in the state. There\u2019s a real risk of this happening: Even thought SCOTUS justices ruled just four years ago that Texas\u2019s admitting-privileges law was unconstitutional, the lawyers fighting back against Louisiana\u2019s anti-abortion law today are now facing a new, conservative-majority court.\n\u201cUnnecessary requirements like admitting privileges will make health care even more difficult to access by taking skilled providers out of our communities,\u201d said Mehta. \u201cIn Louisiana this will potentially leave us with just one remaining clinic in the state. This is dangerous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStay in touch.\nGet the Cut newsletter delivered daily\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n          Privacy Policy and\n          Terms of Service apply.\n        \nVox Media, LLC Terms and Privacy Notice\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nabortion rights\n\n\nscotus\n\n\nsupreme court\n\n\nreproductive rights\n\n\npower\n\n\npolitics\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nAbortion Is Safer Than Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Cut Shop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40 Best Sneakers for Women in Every Single Style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m on the Hunt for the Best Sunscreens Without a White Cast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 Best Luxury Candles That Double As Great Gifts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Rose Hanbury and Why Can\u2019t Kate Middleton Escape Her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Kate Middleton Really Go Grocery Shopping This Weekend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle Thinks Her New Brand\u2019s Name Is Perfect, Thank You\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Cheat Sheet for the World Figure Skating Championships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadame Clairevoyant: Horoscopes for the Week of March 17\u201323\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Is Rose Hanbury and Why Can\u2019t Kate Middleton Escape Her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Kate Middleton Really Go Grocery Shopping This Weekend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018All That Money Can Only Give You a Chance, Not a Guarantee\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Cheat Sheet for the World Figure Skating Championships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle Thinks Her New Brand\u2019s Name Is Perfect, Thank You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe city politic\n\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njd vance\n\nJ.D.
