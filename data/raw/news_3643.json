But as a teenager he drifted away from the faith. In 1975, two years after abortion was made legal nationwide by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, Laverty was training to be an anesthetist when he assisted a dilation-and-curettage procedure \u2014 an abortion \u2014 on a pregnant woman.\nThough he justified it at the time, he also buried it in his mind \u2014 until 2003, when a seemingly innocent question about his past triggered a horrifying thought. By that time, he had come back to the Church and had become a pro-life activist, and he believes the recovered memory was an inspiration from the Holy Spirit to try to atone for it.\nLaverty is planning to attend the pro-life \u201cMen\u2019s March\u201d on Saturday in Boston, one of the most pro-abortion cities in America.\nThe Men\u2019s March is based on the idea that men have a role to play in the pro-life movement that, to date, has often been muted, and an acknowledgment that many women who contemplate abortion have been driven to it by the actions or inactions of men.\n\u201cThese women aren\u2019t having a baby on their own. Someone is pushing it,\u201d Laverty said in an interview with the Register. \u201cMen haven\u2019t stepped up to the plate. It\u2019s time for men to step up to the plate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRadio Show Spawns Men\u2019s March\nThe Men\u2019s March, which has already taken place in Baltimore (November 2021), Tallahassee (June 2022) and Washington, D.C. (June 2021), grew out of a radio show hosted by Jim Havens called The Simple Truth, which is broadcast at 4pm by The Station of the Cross Catholic Media Network. (The network is an EWTN affiliate that produces many of its own shows; EWTN owns the Register.)\u00a0\nHavens, 44, has a weekly segment on his podcast called \u201cTestimony Tuesday,\u201d during which a man describes his experiences with abortion. (Laverty was a guest on July 6, 2021.)\nThe message of the march is that everyone has a right to life, including at the fetal stage of human development.\n\u201cWe simply want to proclaim that very basic truth \u2026 and stand up for our brothers and sisters in the womb,\u201d Havens told the Register.\n\n\n\n\n\nA public component of the movement is essential, he said.\n\u201cWe just need to proclaim the moral truth and let the chips fall where they may. But someone has to be in the public square,\u201d Havens said.\nThe co-founder of the march, Father Stephen Imbarrato, 70, is a retired priest of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe, New Mexico, now living in Florida. He co-hosts The Simple Truth radio show on Fridays.\nHe describes himself as a \u201cgreat-grandpop priest,\u201d stemming from his adoption of a son in 1987 (now deceased) who has grandchildren. He also describes himself as \u201cpost-abortive,\u201d meaning he fathered unborn children who died as the result of abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDecades before I was a priest, my pro-life journey started with not standing up for my babies and not standing up for whom I call my Eve,\u201d said Father Imbarrato, who was ordained at age 53, during a telephone interview with the Register.\n\u00a0\nCan \u2018Personhood\u2019 End Abortion?\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and sent abortion law back to the states, most pro-life activists have focused on trying to persuade state legislators to prohibit abortion, restrict abortion, or refrain from encouraging abortion, depending on the leanings of the state.\nMen\u2019s March organizers say they\u2019re thinking too small.\nThe event is formally called \u201cThe National Men\u2019s March to Abolish Abortion and Rally for Personhood,\u201d which reflects the founders\u2019 belief that abortion can and should be declared illegal nationwide by the U.S. Supreme Court if the court recognizes the right to life of all \u201cpersons,\u201d including unborn babies.\nThe argument stems from the country\u2019s founding documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says: \u201cNo person shall be \u2026 deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d The 14th Amendment says no state can \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The Declaration of Independence, which is not legally binding but remains influential, says \u201cLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness\u201d are \u201cunalienable Rights.\u201d\nOn that basis, organizers of the Men\u2019s March say, a majority of the justices on the federal Supreme Court could rule abortion illegal everywhere in the country by finding that an unborn child in the fetal stage of development is a person with a right to life, if the right case got before the court.\n\u201cAbortion is not going to end until we recognize constitutional personhood from the moment of conception. That\u2019s what\u2019s been lacking in the pro-life movement,\u201d Father Imbarrato told the Register.\nFather Imbarrato and fellow organizer Havens have also called on U.S. bishops to deny Communion to Catholic politicians who support legal abortion, including during the November 2021 Men\u2019s March in Baltimore, which coincided with the annual fall meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizers are planning another Men\u2019s March in Baltimore on Nov.14, which is the first day of the fall general assembly of the U.S. bishops.\n\u00a0\nHostile Environment\nThe event in Boston on Saturday begins with a gathering at 11:30am at the Planned Parenthood abortion facility at 1055 Commonwealth Ave., about two-tenths of a mile from the western edge of the campus of Boston University, the city\u2019s largest school of higher learning. After listening to speakers, participants at about 12:30pm are scheduled to walk more than 3 miles to the Massachusetts State House, where a rally is planned.\nParticipants are asked to wear suits \u2014 and clerics for clergy \u2014 to the event. Ties are optional.\nThe march route includes Boston Common, which in recent years has seen large left-wing demonstrations, including some that have attracted violence. Polls show Massachusetts is one of the most pro-abortion states in the country \u2014 a Pew Research Center poll in 2014 found that 74% of adults in Massachusetts think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, including 62% of Catholics.\u00a0\nMore recently, the state Legislature has expanded access to abortion twice since December 2020. A UMass Amherst poll in August 2022 found that 77% of Democrats and unenrolled voters (who make up more than 90% of registered voters in the state) support the state\u2019s abortion-expansion measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizers say they have permits for the march and that police will accompany participants throughout. But those planning to go expect opposition on Saturday.\n\u201cGoing to Boston, which is really the belly of the beast, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have some protests and aggravation,\u201d Laverty said.\nYet organizers say even vocal opposition is a chance for evangelization.\n\u201cYou come into contact with people who maybe otherwise would never come into contact with people of faith, and they\u2019ll see how we handle ourselves with love,\u201d Havens said.\n\u00a0\nUnsupportive Archdiocese\nOrganizers of the Men\u2019s March say they haven\u2019t received a warm reception from the dioceses where they have put on marches so far, adding that the reaction by the Archdiocese of Boston has been the chilliest.\nThey say they contacted the archdiocese in August as a courtesy, didn\u2019t hear back immediately, but later heard that the archdiocese was asking pastors not to make announcements about the march.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn archdiocesan official sent local pastors a written statement noting that Cardinal Se\u00e1n O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, attends the March for Life in Washington every January, acknowledging the change in circumstances since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision in June 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, and emphasizing that Cardinal O\u2019Malley\u2019s focus will continue to be the March for Life.\n\u201cThe Cardinal has always believed that changing minds and hearts on the question of abortion is the deeper challenge beyond changing laws, valuable as that event has been,\u201d states the letter, dated Aug.16, 2022.\nIt continues, \u201cSince the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, the abortion debate in the country has continued under new terms and conditions. There are events, marches and protests of all kinds being planned and scheduled.\u201d\n\u201cThe Archdiocese of Boston will focus all its attention and support on the March for Life in January 2023,\u201d the statement says. \u201cIt is important this commitment be understood. Parishes and schools may be approached to publicize or support other marches, but these will not be endorsed by the Archdiocese, nor should they be supported by its institutions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nC.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts and a frequent critic of Cardinal O\u2019Malley, said the response to the Men\u2019s March reflects a lukewarm approach to the pro-life cause. Abortion opponents, Doyle said in a written statement, should \u201clearn to work around the Archdiocese of Boston.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not an ally, but an obstacle to the pro-life movement in Massachusetts,\u201d Doyle said.\nOrganizers of the event say they are disappointed with the archdiocese\u2019s response.\n\u201cThe Archdiocese of Boston has actually been actively putting roadblocks up for us,\u201d Havens said.\n\u201cThe Archdiocese of Boston is not just dormant, but has become an obstacle to men speaking up for preborn babies, in terms of this march,\u201d Father Imbarrato said.\nThe Register asked a spokesman for the archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, for comment on the criticism. He provided a written statement the archdiocese sent to the organizers. It says in part:\n\u201cWe recognize that there are events, marches, and protests of all kinds being planned and scheduled following the SCOTUS ruling. However, we are committed to the annual March and have advised our parishes, schools, and ministries as such. \u2026 I should point out that events which are scheduled and publicized in the Archdiocese without consultation with our teams make it difficult to participate, especially when we have existing programs already in place.\u201d\nThe statement concludes, \u201cWe share a universal commitment to end abortion and to promote life and through our Pro-Life office and Archdiocesan ministries will continue the work.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated after posting.\n\n\nKeywords: \nprolife movement\nmen's march\nmatt mcdonald\narchdiocese of boston\nstate laws\nmassachusetts abortion\n\n\n\n\nMatthew McDonald Matthew McDonald is a staff reporter for The National Catholic Register and the editor of New Boston Post.
