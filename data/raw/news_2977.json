Buell/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControversial podcast host Joe Rogan came out swinging in a heated conversation about abortion rights with guest Seth Dillon, CEO of right-wing satire site Babylon Bee.\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d exclusively distributed on Spotify, Rogan hosted Dillon in a wide-ranging discussion about American political culture. (The episode is available at this link.)\nAmong other topics, the duo discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ended the constitutional right to an abortion in the U.S. after nearly 50 years. Rogan argued, \u201cThere\u2019s also women who have been raped, who should not have to fucking carry some rapist\u2019s baby. There\u2019s women who have been sexually assaulted before the age of 14.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDillon (via Mediaite) responded that \u201cthere are people who have been born of rape and are alive right now and are pro-life and they go around speaking, talking about how \u2018I had a right to live\u2019 and they will go out there and make an argument, a pro-life case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRogan pushed back: \u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to tell a 14-year-old girl, she has to carry a rapist\u2019s baby.\u201d He follow up by saying, \u201cLike, you don\u2019t have the right to tell my 14-year-old daughter, she has to carry her rapist\u2019s baby. You understand that?\u201d\nThe two went back and forth on this point. Dillon concluded the debate by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think two wrongs make a right\u2026 I don\u2019t think murder fixes a rape.\u201d\nThe Babylon Bee describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s best satire site, totally inerrant in all its truth claims. We write satire about Christian stuff, political stuff, and everyday life.\u201d\nRogan has previously expressed general support for abortion rights \u2014 but has called it a \u201ccomplicated issue.\u201d\n\u201cIt gets weird when the baby gets like six months old,\u201d Rogan said in a May 4 episode of his podcast. \u201cI know that some states [allow] late-term abortions and sometimes you need one for medical reasons, right? The woman could die if she gives birth. Like, it\u2019s a decision that people have to make.\u201d He added, \u201cI am 100% for a woman\u2019s right to choose. But as a human being, just a person observing things, there\u2019s a big difference between a little clump of cells and a fetus with an eyeball and a beating heart.\nThe exchange came after Rogan last month pushed back against claims that he\u2019s a \u201csecret conservative.\u201d On the July 23 episode of his podcast, he said GOP opposition to gay marriage is one reason he\u2019s not a conservative \u2014 and that he is \u201ca bleeding heart liberal\u201d on several issues, including abortion. Rogan also recently said is not a supporter of Donald Trump and has turned down Trump\u2019s requests to appear on \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRogan\u2019s podcast, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d consistently ranks No. 1 on Spotify\u2019s U.S. podcast charts. The popular podcaster\u2019s deal with Spotify is worth over $200 million.\nRogan came under fire this year for spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine, prompting a boycott by Neil Young and a few other artists. Rogan also\u00a0enraged L.A.\u2019s unhoused advocates after he told guest Tom Segura that \u201cMaybe you should just go shoot the homeless people.\u201d\nHe also faced a backlash from Spotify users and artists over his use of the N-word in past episodes of his podcast. In February, Spotify pulled 70 episodes \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d from the platform, dating from 2009 to 2018, which the company said it removed those at the request of Rogan and his team after talking about his \u201cracially insensitive\u201d language in some episodes.\n\n\n\nRead More About:\n\n\n\n\tJoe Rogan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript is required to load the comments.\nLoading comments...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMost Popular\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOver 450 Jewish Creatives and Professionals Denounce Jonathan Glazer's \u2018Zone of Interest\u2019 Oscars Speech in Open Letter (EXCLUSIVE)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch \u2018Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV\u2019 Online\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018Star Wars\u2019 Series \u2018The Acolyte\u2019 Sets Disney+ Premiere Date\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Seeks New Trial and Release From Jail\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018Wish\u2019 Gets Disney+ Streaming Release Date\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGeorge Lucas Backs Disney Board and CEO Bob Iger Amid Proxy Fight: \u2018Creating Magic Is Not for Amateurs\u2019\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOprah\u2019s \u2018Weight Loss Revolution\u2019 Is a Brief, Surface-Level Overview of Obesity Drugs: TV Review\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Review: Only Anne Hathaway Could Look This Confident Dating One of Her Daughter\u2019s Pop Idols\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDan Schneider Denies 'Sexualizing' Child Stars on Nickelodeon: 'Some Adults Project Their Adult Minds Onto Kids' Shows'\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Quiet on Set' Directors Explain How They Uncovered Stars' Secret Support for Pedophile Brian Peck and Whether Kids Are Safe on Set Post-Dan\u2026\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMust Read\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFilm\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Williams Faces His Legacy: 54 Oscar Noms, \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Mistakes and Changing the Movies Forever\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\tBy Andrew Wallenstein\n\n\t2 weeks\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAwards\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow Steven Spielberg Dominated Culture and the 1994 Oscars With 'Jurassic Park' and 'Schindler's List'\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAwards\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWolfgang Puck\u2019s Governors Ball Menu Includes 5,000 Chocolate Oscars Dusted With 24-Karat Gold\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTV\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney Enlisting Company-Wide Synergy to Spread Awareness of Earlier Oscar Start Time (EXCLUSIVE)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAwards\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow a More International Oscars Could Change Future Awards Seasons\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSign Up for Variety Newsletters\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nYour Email\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSign Up\t\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. // This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tVariety Confidential\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMore From Our Brands\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRolling Stone\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrisha Paytas Spent Years Trolling.
