But then in Castillo\u2019s senior year of college, her pro-life philosophy was put to a real-life test when she had an unplanned pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cThat was a moment I had to say to myself, \u2018now you have to walk your talk,\u2019\u201d Castillo said. \u201cIt truly rocked my world and made me redefine my relationship with God.\u201d\u00a0\nGod continued to test Lauren. She found herself struggling to fit in the desks in her classrooms and few professors took notice. She was already plugged into awareness groups on campus, but she found herself questioning why the university lacked standardized ways to assist a pregnant student. She was told the university handled it on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0\nLauren\u2019s due date was also her graduation date for her double major, honors program, but God had another plan and her son was born five-and-a-half-weeks premature. This challenge came with a whole new set of barriers.\u00a0\n\u201cI walked into my first pediatrician appointment and they said, \u2018you don\u2019t have insurance because your policy doesn\u2019t cover a child, so we can\u2019t see you,\u2019\u201d Castillo said.\u00a0\nShe\u00a0acknowledges these obstacles are even more intense\u00a0for\u00a0women\u00a0who only speak Spanish.\u00a0The pressures felt from doctors,\u00a0family members\u00a0or even the community can be overwhelming.\u00a0- Advertisement -\n\n\n\nCastillo, who had done homework while in labor,\u00a0delivered on a Thursday and was back in class the following week. She\u00a0was trying to figure out where and when she could nurse and change diapers. She leaned on her mom a lot at this point for help with her son, but her mom was also recovering from Leukemia treatment at the time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe student mom made it through that challenging time in her life with the grace of God. She went through marriage preparations classes with the Archdiocese of Denver and married her son\u2019s father. Her seven-year-old son now has three younger siblings \u2014 the most recent is only a few weeks old.\u00a0\nCastillo never regretted her decision to give her son life and her unplanned and difficult pregnancy strengthened her family and their faith. It also reinvigorated her pro-life support and her passion to help women who find themselves facing an unplanned pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, Castillo works with 1,250 college and high school campuses \u2014 41 in Colorado\u2014 to let expectant moms know: \u201cThere are people who will care for you and your baby and there are many organizations and resources that exist to help.\u201d\u00a0\nThese\u00a0resources stretch to\u00a0communities of all sizes throughout the state and they address some of the cultural barriers\u00a0for Hispanic\u00a0women, Castillo said.\u00a0Organizations\u00a0and government agencies\u00a0exist that can help with affordable insurance, housing, bill pay assistance, job placement\u00a0and food.\u00a0\u00a0Lower and no income moms can still have access to high quality\u00a0OB/GYNs and\u00a0pediatricians, and these services are not just bi-lingual, they can address cultural differences\u00a0for pregnant moms\u00a0in rural Colorado\u00a0to\u00a0downtown Denver,\u00a0Castillo said.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s an unfortunate narrative out there that the pro-life community only cares about the\u00a0unborn child and it\u2019s just not true, said Castillo,\u00a0Development\u00a0Director of Students for Life. We see the mom and baby as equal humans needing our help and support, she added.\u00a0\n\u201cThe moms need to know there are people and groups who will love them, they need to know they are still loved,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cThere is no question these women would be met with love and the help they need.\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why this mom\u00a0who faced her own unplanned pregnancy is pleading for voters to vote yes on Colorado\u2019s Prop 115 this November.\u00a0\n\u201cOur mission is to make these supportive services known. There should never be reason that seeking late-term abortions is the answer,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cOur moms and pre-born babies deserve better. Our state should do better.\u201d\u00a0\nRespect Life ministries and programs supporting moms, like Castillo, and their unplanned pregnancies are supported by the Archbishop\u2019s Catholic Appeal.
