By 80%-14%, those surveyed opposed that idea, including 65% of Republicans and 83% of independents. By 53%-39%, they supported a federal law ensuring access to abortion.\u201d\nBut 2024 Republicans don\u2019t care how wildly out of touch and dangerous their extreme stances on abortion bans are \u2013 they\u2019re still tripping over each other to endorse a national ban and chase the MAGA base.\u00a0\nThe Messenger: Would you sign a six week abortion ban or not?\nTrump: \u201cI\u2019m looking at all [options].\u201d\nDeSantis: \u201cDobbs returned the issue to the elected representatives of the people. And so I think that there\u2019s, there\u2019s role for both the federal and the states.\u201d\nWolf Blitzer: \u201cWould you support a six-week ban nationwide?\u201d\nPence: \u201cWell, of course. Look \u2014 I\u2019m pro-life. I don\u2019t apologize for it. I believe that we\u2019ve got to do everything in our power to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law. And I\u2019d support federal legislation in that regard if I was in the Congress or had any other job here in town.\u201d\nNewsmax: \u201cYour colleague in the Senate \u2013 also your colleague from South Carolina \u2013 Lindsey Graham is pushing for a 15-week federal abortion ban, something that\u2019s going to be an issue come the next election. Would a President Scott sign that bill into law?\u201d\nScott: \u201cEvery day, I would sign that bill into law. I would sign the most conservative pro-life legislation you can bring to my desk.\u201d\nMeg Kinnard, Associated Press: \u201cYes of course I would sign\u2019 federal ban, Haley says.\u201d\nUSA Today: \u201cPresidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would sign into law a 15-week national abortion ban if he were president, a departure from his previous stance when he said the issue should be left up to individual states.\u201d\nWall Street Journal: \u201c[Suarez] said he would support a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of mother.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\n\n\n\nJoin Us\n\n\nEmail address*\n\n\n\nPhone number\n\n\n\nZip code*\n\n\n Sign up to get texts.
