Russo (Art Lien) \nShareThe court has just one case today to close out the argument portion of the February sitting, but it\u2019s a big one.\nIn June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, the justices will consider whether Louisiana\u2019s law requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals conflicts with the court\u2019s decision just four years ago in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt striking down a similar law in Texas. There is also the cross-petition from Louisiana about whether abortion providers have third-party standing to challenge health and safety regulations on behalf of their patients.\nToday, virtually every seat in the courtroom will be filled, which doesn\u2019t always happen even in some blockbuster cases.\nBird\u2019s eye view of the courtroom during argument in June Medical Services v. Russo (Art Lien)\n\nIn the public gallery, Kathaleen Pittman, the director of the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport, which is owned by June Medical, is here. Nancy Northrup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the clinic, is here, as is Amy Metzler Ritter, the chair of CRR.\nAmy Hagstrom-Miller, the CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the consortium of health care and abortion clinics at the center of the Texas case, is also here.\nI was told by CRR that none of the several doctors identified in court papers as \u201cDoe\u201d would be in attendance today. Their particular circumstances with respect to the admitting-privileges requirement will be the subject of numerous questions.\nAt the south end of the front row of the public section sit two U.S. senators who have evidently taken up Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 invitation to attend a session of the court. One is Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana who is trained as a physician. He is among the 207 members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of Louisiana organized by Americans United for Life, a prominent anti-abortion group.\nThe other is Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is among 197 different members of Congress who signed a brief in support of the challengers. The difference in the number of signers of the competing briefs probably does not carry any great weight with the justices.\nIn the bar section, there is a contingent from the American Civil Liberties Union, including Louise Melling, the deputy director and director of its Center for Liberty, which oversees abortion rights and other issues. Also in the courtroom today is Ilyse Hogue, the president of the National Abortion Rights Action League.\nAt the counsel table on the left, Julie Rikelman of CRR, who will argue for June Medical Services, arrives with her co-counsel, including Travis Tu of CRR and Jeffrey Fisher of Stanford Law School and O\u2019Melveny & Myers.\nMeanwhile, the Louisiana entourage arrives to defend the state\u2019s law, including Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill, who will argue the case. They are joined in the bar section by U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana\u2019s 4th district, who will video tweet afterwards to say that he helped defend the law in the federal district court before being elected to Congress in 2016 from the district that includes Shreveport.\nAbortion clinics in the Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans areas are the focus of this litigation, but because Hope Medical Clinic is in Shreveport, there is a bit more attention on that medium-sized city.\nThis might be a good place to mention that your reporter once lived in Shreveport, which is in northwest Louisiana and might be said to have more in common with button-down Dallas and conservative East Texas than it does with the \u201claissez les bon temps rouler\u201d vibe of New Orleans and southern Louisiana. This Chicago native was a bit of a fish out of water in that sleepy burg. I\u2019ll put it this way. Seemingly right after I left after two years at a newspaper job there, the region gained two, um, cultural innovations that would have made it a more interesting place to live: a minor league hockey franchise and riverboat gambling. Also, somewhat improbably, the area became one of those non-Hollywood film production locations, so you might occasionally read that one star or another was arrested in a local bar fight \u201cwhile he was filming a movie in Shreveport.\u201d\nAmong the representatives of groups supporting the Louisiana law here today are Steven Aden and Clark Forsythe of Americans United for Life and Jordan Lorence and John Bursch of the Alliance Defending Freedom.\nJust 10 minutes before the start of court, Ashley Kavanaugh, the wife of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, arrives and takes her seat in the VIP section. She is soon followed by Joanna Breyer, the wife of Justice Stephen Breyer, and Jane Roberts, the wife of the chief justice.\nTop court officers also fill most of the seats reserved for them. But retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, who provided the crucial fifth vote for striking down the Texas regulations in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, is not in the courtroom today.\nAs the argument proceeds, demonstrators on both sides of the abortion issue are holding their competing rallies on the sidewalk outside the court. No one inside the courtroom is aware of the contretemps that Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, is evidently causing with his remarks to the abortion rights demonstrators, which will later elicit a public response from the chief justice.\nAmy Howe has this blog\u2019s main account of the hourlong argument.\nJust minutes into Rikelman\u2019s presentation on behalf of June Medical Services, a cellphone chime goes off, followed by a bell. The culprit is not evident, though it does not appear to be a member of the court. Whenever I appear before a student group or others to discuss the court, I mention the time in 2017 when Breyer inadvertently brought his phone into the courtroom and, of course, it rang. The students whose phones have long been regulated in school really identify with the justice.\nWhen the mystery phone isn\u2019t pinging and chiming, as it does a couple more times throughout the hour, there are two distinct vibes to the argument. One revolves around the fact that the newest members of the court are facing their first argument in an abortion case. Justice Neil Gorsuch does not ask a single question. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, has quite a few.\n\u201cAre you saying that admitting privileges laws are always unconstitutional, such that we don\u2019t have to look at the facts state by state?\u201d he asks Rikelman. \u201cOr are you saying that actually you do look at the facts state by state, and in some states, admitting privileges laws could be constitutional, if they impose no burdens?\u201d\nShe holds her ground in several variations of the question, maintaining that such laws serve no valid state interest.\nKavanaugh asks five questions of Rikelman, one of Principal Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, who is arguing on behalf of the U.S. government in support of Louisiana, and none of Murrill.\nFor the other members of the court, the vibe is that positions are well staked out on this divisive issue.\nJustice Samuel Alito, a member of the minority in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, sharply questions Rikelman on the third-party standing of the abortion providers, finding several of her answers \u201camazing\u201d or \u201chighly debatable.\u201d\nRoberts asks a question (Art Lien)\nAs for the other dissenters in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, Justice Clarence Thomas is silent as usual while Roberts asks questions that will be highly scrutinized but don\u2019t seem to reveal his views.\n\u201cCounsel, do you agree that the inquiry under Hellerstedt is a factual one that has to proceed state-by-state?\u201d he asks of Rikelman. He poses a variation of that question to both Murrill and Wall.\n\u201c[W]hy do you look at each state differently if the benefits of the law\u2014they\u2019re not going to change from state-to-state?\u201d the chief asks Wall.\nThe remaining members of the majority in Whole Woman\u2019s Health\u2014Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\u2014each have vigorous questions that show their skepticism of the Louisiana law\u2019s constitutionality.\nGinsburg ponders the issue at hand (Art Lien)\nGinsburg gets a laugh when she asks Rikelman a friendly question about Craig v. Boren, a 1976 case involving disparate legal drinking ages for young men and women, in which she filed an amicus brief when she was with the ACLU. The decision helps bolster the abortion providers\u2019 third-party standing claim.\n\u201cYou made a point about Craig versus Boren, that the ostensible purpose of the law was to save the vulnerable young men from the evils of 3.2 beer?\u201d Ginsburg says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct, your honor, and the court allowed the saloon keeper to bring the third-party standing claim,\u201d Rikelman says.\nGinsburg seeks repeatedly to knock the state\u2019s rationales for its admitting-privileges requirements.\n\u201cIs it not the fact that most hospitals in Louisiana, in order to get admitting privileges, you have to admit a certain number of patients?\u201d she asks Murrill. \u201cAbortion providers will never, \u2026 if they\u2019re not also doing obstetrics and gynecology, they will never qualify because their patients don\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d\nBreyer, who wrote the majority opinion in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, has an exchange with Wall late in the argument that seems to summarize the ideological gridlock over abortion rights.\n\u201cHow do you deal with this?\u201d Breyer asks Wall. \u201cI have read the briefs. I understand there are good arguments on both sides. Indeed, in the country people have very strong feelings and a lot of people morally think it\u2019s wrong and a lot of people morally think the opposite is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cAnd in [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.] Casey, and the later cases,\u201d he adds, \u201cI think personally the court is struggling with the problem of what kind of rule of law do you have in a country that contains both sorts of people.\u201d\nWhen the argument is over, the clinic director, the advocates and the politicians make their way quickly to the court\u2019s plaza to address the media, and then to the wide sidewalk, where \u201cboth sides\u201d of this intractable issue hold their loud, competing rallies.\n\n\n\n\nPosted in What's Happening Now\n\n\nCases: June Medical Services LLC v.
