The students from the Rochester area Students for Life groups joined with the Fredrick Douglass Foundation of New York and Feminists Choosing Life of New York on the anniversary of the most famous speech to be delivered in their city. In 1852, Fredrick Douglass delivered the speech \u201cWhat to the Slave is the 4th of July?\u201d in Rochester. Following in the footsteps of our great Rochester forebearers the students ask the question: What is the 4th of July to the pre-born?\nThe message, Black Preborn Lives Matter, was vandalized.\nIn a state where abortion is legal until the point of birth for any or no reason, the answer to this question is bound to be bleak. On the 4th of July we remember the words of our country\u2019s founders, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\nClick here to watch the video of pro-lifers painting the message.\u00a0\nNot that we are made equal after reaching a certain stage or by being \u201cwanted\u201d but that we are CREATED equal, from the indisputable moment of our creation. Not that we are granted rights by government after proving ourselves worthy of them but that we are ENDOWED with INALIENABLE RIGHTS, the first and cornerstone of which is the right to life.\nWe remember \u201cthat to secure these rights\u201d (the first of which is the right to life) \u201cGovernments are instituted among men\u201d and \u201cThat when any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the people\u2019s right to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.\u201d To state that the government of New York has failed to secure these rights is undeniable. To state that the government of New York has been destructive of these ends is an understatement. To state that the government of New York should be altered is obvious.\nThe Declaration of Independence reads, \u201cAll experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.\u201d However, for the generation of survivors these evils have never been sufferable, nor will they be. When a child can be legally killed for the first 9 months of his/her life, how can we stand by in silence? When a deeply racist organization establishes eugenic facilities with government funding, how can we not speak up? When an entire quarter (or more) of our generation is not with us because they were deemed unworthy of life, how can we not fight for the next generation?\n\u201cLet facts be submitted to a candid world.\u201d The fact is that Black Pre-Born Lives Matter. This is the undeniable truth that has been painted in front of the Planned Parenthood abortion facility in downtown Rochester. At a time in our country when the issue of inequality is at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds, we must stand up for the most vulnerable and oppressed people in our society. Pre-born children have been stripped of their humanity by the state of New York because of their physical appearance. A statue of Fredrick Douglass was torn down in Rochester the same week, and yet the buildings that house oppression and death still stand.\n\nIt seems darkly appropriate that Planned Parenthood, the organization that has killed infinitely more African Americans than any other racist organization in history, has the word \u201cpreborn\u201d blotted out right in front\u00a0 of their facility. Planned Parenthood, the organization founded on the principle to \u201cexterminate the Negro population,\u201d no doubt agrees with the vandal\u2019s black paint that marks which black lives matter and which ones don\u2019t. Planned Parenthood, the organization that feels it has the right to endow inalienable rights, overlooks a hateful message towards the preborn.\nGuest post by Ben Chernjavsky, President of Monroe Community College Students for Life\n\n Post Views: 1,596\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
