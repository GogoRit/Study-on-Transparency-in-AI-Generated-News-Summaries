The student senate also handles funding requests and, to date, has not taken the same viewpoint discriminatory stance.\nUNC Chapel Hill\u2019s chapter of Students for Life, one of the country\u2019s largest pro-life advocacy organizations, responded with a statement expressing dismay and urging Student Body President Taliajah Vann to rescind the order and live up to her campaign promise that she would \u201chelp every member of the student body.\u201d\u00a0\nAs a public institution, UNC Chapel Hill is bound by the First Amendment, which precludes the school from discriminating against student groups based on viewpoint. The student government is therefore constitutionally required to distribute funds in a viewpoint-neutral manner. Additionally, UNC Chapel Hill makes strong commitments to free speech, earning FIRE\u2019s highest, \u201cgreen light\u201d rating. FIRE\u2019s letter to Vann asks her administration to immediately rescind the unconstitutional order and commit to viewpoint neutrality.\n\u201cUNC Chapel Hill\u2019s student government cannot declare itself the arbiter of which opinions are acceptable,\u201d said Greenberg. \u201cWe call on these student leaders to uphold their constituents\u2019 free speech rights by doling out funds in a viewpoint-neutral manner.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit student rights organization dedicated to defending and sustaining the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought \u2014 the most essential qualities of liberty. FIRE recognizes that colleges and universities play a vital role in preserving free thought within a free society. To this end, we place a special emphasis on defending the individual rights of students and faculty members on our nation\u2019s campuses, including freedom of speech, freedom of association, due process, legal equality, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience.\nCONTACT:\nKatie Kortepeter, Media Relations Manager, FIRE: 215-717-3473; media@thefire.org\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion\nFaculty Rights\nFree Speech\nFreedom of Conscience\nSpeech Codes\nStudent Government\nStudent Rights\nViewpoint Discrimination\nUniversity of North Carolina - Chapel Hill\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: Student Government Executive Branch Bans Funding to Pro-Life Student Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Recent Articles\n      \n\n\nFIRE\u2019s award-winning Newsdesk covers the free speech news you need to stay informed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                West Texas A&M President cancels student charity drag show for second time\n               \n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n                  West Texas A&M President Wendler enforced his unconstitutional prior restraint by canceling a student-organized charity drag show for the second time. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Supreme Court considers when government \u2018persuasion\u2019 becomes unconstitutional coercion\n               \n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n                  In today\u2019s oral argument for NRA v.
