Mike Kelly (R-PA)\u00a0met with Board of Directors of Pro-Life of Mercer County at his Sharon District Office. Rep. Kelly and the board members discussed\u00a0the pro-life movement in a post-Roe v. Wade world and other pro-life initiatives.\u00a0\"The pro-life movement has always been a grassroots effort led by great, God-fearing people like those I met with here in Mercer County,\"\u00a0Kelly said.\u00a0\"Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade and put this issue rightfully in the hands of lawmakers, I hope to continue this dialogue with local leaders to ensure all lives are protected moving forward.\"\u00a0BACKGROUNDFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on abortion in June, Rep. Kelly is meeting with key stakeholders and officials from pro-life organizations, adoption & foster care facilities, crisis pregnancy centers, and women's care centers throughout the 16th Congressional District. The goal of the meetings is to learn more about each organization's work and how, if at all, the federal government can assist in their efforts to protect children and strengthen local families.\nFriday's visit was Rep. Kelly's third stop on this tour throughout the 16th Congressional District. He previously visited the Women's Care Center of Erie County in Erie on July 1 and The Bair Foundation in Lawrence County on July 12.\nThe visit follows Rep. Kelly's op-ed\u00a0published in\u00a0Newsweek\u00a0highlighting his pro-life legislation, the\u00a0Heartbeat Protection Act.\n      Issues:Pro-Life & Family ValuesContact UsWashington DC Office1707 Longworth House Office BuildingWashington, DC\u00a0\u00a020515Phone: (202) 225-5406Fax: (202) 225-3103Erie District Office17 S.
