(Campaign photos)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the race to represent Homer and other lower Kenai Peninsula communities in the Alaska State House, the two main contenders differ on some key issues, like abortion rights, support for a constitutional convention and ranked choice voting.\nIn the August primary, sitting legislator Republican Sarah Vance got 52% of the vote with nonpartisan Louis \u201cLouie\u201d Flora getting 40%. Nonpartisan Ginger Bryant, a self-described \u201cnew kid on the block,\u201d got 8%. All three will be on the ballot next week.\nIn Juneau, Vance has shown support for legislation restricting abortions and budget amendments. In 2020, she sponsored her own anti-abortion legislation, which was never heard in committee.\nThis past April, the two-term legislator supported an amendment to the budget that aimed to eliminate state funding for abortion services. During a floor speech in favor of the amendment, Vance talked about her unplanned pregnancy when she was 23, which she was in denial about \u201cbecause I had a two-year plan and I was being responsible.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so I took a pregnancy test, Madam Speaker, but I didn\u2019t believe it until I heard her heartbeat and I saw the little bean on the screen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want us to remember that this is more than just dollars or what court orders. This is the very lives of our future.\u201d\nThe Alaska Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the right to abortion under the privacy and equal protection clauses of the Alaska Constitution, and has ruled that Alaska Medicaid must cover medically necessary abortions. That House amendment didn\u2019t make it to the final budget, though the Senate\u2019s proposal to do something symbolically similar did.\u00a0\nFlora highlighted the differences between him and Vance, including their positions on abortion rights, during a Homer Chamber of Commerce candidate forum in mid-October. Flora is a commercial fisher and was a longtime staff member to former Homer Rep. Paul Seaton, who Vance defeated in 2018.\u00a0\n\u201cI support medical freedom, including the freedom for women to make reproductive health decisions with their medical provider,\u201d Flora said.\u00a0\nIn the Alaska Beacon questionnaire, the lifelong Alaskan called himself a \u201cpro-freedom and pro-life candidate\u201d when it comes to abortion rights. During an interview with the Beacon in September, he said he is \u201cabsolutely for reproductive choice in Alaska,\u201d and clarified what he meant by \u201cpro-life.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that a lot of people that have taken on the term \u2018pro-life\u2019 are not there after birth; I think they\u2019re pro-birth. But if they\u2019re voting to defund education programs and defund student nutrition programs and not willing to work on gun violence abatement, you know, they don\u2019t have the ability to say that they\u2019re \u2018pro-life,\u2019\u201d he said.\nBryant, a conflict resolution practitioner and event center owner, is pro-abortion rights. \u201cI want to be clear; I am pro-choice. We need to protect our choice,\u201d she said during the Home Chamber candidate forum.\u00a0\nOn what abortion policies and laws Alaska should follow, Bryant wrote in the Beacon candidate questionnaire, \u201cI believe Alaskan Privacy is the corner stone of our Community Culture and is Sacrosanct.\u201d\u00a0\nVance did not fill out the Beacon questionnaire or reply to numerous requests for an interview.\u00a0\n Constitutional convention ballot measure\n\nBryant and Flora are both against having a constitutional convention.\n\u201cIf we go with a constitutional convention, it\u2019s going to kneecap a lot of our businesses and a lot of our forward progression,\u201d Bryant said during the candidate forum.\u00a0\nFlora said Alaska has a strong constitution in regard to, for example, resource development, protections for public employees and the right to privacy. He said a convention could harm the state\u2019s economy.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we need to be careful about the potential that outside interests could come into the process and take away some of our Alaskan rights, and we also need to be just careful of the kind of chaos that it would cause in the economy,\u201d he said.\nFlora did note that he is in support of putting the Permanent Fund dividend in the constitution, but thinks that change can be done through the constitutional amendment process. \n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s critical moving forward, as you know, in terms of balancing our budget and not having the annual battle down in Juneau about the Permanent Fund dividend,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m a yes vote on constitutionalizing the dividend and no vote on opening up the whole shebang\u201d\u00a0\nWhile Vance said she would respect whatever the voters decided, she said she would be voting yes on the ballot question \u201cbecause I believe in you having the ability to decide what your constitutional rights should be.\u201d\u00a0\nShe encouraged yes voters to stay engaged with the process so it turns out as they hope.\n\u201cAs with every other discussion, whether that\u2019s Judicial Council, whether that\u2019s the dividend, parent\u2019s choice in education, it is our responsibility to be involved in that process, and not just wait until the final vote comes,\u201d Vance said.\n Ranked choice voting\n\nCalling the system \u201cconfusing,\u201d Vance said at the candidate forum that her top legislative issue for the next session is to repeal ranked choice voting. She said that\u2019s the No. 1 issue people across House District 6 are talking about.\n\u201cAnd so I am composing a bill that will return it to the way that we had it before. Simply get back to one person one vote that you have been used to seeing on your ballot,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nBryant said she supports Alaska\u2019s new voting system. As a result of ranked choice voting, she said she was able to provide a third voice in the race that was not \u201ca reflection or the same two voices that you\u2019ve been hearing.\u201d\u00a0\nFlora also supports ranked choice voting and said the state is learning how the system works. He likes that it eliminates the party primary process, creates a more moderate electorate and brings more voices to the table.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely premature to be casting doubts on the law and then talk about repealing it when we have barely had one cycle to see it work,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLower Kenai Peninsula House candidates differ on abortion, constitutional convention\nby Lisa Phu, Alaska Beacon November 3, 2022\nLower Kenai Peninsula House candidates differ on abortion, constitutional convention\nby Lisa Phu, Alaska Beacon November 3, 2022\n In the race to represent Homer and other lower Kenai Peninsula communities in the Alaska State House, the two main contenders differ on some key issues, like abortion rights, support for a constitutional convention and ranked choice voting.\nIn the August primary, sitting legislator Republican Sarah Vance got 52% of the vote with nonpartisan Louis \u201cLouie\u201d Flora getting 40%.
