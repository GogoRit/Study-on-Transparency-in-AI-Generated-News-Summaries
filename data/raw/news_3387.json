She recently spoke out against a pro-life policy, but her statements sure seem contrary to her signature message. Let\u2019s discuss her contrasting beliefs:\u00a0\nLizzo disavowed Texas abortion policy.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the 2022 South by South Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival held in Austin, Texas, Lizzo expressed embarrassment over Texan abortion policies as a Houston native\u2014namely, the Texas Heartbeat Law. This law bans abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, and new data has shown just how effective this ban has been in saving preborn lives: in the first month of this law being enacted, abortions were down by more than 50% compared to a year prior.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe law\u2019s definitely working for life\u2014but it\u2019s not working for Lizzo, apparently. During a keynote session at the festival, Lizzo said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to rep Houston, but I\u2019m not proud to rep Texas politics right now\u2026The abortion ban is atrocious. Mind your business. Stay out of my body. This is not political.\u201d She also complained that pro-life politicians were \u201call up in your uterus.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nInstead of focusing on fixing the extreme human rights issue the United States has in legal abortion, Lizzo also inferred that there were other more important problems at hand. Giving no ear to the babies killed and women harmed by the abortion industry, Lizzo stated that she felt let down by politicians, and that they needed to change other things on a \u201csystemic level.\u201d Her dismissal of the intrinsic worth of preborn babies and motherhood has left us scratching our heads, however.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIsn\u2019t her music all about women\u2019s empowerment?\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, that\u2019s actually her brand. She\u2019s well-known for songs that paint her and females in general as strong, independent women who have the ability to do what they want. For example, her song \u2018Truth Hurts,\u2019 the longest running Billboard Hot 100 number one song for a female rapper, talks about solving problems like a \u201cgoddess.\u201d Another one of her hit songs entitled \u201cGood as Hell\u201d says, \u201cCome now, come dry your eyes, you know you a star, you can touch the sky, I know that it\u2019s hard but you have to try.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nObviously, Lizzo promotes women\u2019s capabilities and encourages them that they can do anything, but her comments about abortion seem to undermine this general attitude of empowerment. In fact, these comments leave us doubtful that she really supports them doing everything\u2014like being a mother and a successful career woman.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, that is the toxic mindset of the abortion lobby. Despite touting \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d and donning bubble-gum pink, abortion supporters firmly believe and market the idea that women cannot be successful without abortion\u2014that women need abortion to be successful. That\u2019s why abortion supporters scream about \u201cabortion rights\u201d and cling to the murderous industry that kills their children and harms them in process. Simply put, they just don\u2019t think women can do it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat\u2019s where the pro-life movement has to disagree.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn reality, we value and respect women much more than the abortion industry because we know that a) abortion is killing preborn women and men, and b) women don\u2019t need abortions to be successful. They have the ability to be a mother AND to finish school and be successful professionally. In fact, to think otherwise (that women have to choose between being a mother and being successful in a career) is rather outdated. Someone needs to tell the abortion lobby that it\u2019s not the 1950s anymore.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInstead of believing that women can\u2019t without an abortion, the pro-life movement asserts that women can. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy\u2014as Lizzo acknowledges in her song \u201cGood as Hell\u201d\u2014but it means that women just need support from their communities in their journey. And who doesn\u2019t need support? That\u2019s why the pro-life movement strives to help pregnant and parenting women in every way possible\u2014like Students for Life of America\u2019s Standing with You initiative which serves women and their families mentally and physically.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a proponent of women\u2019s empowerment, Lizzo needs to rethink her abortion stance.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can\u2019t serve two gods at once, and that truth is made very clear in this instance. Women\u2019s empowerment and abortion devotion are warring ideals, and not even catchy lyrics can change that these values are at odds with one another. The pro-life movement embraces preborn children and women in a way that the abortion lobby never can, and our door is always open. Lizzo, we invite you to bring your positive energy to the side of the abortion battle which truly loves and supports women and their babies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,134\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle Schoolpro-lifeSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
