Now they are filling that gap.\n\u201cSeventy-three percent of women are getting abortions because of financial reasons, and those are 100-percent preventable,\u201d Emily said. \u201cSo, we thought, \u2018What if we crowdfunded for these women and raised money and paid their bills for them to relieve those financial burdens?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nThey began to do exactly that.\u00a0\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nLet Them Live became an official non-profit approximately a year ago and is filling a huge need in serving these women.\nEmily Berning spoke of the couple\u2019s work filling the big gap found in pro-life work related to providing financial help.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re saving real lives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve saved about 29 babies from abortion in the last year.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cWe\u2019re saving real lives ... We\u2019ve saved about 29 babies from abortion in the last year.\u201d\nAssisting abortion-minded women across America\nBased in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the primary mission of Let Them Live is to help abortion-minded women financially, regardless of their location.\n\u201cSome women come to us directly, and we connect them with a pregnancy center, helping them get their ultrasound and things like that,\u201d Emily said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe also have sidewalk counselors at 40 Days for Life,\u201d she added. \u201cObviously, these women are in immediate danger of abortion and need financial support. We had two moms referred to us that way just recently.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how Atoria, who resides in California, learned about Let Them Live.\u00a0\n\u201cShe was really depressed, about 18 weeks pregnant at the time, and her boyfriend left her,\u201d Emily said.\nHomeless and living in her car, Atoria had no money. Although she reached out to Let Them Live, she was skeptical about the assistance the organization could give from across the country.\u00a0\n\u201cShe basically said, \u2018I appreciate you wanting to help me, but I can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d Emily said. \u201cShe told us she was going to go have an abortion \u2026 and then she was going to jump off a parking garage.\u201d\u00a0\nEmily sprang into action and flew out to California \u201cto be with her and show her that\u2019s not what she needed to do \u2013 abortion and suicide were not her only options.\u201d\u00a0\nLet Them Live helped Atoria get on her feet, finding her an apartment and paying six months\u2019 rent plus groceries, gas for her car and other bills.\u00a0\nAtoria gave birth to a baby boy on March 2, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAtoria and her baby/Photo rights reserved\n\n\u201cWe got so close to her during her pregnancy, my husband and I were actually in the delivery room while her baby was being born,\u201d Emily said. \u201cIt was really amazing to be there and see all of that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEmily and Nathan Berning with Atoria's baby boy/Photo rights reserved\n\nMiriam\u2019s story is similar in some ways. Living in North Carolina, the young woman was on her way to an abortion center. Somehow, she learned about Let Them Live and reached out to Emily before going inside the abortion facility.\n\u201cMiriam was offered money from the National Abortion Federation to have an abortion,\u201d Emily said. \u201cShe returned it and took our help instead. She had her baby, and I was able to go visit her.\u201d\u00a0\nTweet This: \u201cMiriam was offered money from the National Abortion Federation to have an abortion .. She returned it and took our help instead.\"\nMiriam has been trying to finish school in hopes of getting a better job in order to better care for herself and her children; she is a single mother of four.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nMiriam's baby Alexi/Photo rights reserved\n\nLet Them Lives paid her phone bill, electricity, internet, and purchased a laptop so she can do her classes online, Emily said.\nRelieving financial stress\n\u201cI actually pay all the bills,\u201d Emily said. \u201cThere\u2019s really not a lot that we won\u2019t pay as long as we can pay it directly.\u201d\nLet Them Live also supports the pregnant moms they serve in other ways.\n\u201cWe also offer a registry for the moms, said Emily. \u201cMany of these moms won\u2019t get a baby shower \u2013 they won\u2019t get anything nice for their baby, so we do that for them as a sort of \u2018thanks for taking this journey with us and for choosing life.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe mom about to give birth in New York didn\u2019t have anything for her baby, so she has 182 items on her registry list,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also an emotional support for them, being able to talk to them as a peer,\u201d said Emily. \u201cA lot of the girls are my age and younger. We\u2019re taking the journey with them \u2013 we become just like family when we help them.\u201d\nCrowdfunding for moms\nLet Them Live seeks donations through crowdfunding and the organization\u2019s website. Nathan built the group\u2019s social media presence.\u00a0\n\u201cAll of our original donors, all of our donors really, have come through social media,\u201d Emily said. \u201cWe have many donors who do smaller contributions, and we have a handful of high-dollar donors who love our mission and want to see it grow.\u201d\nTo that end, the Bernings are spreading the word about their organization. Emily was featured in February on The Daily Signal and in March on The Epoch Times. The group wants to increase their partnership with pregnancy centers as well.\n\u201cA woman who goes into a pregnancy center typically doesn\u2019t know about our resource. If she says she\u2019s planning to have an abortion, she\u2019s a candidate for our help,\u201d Emily said. \u201cA pregnant woman who comes in and is thinking about having an abortion or has one scheduled because of financial reasons, she would be right for us.\u201d\nFinding and giving inspiration\nThe organization\u2019s inspiration comes from the film Schindler\u2019s List, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2018.\n\u201cWhoever saves one life saves the world entire \u2013 that\u2019s kind of our motto,\u201d Emily said. \u201cEveryone who is part of our organization, including our donors, has saved at least one life. That\u2019s a really big thing to say.\u00a0\n\u201cThe work that we do wouldn\u2019t be possible without our donors and their contributions,\u201d she said. \u201cOne at a time, we\u2019re going to save lives.\u201d\nAs more abortion-minded women learn about Let Them Live, through sidewalk counselors, pregnancy centers, or by searching the internet, more unborn lives are saved from abortion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get our name out and let pregnancy centers know we are a resource,\u201d Emily said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with just a handful of them. We want to get in contact with more pregnancy centers so we can help more moms.\u201d\u00a0\nClick HERE to learn more about Let Them Live. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nabortion\npregnancy help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGayle Irwin\n\nGayle M.
