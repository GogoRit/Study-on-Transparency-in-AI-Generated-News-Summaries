Wade decision that legalized the procedure in 1973.Such laws, often referred to as \u201cfetal heartbeat bills,\u201d ban abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which can happen around six weeks into pregnancy, although a timeframe typically isn\u2019t specified in the measures.Swift court actions in states including Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee revived laws stalled under Roe in the decision\u2019s wake. That has left some people who were planning abortions \u2014 and the clinics lined up to provide them \u2014 scrambling.Here\u2019s a look at what has happened following the ruling, where that leaves residents of affected states, and what may come next:\n\nWHERE ARE THE LAWS IN EFFECT?Stalled laws were reimposed in Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee within days of the Supreme Court ruling. In September, Texas became the first state to successfully impose such a law, with the dozen or so other states seeing theirs placed on hold under Roe. Similar laws are the subject of court action in at least four other states.\nOhio was able to reimpose its \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, which had twice been vetoed because of constitutional considerations under Roe, within hours of that case\u2019s reversal. At the request of Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, a federal judge lifted the stay that had prevented enforcement since the law was signed in 2019. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood sued in the Ohio Supreme Court on behalf of a group of abortion providers Wednesday, arguing the law also violates the state constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d law went into effect Monday, after an injunction blocking the law was removed. Tennessee\u2019s took effect Wednesday. In Georgia, where a federal judge declared the \u201cheartbeat restriction\u201d unconstitutional in 2020, a federal appeals court Friday has given parties three weeks to file briefs addressing the effect the Supreme Court ruling on the state\u2019s appeal of the lower court ruling. \n\nQ: IS ABORTION STILL LEGAL IN THESE STATES?A: Yes, but only until cardiac activity is detected. That can happen around six weeks of gestational age, which is before many women even know they are pregnant.Further, abortion rights groups, clinics and some faith groups are making available resources to people who still want abortions, including financial help and transportation to other states. Meanwhile, abortion opponents, including Ohio\u2019s governor, are ramping up resources for families, in hopes that the new restrictions prompt more people to carry their pregnancies to term. Republican legislative leaders in Ohio and South Carolina have raised the possibility of further tightening their states\u2019 abortion restrictions to full bans later this year. Tennessee\u2019s other abortion ban, known as the so-called trigger ban, is set to restrict abortion in that state almost entirely in less than a month. WHAT DO THE LAWS PROHIBIT, EXACTLY?The laws generally prohibit abortions of \u201can unborn human individual whose fetal heartbeat has been detected.\u201d That terminology \u2014 used widely in anti-abortion legislation across the country \u2014 does not easily translate to medical science. \n\nThat\u2019s because at the point where advanced technology can detect that first visual flutter, as early as six weeks into pregnancy, the embryo isn\u2019t yet a fetus, and it doesn\u2019t have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus eight weeks after fertilization, according to medical experts.Abortion rights advocates, civil rights attorneys and some abortion foes favor calling the laws \u201csix-week abortion bans.\u201d That, too, is misleading. Most \u201cheartbeat\u201d laws make no mention of a particular gestational age after which abortion is illegal. What they ban are most abortions after the point when a state-sanctioned detection method administered in good faith by a medical professional can detect cardiac activity.If no cardiac activity is found, an abortion can go forward. Under Ohio\u2019s law, women must wait 24 hours, then get a second ultrasound to again assure no flutter is present before the procedure can move forward.\n\nARE THERE ANY EXCEPTIONS?Yes, but it depends on the state. The Ohio and Tennessee laws make exceptions for the life of the mother or for risk of \u201csubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d This could include preeclampsia, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, premature rupture of membranes or inevitable miscarriage. Neither makes exceptions for incest or rape, including rape of a child. Both laws also specify that a woman\u2019s mental health does not qualify for an exemption.South Carolina\u2019s law requires an attempt to detect a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d once a doctor thinks a pregnant woman is at least eight weeks along. The state allows exceptions for when the woman\u2019s life is in danger, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s law makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest, if the woman files a police report first. It also allows for abortions when the life of the mother is at risk or when a pregnancy is deemed \u201cmedically futile,\u201d generally due to a serious medical condition in the fetus.WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATORS?A person who performs an abortion in violation of the ban in Ohio could be charged with a fifth-degree felony, which carries a penalty of probation or six to 12 months in prison and a fine of up to $2,500. Under the law, a doctor invoking one of the law\u2019s exceptions also must specify in writing the medical condition invoked, place a record of that decision in the patient\u2019s file and maintain it for seven years. Failing to keep proper paperwork is subject to a penalty of up to $20,000 for each instance. Under Tennessee\u2019s law, performing an abortion when cardiac activity is present is a felony, subjecting doctors to up to 15 years in prison. A doctor guilty of violating South Carolina\u2019s abortion law faces a felony conviction carrying a penalty of $20,000 and up to two years in prison, or both.Pregnant people are not held liable under any of the laws, and they are given the option to bring civil action for wrongful death if their pregnancy is terminated without an attempt to detect a \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIE CARR SMYTH\n\n\n                Smyth has covered government and politics from Columbus, Ohio, for The Associated Press since 2006.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
