United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is pledging support for those suffering from invisible impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including women and girls whose access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health care may be disrupted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Executive Director of the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, Natalia Kanem, said the Fund\u2019s work is ramping up even as the novel coronavirus continues to test health care systems around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTweet URL\n\n\nAs we continue responding to the #coronavirus outbreak, @UNFPA is calling for renewed action to provide life-saving sexual and reproductive health for the world's most vulnerable.See @Atayeshe's statement: https://t.co/2ELQc2ClIx#COVID19 pic.twitter.com/iWppYYdJsl\n\n\nUNFPA\n\nUNFPA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe warned that women, girls and health workers must not be overlooked as the world responds to the greatest health crisis in a century.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWomen and girls most vulnerable\u00a0\nAs in most crises, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to critical sexual and reproductive health services and hampered authorities\u2019 ability to respond to gender-based violence, at a time when women and girls need these services most.\u00a0\u00a0\nUNFPA is helping governments prioritize the special needs of women and girls \u2013 often the most vulnerable in times of crises \u2013 in line with the Fund\u2019s goals of ending unmet need for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, gender-based violence and harmful practices by 2030.\u00a0\nIn his appeal for a global ceasefire amid the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this week, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres emphasized that women and children are among the most vulnerable in times of war and face the highest risk of suffering devastating losses from the pandemic.\u00a0\nUNFPA has appealed to donors to fund its response plan, which targets countries with weak public health systems including countries in fragile and humanitarian situations.\u00a0 It is provisionally projecting that it will need $187.5 million.\u00a0\nEfforts will focus on bolstering health systems, procuring and delivering essential supplies to protect health workers, ensuring access to reproductive health and gender-based violence services, and promoting risk communication and community engagement.\u00a0\nInvisible impacts of COVID-19\u00a0\nAs communities around the globe grapple with the most immediate effects of the pandemic, overwhelmed healthcare systems and populations in quarantine can also suffer a ripple of additional impacts.\u00a0\n\u201cNow is a time for solidarity, resolve and selflessness.\u00a0 We must not forget that there are people we may not immediately see, who are at great risk as a result of the consequences of the crisis,\u201d said Dr. Kanem.\u00a0\nThose can include pregnant women who require antenatal care but are unsure whether it is safe to go to the clinic, as well as women in abusive relationships trapped at home for the foreseeable future and fearing for their safety.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCoronavirus Portal & News Updates\nReaders can find information and guidance on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from the UN, World Health Organization and UN agencies here. For daily news updates from UN News, click here.\nDr. Kanem also pointed to tens of millions of people living in refugee camps \u2013 for whom \u201csocial distancing\u201d practices are not an option \u2013 and older people around the globe who remain isolated and starved of social interaction as they avoid infection.\u00a0\u00a0\nMeeting \u2018intimate, yet essential\u2019 needs\u00a0\nUNFPA is working to support affected health systems, in particular by distributing material support to protect health workers and midwives.\u00a0\nIn China, Iran and the Philippines, it has distributed essential hygiene and other items to the most vulnerable and personal protective equipment to health workers.\u00a0 In the Republic of Moldova, it has launched an online dashboard which disaggregates the country\u2019s current caseload by location, sex, age and pregnancy status.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, Dr. Kanem stressed that more work is needed to ensure that the most intimate \u2013 yet essential \u2013 needs of women and girls are met as the world continues to battle COVID-19 in the months ahead.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThis global scourge requires a global response,\u201d she said, urging the international community to stand up for the dignity and health of women as part of its efforts.\u00a0\nFor more information on UNFPA\u2019s response to COVID-19, please visit www.UNFPA.org.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoronavirusCOVID-19sexual and reproductive health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              LISTEN TO UN RADIO\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nConflict, climate crisis, threaten fragile gains to advance women and children\u2019s health\n\n\nIraq: Top UN official calls on political leaders to confront COVID-19 pandemic and unite\n\n\nHuman rights must be maintained in beating back the COVID-19 pandemic, \u2018without exception\u2019 \u2013 UN experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              News Tracker: Past Stories on This Issue\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nLife-saving vaccinations must not \u2018fall victim\u2019 to COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 UNICEF chief26 March 2020\nHealthAround the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is overstretching health services, medical goods are in short supply, and transport disruptions have left supply chains facing \u201chistoric strain\u201d, according to the head of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF.\n\n\n\nUN\u00a0Population Fund\u00a0sounds alarm over\u00a0dire situation facing women and girls in Syria, as 10th year of war begins16 March 2020\nWomenThe UN sexual and reproductive health agency UNFPA, is expressing\u00a0increasing concern about the women and girls trapped in\u00a0Syria\u2019s dire and escalating\u00a0humanitarian\u00a0crisis,\u00a0especially in the north-west, where hostilities have caused mass displacement, human suffering and damage to civilian facilities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
