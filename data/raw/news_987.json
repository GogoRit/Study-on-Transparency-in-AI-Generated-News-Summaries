The providers argued that failing to do so would \u201cderail indefinitely the timely resolution of the merits of the case\u201d and \u201ccompound the ongoing harm to pregnant Texans under\u201d the law, which has been in effect since Sept. 1, but a majority of the court turned aside their plea without comment. Three justices \u2013 Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 indicated that they would have granted the providers\u2019 request.\nThe law at the center of the case, S.B. 8, prohibits almost all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, and it relies on private citizens to enforce the ban through lawsuits against anyone suspected of performing or aiding an abortion. On Dec. 10, the Supreme Court ruled that the providers\u2019 constitutional challenge to the law can go forward against a group of state medical licensing officials, although not against the state-court judges and clerks whom the providers had also named as defendants in their challenge. The justices also left S.B. 8 in place while the case continues in the lower courts, even though it conflicts with current Supreme Court precedent establishing a constitutional right to an abortion up until the point at which the fetus can survive outside the womb.\nOn Dec. 13, the providers asked the justices to formally issue their judgment and send the case back to U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, who in October put the law on hold in a short-lived decision that was quickly overruled by the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. On Dec. 16, the Supreme Court rejected the providers\u2019 plea to send the case back to Pitman, instead returning the dispute to the 5th Circuit.\nThe state licensing officials then asked the 5th Circuit to seek a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court on whether the officials have any power to enforce S.B. 8. In the alternative, they asked the 5th Circuit to set a briefing schedule for what they characterized as the remaining issues in the case \u2013 for example, whether the providers have a right to sue the licensing officials. On Dec. 27, a divided three-judge panel issued an order scheduling oral argument on the officials\u2019 request for Jan. 7.\nTelling the justices that Texas officials \u201care not entitled to a second bite at the apple,\u201d the providers came back to the Supreme Court on Jan. 3, again asking the justices to intervene and order the court of appeals to return the case to Judge Pitman. When the Supreme Court grants review before the court of appeals weighs in, as it did in this case, the providers contended, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision effectively takes the place of the lower court\u2019s ruling. And here, the providers reasoned, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the providers\u2019 case against the licensing officials could move forward, so there is nothing left for the 5th Circuit to do but send the case back to the district court.\nThe providers stressed the need for the Supreme Court to step in because of the \u201cextraordinary, urgent circumstances of this case.\u201d \u201cFor more than four months,\u201d they emphasized, \u201cthousands of Texans have been unable to exercise their federal constitutional right to terminate their pregnancy.\u201d Those who can afford to do so are traveling to other states, they noted, causing backlogs at clinics there, while others must continue \u201cpregnancy and childbirth against their will.\u201d They urged the justices to fast-track their request, suggesting that the Texas officials be required to file their opposition \u2013 which would otherwise be due on Feb. 3 \u2013 in just two days.\u00a0\nThe justices did not direct the Texas officials to move quickly, and the 5th Circuit heard oral argument as scheduled on Jan. 7. Earlier this week, the 5th Circuit granted the state officials\u2019 request to seek a ruling from the state supreme court on the scope of the power given to them by state law. Judge Stephen Higginson dissented from the court\u2019s order, complaining that the court of appeals was \u201conly causing further delay, indeed delay without specified end.\u201d \u00a0\nIn a one-sentence order on Thursday afternoon, the justices turned down the providers\u2019 request, ensuring that the litigation will remain at the Texas Supreme Court and not return to the federal district court for the foreseeable future. Breyer penned a one-page dissent, joined by both Sotomayor and Kagan, in which he explained that he would grant the providers\u2019 request because the 5th Circuit had \u201cignored\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in its Dec. 10 opinion. \u201cAs a result,\u201d Breyer noted, \u201can unconstitutional 6-week abortion ban remains in effect in Texas \u2014 as it has for over four months.\u201d\nThe main dissent, however, came from Sotomayor. In a seven-page opinion joined by both Breyer and Kagan, Sotomayor criticized the 5th Circuit\u2019s decision to seek a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court as a \u201ctransparent effort\u201d to stave off review of the merits of the providers\u2019 challenge. Indeed, she observed, one of the judges who heard oral argument in the case suggested that the court of appeals could \u201cjust sit on this until the end of June,\u201d when the Supreme Court could issue a decision (in the term\u2019s other high-profile abortion case) overruling its landmark rulings in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. By rejecting the providers\u2019 request to return the case immediately, Sotomayor lamented, the Supreme Court \u201caccepts yet another dilatory tactic by Texas.\u201d Therefore, she continued, the federal district court \u201cwill remain powerless to address S.B. 8\u2019s unconstitutional chill on abortion care, likely for months to come.\u201d Although her colleagues in the majority \u201cmay look the other way,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI cannot.\u201d\nThis article was originally published at Howe on the Court.\n\n\n\n\nPosted in Merits Cases, Cases in the Pipeline\n\n\nCases: Whole Woman\u2019s Health v.
