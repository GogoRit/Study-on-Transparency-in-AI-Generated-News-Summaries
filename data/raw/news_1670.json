Wade, half of all states \u2013 26 in total \u2013 have implemented new abortion restrictions or all-out bans.\n    \n\n            In nearly all 26 states, there are lower minimum wages, unionization levels, access to Medicaid and unemployment benefits, as well as higher rates of incarceration than states with more lenient abortion policies, according to new research by the Economic Policy Institute.\n    \n\n            \u201cThese economic policies all compound on each other. And you add to that an abortion ban, it just compounds this financial stress, this economic insecurity,\u201d said Asha Banerjee, an economic analyst with the institute and the author of the report.\n    \n\n            Last year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made a similar argument to the Financial Oversight Council.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades,\u201d Yellen told lawmakers in May. \n    \n\n            The lack of abortion access has the greatest economic impact on women of color, especially those already in dire financial conditions, according to Banerjee. \n    \n\n            \u201cIn many of these states, especially the states which have banned abortion, many of the women who are facing economic challenges already are also women of color,\u201d she said.\n    \n\n            Raising the minimum wage is a powerful tool that has been known to have significant impact on closing racial income gaps. But nearly two-thirds of abortion restrictive states have a $7.25 minimum wage, the lowest legal hourly wage for most workers in the United States.\n    \n\n            The average minimum wage across the 26 states is $8.17, lower than the average $11.92 for states with no restrictions. (Many of those states also have a higher cost of living, however.) \n    \n\n            \u201cIf the person denied an abortion is also working a minimum wage job, the negative economic effect is compounded,\u201d the report states.\n    \n\n    Access to healthcare, unemployment insurance\n\n\n            Many of those low-wage jobs also do not offer benefits like health care, which is why access to Medicaid is critical.\n    \n\n            \u201cMedicaid is a lifeline for low-income families and low-income women when jobs might not offer adequate healthcare. Medicaid in the immediate postpartum period is especially important,\u201d said Banerjee.\n    \n\n            Just 12 states have not expanded Medicaid benefits since the 2010 Obamacare law, and all of them have restrictive abortion policies. \n    \n\n            However, some states with total abortion bans, with few exceptions, have expanded Medicaid, including Missouri. And in five other abortion restrictive states (Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota later this year) residents voted to expand the benefit. \n    \n\n            Access to unemployment insurance is another key indicator of a state\u2019s commitment to economic support for residents. Forty-two percent of residents have access to unemployment benefits in states that have abortion protections. Compare that to 30% in states with abortion restrictions. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists protest outside the Indiana Statehouse during a special session debating on banning abortion in Indianapolis, Indiana, July 25, 2022. In September, a state judge blocked an Indiana law banning abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions from being enforced.\n\nCheney Orr/Reuters/FILE\n\n\n\n            Even if unemployment is accessible, the amount differs from state to state. For example, in Mississippi, a state with a total abortion ban with limited exceptions, weekly unemployment checks average $217. Meanwhile in Massachusetts, which has a more protective 24-week abortion ban \u2013 checks average $556 weekly. \n    \n\n            \u201cWhen you have unemployment insurance it helps create financial stability. These states which have abortion bans also have really terrible unemployment insurance systems with really low benefits which do not help one support oneself,\u201d said Banerjee.\n    \n\n            Although women make up a smaller percentage of those incarcerated than men, it is the economic category with the greatest difference between abortion protected and abortion-restricted states. The rate of incarceration in states with restrictive or total bans on abortion is more than one and a half times higher than the rate of incarceration for states with abortion protections.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s very much a racial justice issue because Black and Hispanic women are very disproportionately incarcerated. And that has huge economic impacts on future earnings and the ability to get a job,\u201d said Banerjee.\n    \n\n            In some states with abortion restrictions and higher rates of incarceration \u2013 legislation has suggested also criminalizing women, doctors or anyone aiding a woman in seeking an abortion. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe incarceration argument is especially important because in these states where abortion bans have come into play, there\u2019s a huge criminalization aspect,\u201d said Banerjee.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN Business Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nHear Melinda French Gates\u2019 one piece of advice for women\n1:21\n\n\n                    Mar 19, 2024\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Lemon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\u2018You are upsetting me\u2019: See Elon Musk react to Don Lemon\u2019s question before cutting ties with him\n2:27\n\n\n                    Mar 18, 2024\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn General/CNN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nAI will \u2018destroy employment in some areas,\u2019 top US economist says.
