Today, the United States is bordering on a reality where abortion is inaccessible, if not illegal, especially in Republican-controlled states such as Arkansas. This year, a federal court ruled that a variety of first-of-their-kind abortion regulations can be implemented in Arkansas. This decision will push those who seek abortion-care into dark situations.Beginning this August, doctors in Arkansas are prohibited from performing dilation and evacuation abortions on patients, and consequences for not complying include up to six years in prison. Doctors will also be required to notify local law enforcement when patients under the age of 17 seek an abortion and will be forced to involve family members of the patient in deciding how to dispose of fetal tissue remains.As dangerous as such abortion restrictions may be, they are not unprecedented in history. Criminalizing abortion has real, material consequences for patients seeking abortion-care. The recently imposed abortion restrictions in Arkansas mirror harmful anti-choice policies from the pre-Roe era.When studying abortion policies, we must expand the definition of \u201cpunishment\u201d to obtain a thorough understanding of punitive state measures. According to Leslie Reagan, a professor of history at the University of Illinois, in the late 1800s, the penalties for illegal abortions were \u201chumiliating interrogations about sexual matters by male officials.\u201d\u00a0 These interrogations reinforced traditional gender norms: that men and women should be married and women should carry children. Reagan states that \u201cstate officials focused special attention on unwed women and their partners,\u201d pressuring single women to marry the man with whom they had conceived. The similarities between these interrogations and the new Arkansas laws are uncanny, as doctors must involve the patients\u2019 family in deciding how to dispose of tissue remains. Moreover, the Arkansas law also demands conformity to traditional gender norms. Single women may be forced to include their sexual partner in this decision, even in situations where they wish to keep their abortion private.Furthermore, between 1867 and 1940, doctors who treated women who seemed to have had abortions were required to report their findings to the police. The same element of mandating that medical professions must report information to the police is mirrored in Arkansas\u2019 abortion restrictions: doctors are required to notify law enforcement when a patient under the age of 17 seeks abortion-care.The history surrounding anti-choice laws should serve as a warning for policymakers. As the anti-choice movement gains momentum, lawmakers can expect to feel more pressure to ban abortion and punish those who seek the procedure. But people do not stop having abortions just because they cannot have them legally. Instead, they stop having safe abortions. My home country of Romania serves as a case study on this matter. There, more than 9,000 women died between 1965 and 1989 from illegal abortions.Anti-choice policies, both today and in the past, harm patients seeking abortions. History should serve as a cautionary tale when it comes to the damage anti-choice policies inflict on our most vulnerable communities. It is time for anti-choice policymakers to ask themselves: Is the policy at hand really \u201cpro-life\u201d if it harms many of the constituents they vowed to protect?Carla Ramazan is\u00a0a senior studying political science and was named Nevada's 2020 Truman Scholar for her commitment to reproductive justice..Have your say: How to submit an opinion column or letter to the editor\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024"
