The conference comes ahead of this fall\u2019s key parliamentary elections where the party, which backs President Vladimir Putin, seeks to maintain its majority in the State Duma.\u00a0 \n\n\nnews\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPutin Proposes Closing Gay Marriage Loophole \u2013 Vedomosti\t\t\t\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording to Kommersant, lawmakers and religious figures debated measures including expanding support for large families in addition to deriding atheism, feminism and in vitro fertilization.\nUnited Russia member Vladimir Krupennikov, in addition to banning the propaganda of bisexuality and polyamory that \u201ccorrupt our youth,\u201d offered a ban on the propaganda of abortion, according to Kommersant.\u00a0Russia, with one of the world\u2019s highest abortion rates, has one of the world\u2019s most liberal abortion laws despite campaigns by conservative lawmakers and the Russian Orthodox Church to end state-funded procedures.\nThe state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported that the proposal also included banning propaganda of sex changes and transgenderism.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Krupennikov\u2019s proposal to ban the propaganda of bisexuality and polyamory had legislative prospects, but it reflected an increasingly conservative turn within Russia\u2019s parliament.\nThe proposal comes nearly a decade after Russia banned \u201cgay propaganda,\u201d a controversial law that critics say has been used to silence activists and shut down gay pride events.\nA majority of Russians voted last summer in favor of constitutional changes which, in addition to allowing Putin to extend his rule, added language defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman to the Constitution.\nPyotr Tolstoy, the deputy speaker of Russia\u2019s lower-house State Duma, said at the United Russia conference that without state measures Russia\u2019s population is expected to decline by 30 million over the next decade.\n\u201cEveryone in Russia more or less supports the moral values that our armchair liberals like to scoff at. These are families, but today\u2019s large family in Russia is still a poor family,\u201d Tolstoy said. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more about:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tLGBT\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,  \n\tUnited Russia\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,  \n\tState Duma\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 we have a small favor to ask.\nAs you may have heard, The Moscow Times, an independent news source for over 30 years, has been unjustly branded as a \"foreign agent\" by the Russian government.
