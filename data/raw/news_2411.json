West, who has never voted, revealed his plans for running under the \u201cBirthday Party\u201d with running mate Michelle Tidball, a Wyoming preacher, and a White House organizational model based off the fictional country Wakanda from Black Panther. His campaign slogan is simply \u201cYes!\u201d It\u2019s like a Twitter reply guy came to power. \u201cA lot of Africans do not like the movie [Black Panther] and representation of themselves in \u2026Wakanda,\u201d he explained his plans for the presidency. \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna use the framework of Wakanda right now because it\u2019s the best explanation of what our design group is going to feel like in the White House \u2026 That is a positive idea: You got Kanye West, one of the most powerful humans \u2014 I\u2019m not saying\u00a0the\u00a0most because you got a lot of alien-level superpowers and it\u2019s only collectively that we can set it free. Let\u2019s get back to Wakanda \u2026 like in the movie in Wakanda when the king went to visit that lead scientist to have the shoes wrap around her shoes. Just the amount of innovation that can happen, the amount of innovation in medicine \u2014 like Big Pharma \u2014 we are going to work, innovate, together.\u201d\nHe says he prefers creating \u201cdesigns\u201d over \u201cpolicy\u201d and has a lot of opinions on what to change. He wants prayer in schools: \u201cReinstate in God\u2019s state, in God\u2019s country, the fear and love of God in all schools and organizations and you chill the fear and love of everything else, so that was a plan by the Devil to have our kids committing suicide at an all-time high by removing God to have murders in Chicago at an all-time high because the human beings working for the Devil removed God and prayer from the schools.\u201d He hasn\u2019t \u201cdone enough research\u201d on taxes, but he\u2019ll find the \u201cstrongest experts that serve God and come back.\u201d Same for foreign policy, although he \u201cpromises\u201d that the NBA will go international, including China. West says he\u2019s anti-abortion, vaccine-\u201ccautious,\u201d despite claiming he had COVID-19 in February, and anti\u2013police brutality. And while he\u2019s officially no longer a MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporter, he still confers with Jared Kushner, appreciates \u201cthe saxophones in the lobby\u201d of Trump hotels, and has more criticism for Joe Biden. \u201cLet\u2019s see if the appointing is at 2020 or if it\u2019s 2024 \u2014 because God appoints the president,\u201d he \u2026 explains? \u201cIf I win in 2020 then it was God\u2019s appointment. If I win in 2024 then that was God\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\nSources\n\n\n\n            forbes\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Kanye West Announces 2020 Presidential Run\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Kanye West Teases New Song Off \u2018Forthcoming Album,\u2019 If Those Words Mean Anything\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\nkanye west\n\n\npolitics\n\n\nmusic\n\n\nrap\n\n\npolitics?\n\n\ncelebrity\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow \n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nKanye West Wants to Run the White House Like Wakanda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Things you buy through our links may earn\u00a0Vox Media\u00a0a commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Viewed Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nCinematrix No. 17: March 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiet on Set Shows the Darkest Side of Kids TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever She Is, Kate Middleton Isn\u2019t on Our Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKing Charles III Isn\u2019t Dead Yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Wish Is a Crypto-Fascist, AI-Generated Harbinger of Doom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiet on Set Shows the Darkest Side of Kids TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Wish Is a Crypto-Fascist, AI-Generated Harbinger of Doom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherever She Is, Kate Middleton Isn\u2019t on Our Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinematrix No. 17: March 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscar Speech Inspires Controversy, Misquoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe city politic\n\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\nThe Eric Adams Smash-and-Grab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njd vance\n\nJ.D.
