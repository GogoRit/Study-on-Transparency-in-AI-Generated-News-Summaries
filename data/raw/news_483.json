McCoy/Getty Images\n\n\n\nSitting at a conference table with a contingent of colleagues, almost all of them unmasked, state Rep. Jim Olsen laid out a bill that would end abortion in Oklahoma.\nUnder Senate Bill 612, anyone who provided or \u201cattempted\u201d to provide an abortion could be charged with a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.\nBut, state Rep. Denise Brewer asked, wasn\u2019t the legislation unconstitutional? Wouldn\u2019t it be a \u201cwaste of time and money\u201d to pass the bill and then try to defend it in court?\nOlsen falsely claimed that the bill would be constitutional. And regardless, he added, it was the moral thing to do. He offered a factually inaccurate and troubling analogy: The British lawmaker William Wilberforce dedicated his life to abolishing slavery but died before he could see it happen. (Wilberforce actually died after passage of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.) After 35 years of trying to abolish slavery, Olsen said, Wilberforce \u201cdied an apparent failure,\u201d but that didn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t have dedicated his life to the cause. \u201cAnd this is a cause of even greater import,\u201d Olsen said of banning abortion, \u201cbecause it deals with innocent unborn life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft/Top: Oklahoma Rep.

Ajay Pittman on the House floor on May 17, 2019, in Oklahoma City.\nPhotos: Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\n\nRep. Ajay Pittman, one of just eight members of the state\u2019s Legislative Black Caucus, followed up: \u201cYou\u2019re saying that saving the \u2026 life of an unborn child is more important than saving the lives of slaves?\u201d\n\u201cNone of us would like to be killed,\u201d Olsen replied. \u201cIf I had my choice, I guess I\u2019d be a slave; at least a slave has his life.\u201d\nPittman subsequently left the room. The bill sailed out of committee on an 8-1 vote.\nIn a statement posted to her website, Pittman blasted Olsen for his remarks. \u201cIn times like these where we see our nation on the cusp of reckoning social and racial injustices, we still endure implicit bias from our colleagues who are insensitive to what is said about the hurtful and ugly past of this country\u2019s treatment of African Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue as policy makers to chip away at the rights of women to choose proper healthcare for themselves \u2026 and now we are hearing our colleagues compare these healthcare issues to slavery, which also limited the rights of Black women by not allowing them to have a choice not to have children by their slave masters.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlsen\u2019s bill is just one among hundreds filed in legislatures across the country that seek to severely curtail, if not simply ban, abortion. 2021 has already seen 532 bills restricting abortion filed in 44 states, according to Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute. Of those measures, 22 have been enacted in six states.\nEmboldened by a newly conservative U.S. Supreme Court, many states have dropped all pretense that abortion restrictions are needed to ensure the health and safety of patients, said Jessica Arons, senior advocacy and policy counsel for reproductive freedom at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThey\u2019re just throwing everything at the wall to see what will stick,\u201d she said, crafting extreme measures designed to wind up in court and potentially before SCOTUS. In March, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said as much after signing into law a near total ban on abortion. \u201cI signed it because it is a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN. \u201cThat is the intent of it.\u201d To date, each of these extreme laws has been blocked by the courts.\nBut while there are plenty of straightforward bans, like the one in Arkansas and Olsen\u2019s SB 612, there is also a crop of more \u201csinister\u201d approaches, as Arons put it. Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for state policy and advocacy with the Center for Reproductive Rights, described these approaches as employing procedural \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d to try to ban abortion without explicitly taking aim at Roe. \u201cWhat we see are opponents of abortion rights \u2026 trying to sneak around the Constitution to pass their rules.\u201d\nProcedural Tricks\nAmong those employing the burgeoning smoke-and-mirrors approach are lawmakers in Texas. On its face, state Sen. Bryan Hughes\u2019s Senate Bill 8 looks a lot like bills passed in 11 states that ban abortion altogether or after about six weeks\u2019 gestation, which is long before most people know they\u2019re pregnant. Notably, each of those measures has been blocked by the courts. With that in mind, Hughes has taken a different tack: Instead of making the ban enforceable by a government actor \u2014 say, the state health department or the attorney general \u2014 SB 8 allows literally anyone to take matters into their own hands by filing a civil suit in state court against any doctor they believe may have violated the law. It also allows individuals to file suit against anyone who \u201caids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion,\u201d which could make any number of people vulnerable, including friends or relatives who lend someone money to pay for an abortion or drive a patient to a clinic.\n\u201cSenate Bill 8 is crafted to lead to judicial victories,\u201d John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, said during a committee hearing on the bill. \u201cThis bill is written to succeed where 11 other states have failed.\u201d\nThe goal is to make it impossible for abortion providers to sue the state to block the law from taking effect, what\u2019s known as a pre-enforcement challenge. If the state isn\u2019t responsible for enforcement, the thinking goes, then providers have no way to mount that kind of challenge to an otherwise unconstitutional ban on pre-viability abortion.\nThe bill would also bar providers from collecting attorneys\u2019 fees when they win in court \u2014 a move that imposes an extra burden on doctors, while further incentivizing individuals to sue them. Indeed, Texas and a number of other states have had to pay out millions in attorneys\u2019 fees when their abortion restrictions are blocked in court.\n\u201cThis bill tries to use tricky procedural moves to undermine years of Supreme Court precedent in an attempt to deny abortion to Texans,\u201d said Julie McClain Downey, senior director of advocacy communications for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\nThe idea for this strategy has its roots in a Louisiana case from the 1990s known as Okpalobi v. Foster, said Smith. There, lawmakers passed a bill that said patients could sue abortion providers for \u201cany damage\u201d caused by an abortion. Represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, the providers sued the governor and attorney general, arguing that the law would have a chilling effect that would amount to an undue burden on people seeking access to abortion. The district court agreed, blocking the law, and a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. But after revisiting the case, the full bench of the 5th Circuit concluded that while the law might be unconstitutional, because it had codified a means for private legal action, the providers couldn\u2019t sue the state to block it from taking effect. (The law is still on the books in Louisiana.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s deputizing anyone to harass a provider with no basis.\u201d\n\u201cTexas has hanged its hat on that precedent,\u201d Smith said. But it\u2019s not clear it will actually work. For one thing, because of the way the civil legal system is structured, the person filing suit has to have suffered actual harm. SB 8, meanwhile, would allow anyone to sue based on mere speculation that a doctor had violated the ban. \u201cIt\u2019s deputizing anyone to harass a provider with no basis,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to dress up this unconstitutional bill as something that\u2019s unassailable, but we know that\u2019s not the case. If this becomes enacted, abortion providers in Texas are not going to allow that to go unchallenged.\u201d\nIn Tennessee, where a number of abortion restrictions have been blocked by the courts, including a six-week ban, lawmakers are now considering a measure that would allow a person to prevent another\u2019s access to abortion by claiming paternity. Notably, the law would not require the person bringing suit to provide any DNA evidence to back up their claim. \u201cThe bill would allow someone to petition for an injunction to stop a woman from seeking medical care without providing scientific testing results proving that they are the biological father of the embryo or fetus,\u201d ACLU of Tennessee Legal Director Thomas H. Castelli wrote in a statement to The Intercept. \u201cThis is one of its many, many problems.\u201d\nOklahoma tried, and failed, to pass a similar measure in 2017, which would have required a pregnant person to get the approval of their partner before being able to access abortion. Such notification measures have long been deemed unconstitutional.\n\n\nTennessee Sen. Mark Pody, R-Lebanon, talks with people attending a state Senate hearing to discuss a fetal heartbeat abortion ban on Aug. 12, 2019, in Nashville, Tenn.\nPhoto: Mark Humphrey/AP\nNonetheless, Republican state Sen. Mark Pody told The Tennessean that he believes \u201ca father should have a right to say what\u2019s gonna be happening to that child.\u201d And if \u201csomebody is going to kill that child, he should be able to say, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want that child to be killed.\u2019\u201d\nReproductive rights advocates in Tennessee have decried the measure. \u201cThis unconstitutional legislation demonstrates the condescending mindset underlying this bill: that men should control women\u2019s bodies,\u201d Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the ACLU of Tennessee, told the newspaper. \u201cWomen are not chattel and this bill needs to be stopped in its tracks.\u201d\nBack in Oklahoma, Olsen is carrying another anti-abortion bill that also tries to sneak around its obvious constitutional defects. House Bill 1102 would amend state statute governing medical practice to define providing abortion as \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d punishable by license revocation.\nDuring a recent discussion of the bill on the House floor, Olsen variously defended the measure as perfectly legal (states have long had the freedom to control medical licensure, he said); as a vehicle to challenge Roe v. Wade (\u201cIt may end up going all the way there\u201d); and as a moral duty. He stated repeatedly that banning abortion was necessary to ensure equal rights. \u201cThat mother has a right to life and so also that baby has a right to life. So in the whole question, we have to factor in the mother and also we have to, on an equal basis, factor in the life of the baby as equally valuable,\u201d he said.\nState Rep. Meloyde Blancett later followed up: Did Olsen think that women who chose abortion were criminals?\n\u201cThose that do wrong, men or women who break the law of God, will be accountable to God. Hopefully we would have those major items in statute,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman who consents to the killing of her unborn child without a significant threat to her life, she is doing wrong, and she\u2019ll one day answer to God for it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe that you\u2019re representing the word of God on the floor today with your bill and your pronouncements?\u201d Blancett asked.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Olsen replied.\nThe bill passed 81-18 and is now pending in the Oklahoma Senate.\n\n\nAnti-abortion\u00a0activists, left, face abortion rights advocates, right, during a rally at the Supreme Court on March 2, 2016.\nPhoto: Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images\nPulling Back the Curtain\nDespite the different approaches taken by lawmakers across the country, these bills have one thing in common, advocates for reproductive rights say: They\u2019re unconstitutional. Take Olsen\u2019s bill to deem abortion unprofessional conduct. \u201cBy restricting doctors from providing abortion under the threat of license revocation \u2026 this bill is banning the provision of abortion altogether,\u201d said Nimra Chowdhry, state legislative counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cThis bill is a ban just like any other abortion ban.\u201d\nAnd there are a lot of them this year, in part because legislative operations mostly ground to a halt in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated (though that didn\u2019t stop a number of states from trying to exploit the public health crisis to bar access to abortion care). Even as the pandemic and its fallout continue, lawmakers have filed roughly 100 more bills this year than they did in 2019. In fact, the number of bills filed in 2021 is the highest since 2011, which saw 610 abortion restrictions filed.\nThe Guttmacher Institute\u2019s Nash says there are a lot of similarities between then and now: In 2010, a number of state legislatures lurched to the right, anti-abortion activists increased their on-the-ground organizing, and lawmakers who faced myriad problems related to the Great Recession turned to abortion to energize their base. In 2020, state legislatures did a rightward creep, and anti-abortion activists and lawmakers are jazzed by the prospect of sending an abortion law to the Supreme Court that the newly minted 6-3 conservative majority might seize on to revisit abortion rights.\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly confident that they have a court system that is staffed to interpret the laws in the way they want.\u201d\nThe energy animating this ambition has pulled back the curtain on the real intention behind these measures. For years, anti-abortion lawmakers pushed abortion restrictions under the guise of protecting the health and safety of patients. \u201cWe saw abortion opponents try to chip away access to abortion care by passing restrictions that weren\u2019t going to catch the attention of most people,\u201d said the ACLU\u2019s Arons. Things like mandating hospital admitting privileges, which may seem reasonable on its face until you realize that many abortion doctors can\u2019t get hospital privileges for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the safety of abortion. Moreover, in a medical emergency, a patient would go to a local emergency room, not to a hospital that could be hundreds of miles away in order to be admitted by their abortion provider.\nNow, however, \u201call of these states that are so hostile to abortion rights decided to go for broke and have become very blatant in their attempts to outlaw abortion,\u201d Arons said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a full-frontal ban on abortion or one of these more nefarious and surreptitious regulations, they\u2019re trying to push care out of reach. And they\u2019re clearly confident that they have a court system that is staffed to interpret the laws in the way they want.\u201d\nSmith, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, agrees. \u201cWe are really seeing people be much more explicit about what has always been their goal: prohibiting abortion entirely,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s important for everyone to know, that the bills may be more extreme now, but this was always their goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jordan Smith          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      jordan.smith@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @chronic_jordan                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The Fight for Reproductive Justice in a Post-Ginsburg World      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Supreme Court Upholds Abortion Rights but Leaves the Door Open to New Challenges      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Oklahoma Bill Would Force Doctors to Lie to Patients by Telling Them That Abortions Can Be Reversed      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Oklahoma Lawmakers Want Men to Approve All Abortions      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
