Whereas immigrants were once the main target, now it\u2019s LGBTQ people.by VICE StaffApril 30, 2021, 3:35pmShareTweetSnapA man wearing a historical military uniform salutes during a march marking Poland's independence day, organised by the far-right.

In cities around the country, members of far-right ultranationalist groups, backed by groups of hardcore football fans, appointed themselves as protectors of the churches, and proceeded to brutally confront the protesters.AdvertisementAt Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Holy Cross, women were hauled down the church steps by burly men, who hurled misogynistic insults as they did so. In the aftermath, Robert B\u0105kiewicz, the ultranationalist leader in the thick of the confrontation at the church, announced he was forming a vigilante \u201cNational Guard\u201d to repel the protesters, who he referred to as \u201cleftist barbarians.\u201d\u201cWe will defend every church, every district, every town, every village,\u201d he said. \u201cI can say that a sword of justice is hanging upon them, and if necessary, we will turn them into dust and destroy this revolution.\u201dYet despite a police warning that the far-right vigilantes were inflaming the situation, figures from the country\u2019s conservative ruling Law and Justice party publicly supported them.Law and Justice leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, considered Poland\u2019s most powerful politician, called on Catholics to mobilise and defend the churches, while one of his MPs, Tomasz Rzymkowski, commended the \u201cyoung nationalists\u201d who were defending the church, as well as \u201cthe whole of Latin civilisation, against the barbarians.\u201dWhile the clashes that rocked Poland in the wake of the abortion ruling were shocking, they weren\u2019t exactly new.\u00a0A demonstrator gestures during a pro-choice march in Warsaw this January.

Emboldened by the aggressively nationalist direction of the conservative government \u2013 which has sought to forcefully impose its traditionalist vision on Polish society \u2013 these men, drawn from neofascist ultranationalist movements and the football hooligan scene, have consistently acted as willing foot soldiers in their country\u2019s furious culture wars.\u00a0AdvertisementNews'There Is No Turning Back' \u2013 Polish Women Undeterred by Threat of Far-Right Violence Tim Hume, Nina Zabicka10.30.20Since coming to power in 2015, the right-wing populist Law and Justice government has proven itself unlike any previous Polish administration in the post-Communist era, rapidly remaking the country in its own image, in a way that critics say imperils the country\u2019s democratic order.It\u2019s stacked courts with loyalists, tightened its grip on the media, and systematically sought to roll back socially liberal values. Adopting a nationalist agenda as central to its populist platform, Law and Justice has demonised minorities, polarised society, and emboldened the far-right, allowing radical right-wing sentiment to creep from the margins into the mainstream.Far-right supporters take part in the independence march last year. Photo: WOJTEK RADWANSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesThese moves have attracted widespread criticism, both externally and domestically. State-appointed watchdog Adam Bodnar, Poland\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, says Law and Justice\u2019s tactics are jeopardising Poland\u2019s democracy, particularly in its empowering of the far-right.\u201cThis moment when the leader of the country is sharing the monopoly for violence with private organisations like [the] far-right is extremely dangerous to democracy,\u201d he told VICE World News, referring to Law and Justice\u2019s endorsement of the ultranationalist church \u201cdefenders\u201d amid the protests over abortion rights.\u201cIt is a little bit like playing with fire \u2026 you are opening some possibilities for them. You are giving them some positions in the whole structure of the state.\u201dAdvertisementSince 2015, Law and Justice has relied on a political M.O. of routinely scapegoating minority groups to whip up waves of support from its conservative base.It came into government in 2015, at the height of the European migration crisis, on the back of a wave of anti-migrant hysteria that resulted in an outpouring of Islamophobic sentiment \u2013 despite Poland being overwhelming homogenous, with a tiny Muslim population, and not being situated on main migration routes through Europe.READ: Poland\u2019s populist government let right-wing extremism explode into the mainstreamThen, seeking a new target, Law and Justice moved on to the LGBTQ community, with leading politicians in recent successive election campaigns painting gay rights as a dangerous, alien ideology that threatens the traditional, Catholic Polish family unit.\u00a0A man wearing a white supremacist mask and T-shirt takes part in an anti-LGBTQ demonstration in Krakow last summer. Photo: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe sustained and ugly onslaught came from the highest levels of the party, with Kaczy\u0144ski describing calls for greater LGBTQ rights as a \u201cgreat danger\u201d and \u201cessentially an attack on children.\u201d Other Law and Justice politicians tweeted that \u201cPoland is most beautiful without LGBT,\u201d or compared gay marriage to bestiality, while about 100 municipal councils \u2014 accounting for about a third of Poland\u2019s territory \u2013 adopted resolutions declaring themselves \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d.AdvertisementThe hate speech from those in power emboldened bigots, and unleashed a wave of public hostility that\u2019s left the LGBTQ community under attack, often physically so. At events like the 2019 Pride march in the city of Bialystok, marchers were set upon by a hostile far-right mob of hooligans, ultranationalists and Catholic hardliners who assaulted them with impunity.READ: Poland\u2019s ruling party is using homophobia to attract voters\u201cPeople got attacked. People got chased on the streets. People got beaten up, people got bricks thrown at them, or bottles with piss,\u201d said Ola Kaczorek, co-president of Love Does Not Exclude, a group that campaigns for marriage equality.A man holds a \"Women's Strike\" flag during a protest against Poland's near-total abortion ban. Photo: Omar Marques/Getty ImagesThen in October came the ruling from Poland\u2019s Constitutional Court that abortion in the case of severe foetal defects was unconstitutional. The decision, made by a court stacked with Law and Justice appointees, outlawed the most common of the few existing grounds for legal termination in a country that already had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. For critics, it represented the culmination of a systematic wave of attacks on women\u2019s rights by the ruling party.\u201cYou feel like you are in a war with your own government,\u201d Justyna Wydrzy\u0144ska, a board member of Abortion Without Borders, an initiative that helps Polish women access abortions, told VICE World News.AdvertisementNews\u2018We Are Governed By Morons': Poland's Leading Pro-Choice ActivistPawe\u0142 M\u0105czewski01.25.21Bodnar, Poland\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the abortion ban \u2013 which came into effect in January \u2013 represented the government paying a \u201cpolitical debt\u201d to the Catholic Church. \u201cWhen the Catholic Church has a strong stance on abortion, then the coin which is paid is a restriction on of access to abortion.\u201dAll of which has made the country\u2019s far-right fringe increasingly brazen, buoyed by the country\u2019s sharp lurch to the right under Law and Justice. One of the clearest illustrations of its growing confidence is the annual Independence March in Warsaw, held every November 11 on the anniversary of the restoration of Polish independence in 1918.A police officer faces a woman as she argues against a pro-life counter protest in Krakow last October. Photo: Omar Marques/Getty ImagesFor over a decade now, an association of far-right organisations \u2013 currently led by B\u0105kiewicz \u2013 has hijacked Poland\u2019s national day by organising a huge rally through the capital, which draws ordinary patriotic Poles alongside hooligan and neofascist groups from across the country and elsewhere in Europe.\u00a0READ: Poland\u2019s capital erupts as far-right take over streetsThe march, which has grown dramatically in scale in recent years, frequently descends into violence, with flare-wielding hooligans clashing with police. At last year\u2019s march, a flare was fired at an apartment that had women\u2019s rights and LGBTQ banners hanging from it, setting the building on fire.AdvertisementThe hateful messaging on display also underlines the many shared positions between the far-right and the government in various flashpoints in Poland\u2019s culture wars.Last year\u2019s march \u2013 organised under the theme \"Our civilisation, our rules\u201d \u2013 had a markedly homophobic tone, echoing the government\u2019s anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. The event was advertised with a poster depicting a knight driving his sword into a rainbow star, while marchers carried banners reading \u201cNormal family, strong Poland\u201d \u2013 a slogan used by the Polish right in opposition to LGBTQ rights.Years of facing a conservative Law and Justice juggernaut in power, and an emboldened far-right brutally enforcing its traditionalist vision of society on the streets, has left liberal and progressive Poles fearing that their country may be slipping away. For minorities, in particular, the sustained attacks on their community has taken a toll.Huge numbers of people gathered to protest the near-total abortion ban. This was the scene in Warsaw last October after the ban was announced. Photo: Omar Marques/Getty Images\u201cLGBT+ youth are growing up surrounded by this whole agenda, this whole ideology that says that there is something innately wrong with them,\u201d said Kaczorek of Love Does Not Exclude.READ: Poland\u2019s populist government has declared war on the LGBTQ communityThere are routine reminders of the daunting obstacles in seeking to challenge the increasingly authoritarian Law and Justice government. Earlier this month, Bodnar \u2013 who acted as one of the few independent watchdogs of the government \u2013 was ordered out of his post, by the same Law and Justice-captured court behind the abortion ruling in October. Human Rights Watch described the finding against Bodnar, which prompted street demonstrations and which NGOs say was legally flawed, as being made at the government\u2019s behest; his replacement is almost certain to be a Law and Justice appointee.A protester holds a Virgin Mary with a rainbow halo poster during a Pride parade in Plock, central Poland, in 2019.
