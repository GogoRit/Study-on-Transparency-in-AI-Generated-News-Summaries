Courtesy | Paula Skwarek\nMichigan residents are fighting for a dismemberment abortion ban act through citizen-initiated legislation, leading the way for other pro-life initiatives across the country.\n\u201cRight to Life of Michigan is the most prolific organization in the state\u2019s history with regard to this particular provision,\u201d said Genevieve Marnon, legislative director at Right to Life of Michigan. \u201cThis is our fifth citizens-initiated piece of legislation.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile Right to Life of Michigan advocates for limitations on abortion procedures, Democrats in the Michigan House of Representatives are proposing widespread abortion access. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joined members of the House Democratic Caucus on Oct. 29, 2019, to propose the Michigan Reproductive Health Act.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, at the national level, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for its first abortion case that includes Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the bench on March 4, and could potentially hear another case regarding a Michigan abortion law in the future.\nReproductive Health Act\nAccording to a statement released by the Michigan House Democrats, the RHA was proposed to \u201crepeal outdated and unconstitutional prohibitions on reproductive health care,\u201d referring to a 1931 law that makes abortion illegal in Michigan.\nThe RHA is a set of sweeping laws that would remove required parental notifications for minors, eliminate a required 24-hour waiting period after requesting an abortion, allow abortion clinics to avoid inspection, and get rid of mandatory screenings for abortion coercion.\u00a0\n\u201cIn Michigan, a pregnant person\u2019s options are limited by policy, and that makes it harder to give patients the best possible care,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Wallett, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, at an October 2019 press conference. \u201cPeople who make the decision to have an abortion should be able to access it without obstacles that do nothing to improve their care.\u201d\nMichigan is among nine states that have pre-Roe v. Wade abortion bans on the books. These could be enforced if Roe is overturned.\nMarnon said the group is leading pro-life initiatives in the state and across the country.\n\u201cWe have the best pro-life laws in the United States,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cAlabama and Georgia have nothing on us.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe 1973 Roe decision legalized abortion in all 50 states. Marnon, however, said Democrats are concerned that with an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, Roe may be at risk of being overturned.\u00a0\nIf the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe, the legality of abortion would be left to the individual states, establishing a legal path for states\u2019 pre-1973 abortion bans, like Michigan\u2019s, to take effect.\n\u201cPro-abortion activists know that Roe\u2019s days are numbered and that Roe was poorly decided and shouldn\u2019t stand,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they want to make Michigan a pro-abortion state.\u201d\nState Rep. Eric Leutheuser of the 58th district said he doesn\u2019t see the RHA gaining traction in the legislature.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a reaction to legislation being passed in other states.\u201d\nNew York, Virginia, and Illinois signed their own reproductive health acts into law last year. These states now have few restrictions and standards on abortions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a game of copycat,\u201d Leutheuser said. \u201cStates with Democratic governors and legislators are trying to show their pro-choice bona fide by introducing legislation like this.\u201d\nLeutheuser said there is no expectation that this bill will get hearings or move through the houses, as both have a pro-life majority.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic gesture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on anyone that it\u2019s an election year and could be used to do fundraising and shake the money tree for progressive candidates.\u201d\nDismemberment Abortion Ban Act\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile Whitmer helped propose the RHA, pro-life groups are advocating to get other legislation on the books that would prohibit the dismemberment abortion procedure.\u00a0\nVolunteers across Michigan collected more than 300,000 signatures from residents to ban dismemberment, a common method of performing late-term abortions. A dismemberment procedure is defined by the law as \u201cany instrument, device, or object to dismember a living fetus by disarticulating limbs or decapitating the head.\u201d\nThe signatures could lead to a bill that would add an additional clause to the 2011 partial-birth abortion ban law, which allowed for dismemberment abortions. The new clause would prohibit the use of dismemberment abortions, commonly performed during the second trimester.\u00a0\nWith the addition of the clause, an abortionist found guilty of performing this operation would wind up with a prison sentence of up to two years and a fine of $50,000.\nAs opposed to the traditional method of passing a bill through both houses and the governor\u2019s office, Michigan Right to Life is using citizen-initiated legislation to get around Whitmer\u2019s promised veto.\u00a0\n\u201cIf the legislature is not being responsive, citizens with wide grassroots support can have petition drives,\u201d Leutheuser said.\u00a0\nA minimum of 8% of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election must be collected during petition drives. If the signatures are deemed valid, two options are available. Either the bill can go to a public vote on the ballot, like Proposal 1 that legalized marijuana, or a bill can be sent to both houses and upon winning a simple majority, skip the governor and become law.\nRight to Life of Michigan has used the latter option with success four times previously, including to ban partial-birth abortions and take abortion out of insurance plans.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s what they call \u2018veto-proof,\u2019\u201d Leutheuser said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to veto it.\u201d\nBefore a petition drive begins, Right to Life of Michigan seeks to pass the bill through normal routes.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have always gone through the regular legislative routes first,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cIn this particular case, we did not get the veto, but we got the votes in both chambers, so we know we have the votes.\u201d\nBased on the 2018 election, the minimum signatures needed for this drive was 340,047. On Dec. 23, Right to Life of Michigan turned in 379,418 signatures to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.\u00a0\nThe bureau will decide in the next few weeks if the petition drive met the quota. If so, the legislature will have 40 days to vote on it again.\u00a0\n\u201cWe voted on it last term,\u201d Leutheuser said. \u201cIf we vote in the affirmative again, it becomes law.\u201d\nRight to Life of Michigan is anticipating challenges from Democrats over the bill.\u00a0\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood or the League of Women Voters will likely file a lawsuit that this is an unconstitutional law,\u201d Marnon said.\u00a0\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she will \u201cnever enforce\u201d this law if challenged by a judge. Marnon said this is \u201cnot their first rodeo\u201d and are prepared for Nessel\u2019s unwillingness.\u00a0\n\u201cWe put in intervener language,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cIt allows for members of the house or the senate to intervene on behalf of the state and defend this law, so we don\u2019t have to rely on this particular attorney general.\u201d\nMarnon noted it is likely a judge will deem this law unconstitutional because it is a pre-viability ban and current law restricts banning abortions before viability.\n\u201cThere are other ways to kill babies in the second trimester,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cThey will claim that it\u2019s an undue burden for women to have to go to the alternative routes of abortion.\u201d\nSince 1992, courts have used the undue burden standard as the test to evaluate whether state laws on abortion are constitutional. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote \u201can undue burden exists and therefore a provision of law is invalid if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\u201d\nIf a judge strikes the law down, an appeal will be sent to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s also likely that the sixth circuit will deem it to be unconstitutional, but we don\u2019t know that for sure,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cThey have not had a dismemberment ban come before the sixth circuit before.\u201d\nA dismemberment ban like Michigan\u2019s has been passed in 12 other states and was struck down in 10 of them. Mississippi and West Virginia didn\u2019t challenge the law because neither have an abortion clinic in the state that uses dismemberment methods.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cGiven that we have plenty of abortionists in the state that do it, I\u2019m pretty confident that it will be struck,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cAt that point, it will be appealed to the Supreme Court.\u201d\u00a0\nA Michigan Law Before the U.S. Supreme Court?\u00a0\nIn March, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear its first abortion related case with Kavanaugh on the bench. June Medical Services LLC v. Gee challenges a law that requires abortionists to obtain admitting privileges \u2014 the ability of a doctor to admit a patient to a local hospital \u2014\u00a0 before performing abortions.\nRight to Life of Michigan submitted an amicus curiae brief for this case urging the court to repeal Roe with it.\n\u201cThe Roe v. Wade decision went beyond the scope of their power, violated the process for amending the U.S. Constitution, and has undermined the legitimacy of our nation\u2019s judicial system,\u201d Right to Life of Michigan wrote in a January 2020 press release about the brief. \u201cThe Supreme Court has recognized that the government has an interest in protecting the life of unborn children, and the brief asks the Supreme Court to live up to their own standards.\u201d\nThe brief said that even if the court isn\u2019t ready to overturn Roe, June should stand independently because \u201cabortionists often have no relationship with local hospitals.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be the first test case with a majority conservative justices,\u201d Marnon said. \u201cThis will be Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s first at-bat.\u201d\nIf the court doesn\u2019t overturn Roe with June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, Right to Life of Michigan is prepared to bring forward its dismemberment case.\nThe pro-life group decided to back a dismemberment ban because it believes the ban is the most likely legislation to be reviewed by the nine justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0\nChris Gast is the director of communications at Right to Life of Michigan and said the case could lead to the reversal of Roe.\n\u201cThe last time we saw the court really expand the ability of states to impact the issue of abortion was when they allowed the partial-birth abortion to stand,\u201d Gast said. \u201cSince we have a partial-birth ban, why don\u2019t we just add the definition of a dismemberment abortion to it?\u201d\nThe potential case would ask the court to use the same logic they used in the 2007 Gonzales v. Carhart case that upheld partial-birth abortions to now remove dismemberment.\n\u201cThey can review Roe anytime, it\u2019s just when they\u2019re courageous enough to do the right thing,\u201d Gast said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nabortion, dismemberment ban, Governor Whitmer, Pro-life, Right to Life of Michigan\n\nPrevious PostQ&A with General SpieseNext PostNew campus club to focus on midwifery education\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\nRecent Posts\n\n\nTheater to host St. Patrick\u2019s Day bash\n\n\nUnderdogs throws weekly ladies\u2019 night with \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 cocktails\n\n\nQuincy schools test clear for water, air contaminants\n\n\nStudents host final statue golf tournament before construction on the quad begins\n\n\nOrchestra performs program of classical music, film scores\n\n\nPsi Chi brings animals from Humane Society to campus\n\n\nRadio students travel to New York for IBS awards\n\n\nA professor\u2019s opinion: \u2018Wheel of Fortune\u2019\n\n\nFinal CCA of the semester covers the American musical\n\n\nMilitary history students prepare for American Revolution trip\n\n\n\n\nTweets by HDaleCollegian\n\n\nADVERTISE WITH THE COLLEGIAN\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest advertising space in either the print Collegian, online, or both.\n\n* Required\n\nFirst and Last Name*\n\n\n\nBusiness/Organization*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\nPhone Number*\n\n\n\nAd Type*\n\n\u2014Please choose an option\u2014Full Page (Print)Half Page (Print)1/4 Page (Print)1/8 Page (Print)Business Card Size (Print)Other (Print)Banner (Online)Square (Online)Both Online and Print\n\nColor or Black & White*\n\n\u2014Please choose an option\u2014ColorBlack & White\n\nSecond Ad option / comments\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the email newsletter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsHome\nCity News\nSports\nCulture\nAbout The CollegianAbout The Collegian\nContact and Subscribe\nWrite a Letter to the Editor\nArchives\ne-edition\nAbout Hillsdale CollegeHillsdale Home\nSupport Hillsdale\nThe Hillsdale College Official Store\nDow Center\nThe Dow Journalism ProgramDow Journalism Program\nRadio Free Hillsdale\nRadio Free Hillsdale Hour\nWRFH Facilities\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAbout The Collegian\nContact and Subscribe\nWrite a Letter to the Editor\nArchives\ne-edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t\tCopyright @2023-24 Hillsdale Collegian\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.
