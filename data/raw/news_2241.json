Replying to Live Action, the rapper declared that \u201cno one cares, ratio.\u201d \u201cTens of millions of Americans DO CARE that 2,400 babies are being murdered every day,\u201d the pro-life group retorted.Hill retweeted a link to the article and maintained that \u201cThe \u2018pregnant fan\u2019 was a boy on my Instagram making a joke about him being pregnant u losers.\u201d Live Action President and founder Lila Rose told the rapper that the joke and his response to it were not funny: \u201cJokes about ordering women to have abortions and \u2018get rid\u2019 of their children are misogynistic and gross. Just say sorry and move on.\u201d\u201cRegardless of the intention, you encouraged the brutal slaughter of innocent children to your 6 million followers. It\u2019s disgusting.

Do better. pic.twitter.com/pBqbPpCLj5\u2014 Live Action (@LiveAction) December 17, 2020 While one of Hill\u2019s subsequent tweets illustrates a degree of frustration about the attention his \u201cget rid of it\u201d comment has received, he appears to have no regrets about making them. Retweeting a Breitbart article on the matter, the rapper used the phrase \u201cGet rid of it\u201d again, accompanied by stick figures and emojis depicting playfulness and embarrassment.This is not the first time that Hill has clashed with conservatives. In June, the rapper accused Fox News host Tucker Carlson of lying by \u201ctelling millions of people on national television that I was inciting riots.\u201dCarlson listed Hill as one of several celebrities that donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which was \u201cproviding bail to rioters\u201d and led to the release of violent offenders and even a child rapist. While the fund has raised over $3,475,000 only $210,000 has gone to pay people's bail.\u00a0The Fox News segment came as protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, engulfed cities across the U.S. Many of these protests often turned into violent riots, looting, and arson that destroyed 400 local businesses and is expected to cost over $500 million to rebuild.\u00a0Following the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the most liberal members of the court, TMZ caught up with Hill and asked him what he thought a replacement for Ginsburg, who would be appointed by President Donald Trump, \"could mean for his rights as a member of the LGBTQ community.\" \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d replied Hill, who is openly gay.\u201cIt\u2019s scary. We have to get out and vote,\u201d he added. When asked if he had a message for his followers and fans, Hill urged them to \u201cget out and vote and use your voice.\u201d He declined to comment, motioning that his lips were zipped, when the TMZ reporter inquired as to whether he had a message for Trump, who had yet to announce Amy Coney Barrett as his designated replacement for Ginsburg.Just last month, Hill got into an exchange with Angela Stanton King, a former Republican congressional candidate, who tweeted out her concerns with a promo image for his song \u201cHoliday.\u201d The image featured a picture of Hill about to make out with a clone of himself.\u201cSo this is what black culture is pushing to our youth now?\u201d King asked. \u201cSex with everything and everyone including yourself? Is lil nas x tonguing himself down?\u201dIn response to King\u2019s tweet, Hill told her to \u201cjust say ur turned on and go.\u201dWas this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
