She was 53.\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2018, the time she was assistant director for pro-life communications at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, McQuade was interviewed by various media and spoke at numerous events, offering views on palliative care, abortion and alternatives to physician-assisted suicide.\n\n\n\n \n\nDeirdre McQuade (CNS/Courtesy of McQuade Family via Catholic Herald)\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends recalled McQuade as someone whose strong faith helped her staunchly uphold the value of human dignity in her work.\n\"She was very serious about her faith and incorporating faith in life,\" said Dawn Eden Goldstein, an author and theologian, who met McQuade in 2007 and became close friends with her over the years.\nGoldstein recalled McQuade as an advocate for a consistent ethic of life in both her professional and personal life and said her values were reflected when she chose Sr. Thea Bowman, a candidate for sainthood who was the first African American member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, as her patron.\nYearslong friend Colin O'Brien described McQuade's rich sense of warmth, friendship and hospitality, which led to her \"really being there for other people.\"\n\"You'd be sitting there and talking with her and you felt like you were to only person in the room,\" O'Brien said. \"Deirdre's best friend was the person in front of her at the time she was with them.\"\nMcQuade was born Sept. 24, 1968, to P.J. and Genevieve McQuade. Her parents, members today of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception Parish in Fredericksburg, Virginia, recalled their daughter's deep faith that guided her life and led to positive outlook on life.\nGenevieve McQuade said her daughter's faith \"began to blossom\" during middle school when the family lived in Morris Plains, New Jersey, and she led morning prayer groups for fellow students and also became involved in peer-to-peer youth ministry.\n\n\n\"Dierdre led her life in the Spirit. She would watch for a wave to come along with the power of the Spirit and then jump on the wave like a surfboarder. She would go with the flow. A lot of her accomplishments look effortless. She dove in with both feet. She was really immersed in the spiritual end of life,\" P.J. McQuade said.\n\n\nThat wave took her into working with women in crisis pregnancies at Women's Care Center in Indiana after completing work in 1998 on a master's degree in philosophy and a master of divinity degree, both from the University of Notre Dame. She completed undergraduate studies at Pennsylvania's Bryn Mawr College in 1990.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDuring nearly five years at the women's center, McQuade worked with hundreds of women, providing pregnancy tests, counseling and supportive services. She also taught healthy relationship skills to hundreds of teenagers as well as homeless women.\nIn 1999, her experience led her to the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana, where she became director of pastoral research and outreach and the ecumenical office.\nIn 2003, she became national program director for Feminists for Life, overseeing an outreach program to college students, before taking short-term positions with an organization that worked with Christian professionals and then as a program analyst at the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women's Health.\nMcQuade started work at the U.S. bishops' conference in 2005, when she was given the responsibility of handling pro-life communications. The position allowed her to establish a reputation as a credible spokesperson and highly respected speaker at parishes and with advocacy programs.\nShe left the bishops' conference in 2018 to pursue her love of photography and establish her own company, Brightness of Water Productions, based in Hyattsville, a suburb of Washington.\nMcQuade was diagnosed with cancer in 2019.\nSurvivors include her parents and a sister, Pamela Jane.\nA funeral Mass will be celebrated May 3 at St. Jerome Church in Hyattsville.\nA GoFundMe page has been established to aid the family with medical expenses.\n[Contributing to this story was Kevin Schweers, executive editor of content at the Arlington Catholic Herald, newspaper of the Diocese of Arlington, Virginia.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMost Read Stories\n\n\n \n\n#1 New combative faith group to host 'Catholic prayer' for Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n \n\n#2 Attacking Pope Francis, anonymous cardinal seeks to curb the influence of his papacy\n \n\n#3 Here in the US, Catholicism is for sale\n \n\n#4 The Catholic Church needs married priests now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanRome biblical and Eastern institutes merged with Gregorian UniversityByCindy WoodenCatholic News Service\n \n\nNewsLife-threatening safety concerns keep Burkina Faso Catholics away from Sunday MassByTonny OnyuloOSV News\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanThe first outside legal analyses of Vatican's 'trial of the century' are in, and they're criticalByNicole WinfieldAssociated Press\n \n\nFrancis, the comic stripVaticanFrancis, the comic stripByPat Marrin\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR's Free NewslettersSelect any of the newsletters below, then enter your email address and click \"subscribe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per dayDaily Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updates: The latest news and feature articles\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Daily: (the latest articles, sent every morning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per weekWeekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Weekly: NCR staff talk music, television, books, movies and more\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Weekly: Environment editor Stephanie Clary dives into the week's climate change news\n\n\n\nMichael Sean Winters: The nexus between religion and politics\n\n\n\nNCR Book Club: Find your latest book to read\n\n\n\nScripture for Life: Reflections on the Sunday readings\n\n\n\nSunday Resources: Reflections on the readings sent two months ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x WeeklyBiweekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Francis Chronicles: Get to know the pope's pastoral side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Sections\n\n\nNCR Sections\n\n\nNews\n\n\nVatican\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSpirituality\n\n\nSunday Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Channels\n\n\nEarthBeat\n\n\nGlobal Sisters Report\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Menu\n\n\nWays to Give\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nYour NCR Legacy\n\n\nFriends & Tributes\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR\n\n\nRenew Subscription\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\nFree Newsletters\n\n\neNCR and Kindle Edition\n\n\nRequest a sample issue\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nHow to write for NCR\n\n\nLetters to Editor\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\n\nChange your address\n\n\nReprints\n\n\n\n\nAbout NCR\n\n\nMission & Values\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nStaff and Contributors\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nDonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Catholic Reporter\nFollow\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTikTok\n\n\nAdvertising Guidelines / \n  Terms of Use / \n  Privacy Policy / \n  Site Map\n/ Mailing Address: 115 E Armour Boulevard Kansas City, MO 64111 / Phone Number: +1-800-444-8910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
