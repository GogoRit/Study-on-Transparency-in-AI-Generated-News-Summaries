Many members were active supporters of the eugenics movement. It therefore may not surprise readers to see its publication reproduce a long-standing myth of American racism, tied to its obsession with Black sexuality \u2013 the myth of Black hyper-fertility.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4The Gambia votes to reverse landmark ban on female genital mutilationlist 2 of 4South Korea to China: Why is East Asia producing so few babies?list 3 of 4\u2018We are tired, angry and mad\u2019: 180,000 women march in Mexico Citylist 4 of 4Varadkar concedes defeat in Ireland\u2019s referendum on family, women\u2019s rolesend of list\nThey will be more surprised, however, to read similar sentiments from as eminent and thoughtful an African American scholar as sociologist WEB Du Bois, who wrote in the same issue of\u00a0Birth Control Review\u00a0\u201cthe mass of ignorant Negroes still breed carelessly and disastrously\u201d, advocating a politics of fertility mired with paternalism, and insisting upon respectability through \u201cproper birth control\u201d.\nDespite the racist fear of Black hyper-fertility,\u00a0reproduction rates for Black people declined\u00a0in the era of Jim Crow, a phenomenon that persists to this day, as\u00a0Professor Dorothy Roberts noted in her book\u00a0Killing the Black Body. While 12 percent of women of reproductive age having impaired fertility according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Black women are\u00a0two times more likely than their white counterparts to be infertile.\nWhile some health inequalities can be attributed to the effects of social inequality (itself deeply racist), the fertility gap is visible in the study\u00a0after\u00a0its authors adjusted for the subjects\u2019 social class, and risk factors like smoking. Compared with other health inequalities, like those surrounding infant mortality or the risk of death during childbirth \u2013 a subject about which Serena Williams wrote forcefully after her own difficult experience \u2013 infertility is not necessarily widely known about in the African American community. In a study of African American women in Atlanta, researchers found\u00a0limited knowledge\u00a0of the problem.\u00a0\nThe causes of infertility are sometimes unclear, and vary from person to person. They include: untreated chlamydia and gonorrhoea, STDs that cause pelvic inflammatory disease; nutritional deficiency; environmental and workplace hazards. The uterine disorder of\u00a0fibroids, from which Black women are significantly more likely to suffer, may contribute to infertility, yet not enough research has been done to provide a definitive link.\nLow fertility can sometimes be treated by assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF). The use of such treatments has increased dramatically in recent decades,\u00a0particularly in states which have mandated their inclusion as part of healthcare coverage.\u00a0Here too, however, there are disparities between Black women and other populations with respect to access and success rates. \nIn Chicago, where IVF treatment is covered by health insurance under Illinois law, Black people make up 32 percent of the population but only\u00a05.3 percent of people seeking IVF. Even when they have been able to access treatment and they have the same class background as white women,\u00a0live births for\u00a0African American women are lower than their white counterparts.\u00a0\nInfertility causes\u00a0unique psychological stresses and anxieties, as well as affecting relationships.\u00a0Professor Rosario Ceballo found\u00a0that African American women coping with infertility suffered disruptions to their sense of self and even to their gender identity. Ceballo found that these challenges were exacerbated by the widespread silence around African American infertility, and the predominance of the myth of fertility.\nThe statistics are clear but the root cause and potential solutions are not. The latter must surely begin with a proper accounting of the problem, and a widespread acknowledgement of its status as an urgent matter of public health. Groups such as the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative and Fertility for Colored Girls have tried to debunk the hyper-fertility myth while also\u00a0raising awareness about infertility in the Black community. We need to ensure that\u00a0assisted reproductive\u00a0technologies are available to everyone as part of public health policies.\nReproductive justice is about access to contraceptives and abortions, but it also means the freedom to be a parent. As a group of researchers and doctors wrote in the\u00a0American Journal of Public Health,\u00a0health justice requires that\u00a0\u201cevery obstetrics and gynecology department [make] racial equity in known areas of disparity the priority of all quality improvement projects\u201d.\nThe reproductive capacity of Black women has always been political, tied to the dark history of forced reproduction under slavery, and forced sterilisation in the era of Jim Crow. Rather than believing in a myth of Black fertility conceived in America\u2019s history of racist paternalism, reproductive justice means understanding the actual fertility of Black folks rather than projecting stereotypes. Only then can we escape the shame surrounding strained fertility journeys and provide full access to care, as part of a broader programme for racial equity in reproductive health.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.\u00a0\naj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
