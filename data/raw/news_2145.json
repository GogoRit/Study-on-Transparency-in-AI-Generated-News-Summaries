It is a beautiful, quiet film that packs an emotional and philosophical punch far beyond its weight.\n\nAlways on the lookout for a film that is better than the formulaic, ideologically-driven entertainment that is delivered by our media masters, I was pleased when my brother-in-law recommended Still Life\u2014a beautiful and reflective little film for which European directors still manage to find the funding.\nReleased in 2013 and directed by Uberto Pasolini, the film has won several international awards and is quietly and steadily finding its well-deserved wider audience. Mr. Pasolini\u2019s film centers on the middle-aged John May (Eddie Marsan) who works in the Bona Vacantia office in the Kennington Town Hall in London. \u201cBona Vacantia\u201d (for those not in the know) is a legal term for property that has no owner.\nMay\u2019s job is to track down the heirs of people who have died alone without a will and, when failing to do so, to dispose of their belongings. He also takes it upon himself to write a eulogy and arrange and attend the funerals for the suicides and solitary souls.\nWorking from a broom cupboard office, May is methodical and detail-oriented in his work\u2014even obsessive-compulsive. Living alone in a depressing local government apartment block, the only difference between John May and the lonely people he serves is that he is still alive.\nAs the story unfolds, May\u2019s bureaucratic bosses find his work time-consuming and expensive, and decide to close his office. May then embarks on a quest to find the relatives of his final case William \u201cBilly\u201d Stoke. Using photographs found in Stoke\u2019s apartment, May eventually tracks down a few friends and family members only to uncover the tragic wreckage of a broken life, broken family, broken career, and broken heart.\nI will not spoil the moving and meaningful ending of the film, but suffice it to say that May\u2019s quest to wind up Billy Stoke\u2019s life in a respectful way leads him to Stoke\u2019s daughter played by Joanne Froggatt (Anna from Downton Abbey). She shows interest in John May, and suddenly enlivened by a positive new direction in his life, just as he sets out for their tryst, May is intercepted by a London double-decker bus\u2014is there a sly wink that the bus is called a \u201cNew Routemaster\u201d?\nMr. Pasolini\u2019s picture is subtle, observant, textured, and thoughtful. The term \u201cBona Vacantia\u201d becomes a metaphor for the whole film. Bachelor John May, like the deceased he serves, is property that belongs to no one, and his work in a faceless bureaucracy and life in an anonymous wasteland like London becomes a symbol of modern man abandoned and in search of his soul. One is reminded of T.S. Eliot\u2019s vision of London, echoing Dante:\n\nUnreal City,\nUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn,\nA crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\nI had not thought death had undone so many.\nSighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\nAnd each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\n\nDirector Uberto Pasolini is the nephew of filmmaker Luchino Visconti. After working as an investment banker, he set out to work in the film industry, working with British director David Puttnam. With credits in The Frog Prince and The Mission, he continued to learn his new craft by working his way up through production to eventually direct his own film projects. His films have all been noted for a strong sympathy for ordinary heroes, but Still Life brings that respect for human life to the fore in a powerful way\u2014and all the more powerful for its remarkable understatement.\nBeneath the simple story of John May we perceive the intrinsic dignity and worth of each human life. As it turns out, Billy Stokes is neither a success nor a likable person. A low-life ex-con, he has abandoned the women in his life and ignored his only child. Only one step removed from the winos in the street who remember him, Stokes is a sad\u2014even despicable\u2014specimen of humanity, but John May treats him with the same quiet dignity and respect that he brings to all the sad people who are Bona Vacantia\u2014lost souls.\nIn the final scene Mr. Pasolini takes the courageous step of opening out from John May\u2019s grey and unassuming life to reveal its true and eternal value. Still Life is a haunting, original, and moving tribute to human worth and self-sacrificial love at the street level. I would place it in the same category with the classic Babette\u2019s Feast as a beautiful, quiet film that packs an emotional and philosophical punch far beyond its weight.\nThe Imaginative Conservative\u00a0applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics\u2014we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility.
