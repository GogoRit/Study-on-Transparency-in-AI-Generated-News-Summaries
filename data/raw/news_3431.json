Arguments for and against abortion tend to revolve around definitions. When does life begin? What is a person? What does viability mean?\nDefinitions are powerful. They don\u2019t just categorize and clarify; they advocate and argue. In other words, definitions are not neutral.\nConsider H.L. Mencken\u2019s famous definition of Puritanism\u2014\"the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy\u201d\u2014which only reinforced inaccurate conceptions of what the Puritans believed. Or the popular maxim of feminist activist Marie Shear that feminism \u201cis the radical notion that women are people.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful line: who could deny that women are people?\nThose of us in the pro-life movement must understand what we stand for. And that starts with defining the term \u201cpro-life\u201d itself. When we call ourselves \u201cpro-life,\u201d what are we saying? What does \u201cpro-life\u201d mean?\nMerriam-Webster\u00a0defines \u201cpro-life\u201d as \u201copposed to abortion.\u201d While that much is true, it\u2019s a narrow and simplistic definition. Let\u2019s explore a more complete understanding of what it means to be pro-life.\nWhere did the term \u201cpro-life\u201d come from?\nEven before the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973, finding a supposed \u201cright\u201d to abortion in the Constitution, advocates were using \u201clife\u201d language in the abortion debate.  In 1967, a group of doctors, lawyers, and others banded together to encourage California Governor Ronald Reagan not to sign a pro-abortion bill. The advocates called themselves the Right to Life League.\n Two years after Roe was decided, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops finalized a document called the \u201cPastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities\u201d affirming the dignity of all human life and setting an agenda for education, pastoral care, public policy, and prayer.\nThe use of the term \u201cpro-life\u201d continued to grow during the 1970s as advocacy on behalf of the unborn became a major political force. In   Before Roe v. Wade: Voices that Shaped the Abortion Debate Before the Supreme Court's Ruling, Linda Greenhouse and Reva Siegel of Yale Law School write, \u201cWhen conservatives of the New Right began to assemble a pan-Christian coalition against Roe in the late 1970s, the crusade against Roe would proceed under the banner of \u2018pro-life\u2019 and \u2018pro-family.\u2019\u201d\nThe term has stuck.\nPro-life vs. pro-choice\nPeople who support abortion-on-demand are often described in the media as \u201cpro-choice.\u201d It\u2019s a convenient term: the word \u201cchoice\u201d has few negative connotations, and identifying as being for something engenders much more sympathy than being against something.\nBut \u201cpro-choice\u201d is simply not an accurate term for supporters of legalized abortion. First, the term fails to answer an important question: what choice? The answer, of course, is a woman\u2019s choice to abort her unborn child. Planned Parenthood, perhaps the foremost \u201cpro-choice\u201d organization in the United States, defines the term this way: \u201cWhen you say you\u2019re pro-choice you\u2019re telling people that you believe it\u2019s OK for them to have the ability to choose abortion as an option for an unplanned pregnancy \u2014 even if you wouldn\u2019t choose abortion for yourself.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s another problem with the term \u201cpro-choice\u201d: it treats abortion as the only choice available to women facing unplanned pregnancies or uncertain futures.\nPeople who call themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d support choices too: parenting and adoption are choices not just accepted but championed by pro-life advocates. Pro-life organizations such as Heartbeat International have affiliates that are licensed adoption agencies. Others, like the Radiance Foundation, promote adoption through education and awareness campaigns. And many more, including the March for Life, celebrate National Adoption Awareness Month in November.\nAnd what about \u201cpro-choice\u201d organizations? In 2019, Planned Parenthood, America\u2019s largest abortion provider, performed 133 abortions  for every one adoption referral. Does that sound like an organization dedicated to \u201cchoice\u201d?\nIronically, it is pro-lifers who are truly \u201cpro-choice.\u201d\nAnd that definition brings us to another question.\nDoes \u201cpro-life\u201d just mean \u201cpro-birth\u201d?\nA common complaint of pro-abortion activists is that pro-lifers are merely \u201cpro-birth.\u201d In other words, their interest in protecting life extends only to life in the womb. But this argument is a strawman.\nAccording to the  Charlotte Lozier Institute, 2,700 pro-life pregnancy centers across the U.S. served nearly two million people in 2019. And the  National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA)\u00a0is a network of pro-life pregnancy centers that \u201cempower \u2026 women \u2026. to choose life for their unborn children.\u201d The network includes over 1,600 centers, including 1,200 licensed medical clinics.\nAnd those organizations don't just preserve the lives of unborn children; they provide mothers with diapers and baby outfits and offer them parenting classes and prenatal education programs. In 2019, the estimated value of all those services was nearly $270 million.\nAs the facts about adoption agencies and the statistics about pregnancy centers indicate, pro-life advocates care for more than just the unborn.\nIs \u201cpro-life\u201d anti-woman?\nAnother fallacious argument employed against pro-life advocates is that pro-lifers are really \u201canti-woman.\u201d\nIn 2020, the March for Life\u2014the annual gathering of hundreds of thousands of pro-life advocates in Washington, D.C.\u2014chose as its theme \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman.\u201d The March is held each year to mark Roe\u2019s anniversary, but in 2020, it was commemorating another historical landmark: the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote.\nLanguage that characterizes pro-life advocacy as \u201canti-woman\u201d often comes with a remarkable assumption: that women cannot be mothers and lead happy and successful lives. Of course, that conception is not only false; it\u2019s also, ironically, anti-woman.\nFurthermore, many of the abortion laws Alliance Defending Freedom has defended have included provisions designed to protect and empower women.\nConsider  Planned Parenthood of Montana v. State of Montana. In that case, Planned Parenthood sued after the Montana State Legislature adjusted the state\u2019s long-standing health-and-safety protections designed to help protect women and unborn children.\nSpecifically, the legislature aimed to ensure that women would not be prescribed dangerous chemical abortion drugs without first being physically examined by a doctor. Additionally, expectant mothers would be offered an opportunity to see and hear an ultrasound of their child in the womb.\nPregnant women deserve health and safety\u2014and they don\u2019t forfeit that protection when they consider having an abortion. But it\u2019s not Planned Parenthood standing up for them; it\u2019s pro-lifers.\nPro-life for all of life\nIt is not just unborn children whose lives are in dire need of protection. Sadly, our culture often devalues the lives of the elderly and infirm as well.\nIn recent years, advocates for  physician-assisted suicide\u00a0have sought to expand access to the practice throughout the country. As in the abortion debate, activists use positive-sounding language to make their cause sound noble. \u201cPhysician-assisted suicide\u201d becomes \"death with dignity.\" However, the practice targets the vulnerable and the sick\u2014and harms those who need competent and compassionate medical care and community services.\nADF is committed to fostering a culture of life where the dignity of all human beings is defended. The most vulnerable among us\u2014the elderly, the terminally ill, the disabled, and the depressed\u2014are worthy of life and equal protection under the law.\nLife should be protected from conception to natural death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bradley Evans\n      \n\n        News & Commentary Editor\n      \n\n        Bradley Evans serves as News & Commentary Editor at Alliance Defending Freedom\n      \n\n\n          View Profile \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordsmithing Versus Reality\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Unforgivable Deceptions on Chemical-Abortion Drugs\u2028\n\n\n\n          March 15, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Abortion Drugs, It's Time for the FDA To Put Women's Health First\n\n\n\n          March 12, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Fails Its Own Drug Test\n\n\n\n          March 7, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
