\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Argentina could make history on Tuesday, as its Senate votes on a bill to legalize abortion.\n    \n\n            The Senate voted 38-29 to give millions of women access to legal terminations under a new law supported by President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez. The margin was expected to be much smaller.\n    \n\n            Massive crowds of abortion rights activists and anti-abortion campaigners gathered outside the Palace of the Argentine National Congress to await the results, which came in the early hours of the morning after an overnight debate. Supporters of the bill greeted the news with loud cheers \u2013 and, in some cases, tears of joy. \n    \n\n            Gabriela Giacomelli, whose two sisters had illegal abortions, called the scene \u201cvery emotional.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cWe have been fighting for years,\u201d Giacomelli said. \u201cI see young people now, though I hope they never have to abort, but if they do now they can do it safely.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights activists celebrate after the Senate approved a bill to legalize abortion outside Congress in Buenos Aires on Wednesday morning. \n\nEmiliano Lasalvia/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n            Mariela Belski, executive director of Amnesty International Argentina and an ambassador for the global women\u2019s rights movement She Decides, said: \u201cToday, Argentina has made an emblematic step forward in defending the rights of women, girls and people with reproductive capacity.\u201d\n    \n\n            The law will legalize abortion in all cases up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Abortion in Argentina, South America\u2019s third-most populous country, is currently only permitted when a pregnancy results from rape or endangers the life or health of the woman.\n    \n\n            In all other circumstances, abortion is illegal and punishable by up to 15 years in jail.\n    \n\n            Abortion advocates hope Argentina\u2019s decision will spur similar movements in Latin America\u2019s other Catholic-majority states.\n    \n\n            Belski said that the move sends \u201ca strong message of hope to our entire continent \u2013 that we can change course against the criminalization of abortion and against clandestine abortions, which pose serious risks to the health and lives of millions of people. Both the law passed by the Argentine Congress today and the enormous effort of the women\u2019s movement to achieve this are an inspiration to the Americas, and to the world.\u201d\n    \n\n            Across Latin America and the Caribbean region, only Cuba, Uruguay, French Guiana and Guyana allow for elective abortions, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. In Mexico City and the Mexican state of Oaxaca, abortions are also available on request, but are severely restricted throughout the rest of Mexico.  \n    \n\n            By contrast, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Suriname ban abortions in nearly all circumstances. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama allow for abortion only if it\u2019s to preserve the woman\u2019s health or help save her life.\u00a0\n    \n\n            While abortions remain largely restricted or illegal throughout the region, approximately 5.4 million abortions took place in Latin America and the Caribbean between 2015 and 2019, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. Its research has found that unintended pregnancy rates are highest in countries that restrict abortion access and lowest in countries where abortion is broadly legal.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn anti-abortion campaigner reacts after the Senate voted in favor of a bill to legalize abortion on Wednesday. \n\nMarcos Brindicci/AP\n\n\n\n    \u2018Troubling numbers\u2019\n\n\n            Abortion has long been a divisive issue in Argentina, and the vote galvanized activists on both sides of the debate.\n    \n\n            Abortion rights advocates wore green handkerchiefs in a movement that became known as the green wave. Anti-abortion activists dressed in blue \u2013 the color of the \u201csave both lives\u201d movement, and that of the national flag.\n    \n\n            Anti-abortion activist and student Agostina L\u00f3pez, 20, who protested against the bill on Tuesday, told CNN ahead of the vote that it signified \u201ca complete loss of values \u200b\u200bsuch as respect for life and for women.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cWithout the right to life none of the other rights make sense,\u201d L\u00f3pez said, adding that if the law passed, it would give a \u201cfalse message that the killing of innocent babies is no longer a serious (matter).\u201d\n    \n\n            Lucia Ricoveri, an activist who volunteers with the anti-abortion youth movement \u201cFrente Joven,\u201d told CNN on Wednesday that \u201ctoday, the country is in mourning\u201d and that the result \u201cclearly shows a failure of Argentinian policy.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cArgentina has always been a country full of life, a country of family and solidarity,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSenators clearly did not represent the people they were supposed to represent. They did not represent the Argentinian people.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion-rights activists, left, and activists against abortion, right, rally outside Argentina's Congress in the capitol of Buenos Aires on Tuesday as lawmakers debated a bill that legalized abortion. \n\nNatacha Pisarenko/AP\n\n\n\n            This vote isn\u2019t the first time the issue has gone to the Senate. In 2018, during the conservative administration of former President Mauricio Macri, an attempt to legalize abortion in Argentina passed the lower house, but was narrowly defeated in the Senate.\n    \n\n            Brenda Austin, one of four congresswomen who introduced the 2018 bill, said she received Wednesday\u2019s news with \u201cgreat emotion,\u201d adding that the decision is a \u201chistorical debt that our democracy owes to the rights of women.\u201d\n    \n\n            In recent months, the abortion rights movement received a huge boost from the support of President Fern\u00e1ndez, who came to power last December.\n    \n\n            In a recorded address shortly before his inauguration, Fern\u00e1ndez pledged to \u201cput an end to the criminalization of abortion.\u201d\n    \n\n            Wearing a green tie \u2013 a symbol of the abortion rights movement \u2013 Fern\u00e1ndez said criminalizing the procedure unfairly punishes \u201cvulnerable and poor women,\u201d adding they were the \u201cthe greatest victims\u201d of Argentina\u2019s legal system.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe criminalization of abortion has been of no use,\u201d he said, noting that it \u201chas only allowed abortions to occur clandestinely in troubling numbers.\u201d\n    \n\n            Fern\u00e1ndez said more than 3,000 people had died from illegal abortions since 1983. No official figures are available for how many illegal abortions take place in Argentina, but the National Health Ministry estimates that between 371,965 and 522,000 procedures are performed annually. \n    \n\n            According to a report from HRW, nearly 40,000 women and children in Argentina were hospitalized in 2016 as a result of unsafe, clandestine abortions or miscarriages. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic priests hold a mass during an anti-abortion protest as lawmakers debated its legalization, outside Congress in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.\n\nNatacha Pisarenko/AP\n\n\n\n            Citing National Health Ministry data, the HRW report found that 39,025 women and girls were admitted to public hospitals for health issues arising from abortions or miscarriages, and more than 6,000 were aged between 10 and 19.\n    \n\n            Experts say the new law will allow 13- to 16-year-olds with normal pregnancies to access abortion services without a guardian. Doctors will still have the option to \u201cconscientiously object\u201d to performing abortions, although the law states they will have to find another doctor to do so.\n    \n\n            The bill also uses inclusive language acknowledging that not all people who become pregnant identify as women.\n    \n\n            Camila Fernandez, a self-identifying transgender woman, who was instrumental in the push for the bill\u2019s language that reads \u201cpeople with ability to be pregnant,\u201d told CNN that youth and the LGBTQ community were instrumental in challenging an \u201cadult centrist and patriarchal power that has perpetuated privileges and injustices.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cHand in hand with trans men and non binary people we conquered the rights that today are theirs and ours,\u201d she said, adding that she believes the move will pave the way for additional reforms for trans people who have been historically sidelined.\n    \n\n    \u2018Troubling numbers\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuns demonstrate against the decriminalization of abortion as lawmakers debate its legalization, outside Congress in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.\n\nMarcos Brindicci/AP\n\n\n\n            The abortion debate has created tension in a country with deep Catholic ties.\n    \n\n            Argentina, the birthplace of Pope Francis, has seen a gradual rise in agnosticism in recent years, although 92% of Argentinians still identify as Roman Catholic, according to the CIA.\n    \n\n            Argentina\u2019s constitution cements government support for the Catholic Church and recognizes Roman Catholicism as the official religion. However, a 1994 amendment removed the requirement that the president must be Catholic.\n    \n\n            The Pope \u2013 and other Church leaders \u2013 have also weighed in on the debate.\n    \n\n            In a handwritten letter addressed to congresswoman and group intermediary Victoria Morales Gorleri, Francis said \u201cthe problem of abortion is not primarily a question of religion, but of human ethics, first and foremost of any religious denomination.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIs it fair to eliminate a human life to solve a problem? Is it fair to hire a hit man to solve a problem?\u201d he wrote.\n    \n\n            On Saturday, the Church of Argentina called on the Senate to vote against the bill, with Bishop Oscar Ojea, president of the local bishops\u2019 conference and an outspoken opponent of abortion saying that a vote against the bill was supported by \u201cmedical science and law,\u201d Reuters reported. \n    \n\n            On Wednesday, the Senate also passed a complimentary bill that will strengthen the social and economic safety net for pregnant individuals facing economic hardships who want to continue their pregnancies.\n    \n\n            The \u201c1,000 day plan\u201d will strengthen services from pregnancy up to the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life.\n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s George
