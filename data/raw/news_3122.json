News (AP)West Virginia Delegate Danielle Walker, received a Klu Klux Klan meme, on the first day of Black History Month, reported the Huffington Post. After actively fighting against the abortion ban legislation in the works, Walker\u2019s efforts and experiences were attacked by ignorant trolls.Mekhi Phifer Recalls The Impact The 'Soul Food' Movie Had On His Career, Plus Working With Beyonc\u00e9\n\n\n\n\n\nCCShare SubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoMekhi Phifer Recalls The Impact The 'Soul Food' Movie Had On His Career, Plus Working With Beyonc\u00e9Berkeley County West Virginians for Life, a pro-life group, emailed Walker an image of a Klan member giving a Nazi salute reading, \u201cWhat do you think the coward hiding under his dunce cap and face mask thinks everytime he hears about a Black child has been aborted? Be Pro-LIFE as if your race depended on it. It\u2019s the American thing to do!,\u201d via HuffPost. AdvertisementBesides the outrageous grammar and failed Black Lives Matter take, Walker was triggered by the comment that came with the image, reported HuffPost. \u201cThe idiot featured in the picture below is an ally of yours and holds the same beliefs you do that the killing of children look like you is a good thing,\u201d read the email to Walker via HuffPost.AdvertisementThey thought they ate (insert eye roll).From HuffPost:Walker began asking her mostly white colleagues in the House of Delegates if they\u2019d received anything like this. After all, she wasn\u2019t the only lawmaker backing the legislation to repeal abortion restrictions.\u201cNo one had received anything of the sort,\u201d said Walker, who added she has received death threats from anti-abortion groups before. White nationalists, like the Klan member featured in the email Walker received, have become increasingly enmeshed in the anti-abortion movement, and vice versa, media investigations have found.AdvertisementNot only did they take it to her email, but the group\u2019s chapter also posted the image to Facebook tagging Walker. The chapter president, Richard Demoske, apologized in a letter \u201cto whom it may concern\u201d stating the intention was to emphasize that racists support abortion of Black babies. \u201cIn an effort to oppose racism, I composed a poorly designed and easily misunderstood meme that unintentionally conveyed racism,\u201d read the letter. He concluded by announcing his resignation. AdvertisementWalker responded to the situation via Facebook live to further express her disgust with what happened, per HuffPost.From HuffPost:\u201cI am an abortion patient myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am also a mother \u2015 also a newly grieving mother as I lost my oldest son in June. So I take personal offense to this when you speak about Black children.\u201dWalker went public with her outrage earlier this week, broadcasting herself live on Facebook as a group of anti-abortion protesters gathered at the state Capitol building.\u201cFor some of you who have only seen a white sheet and that hat in movies but not up close and personal, you are privileged,\u201d a tearful Walker said on her livestream. She said she planned to leave the Capitol in protective gear that night.AdvertisementWalker continues to fight against the 15-week abortion ban the West Virginia GOP is working to pass. \u201cMy voice will not be hushed! I\u2019m still standing! I\u2019m still smiling! I\u2019m still serving! Enough is enough!\u201d wrote Walker via Twitter. To compare a Black woman to Klan member is one of the most ridiculous attempts to justify banning abortion. If these anti-abortion groups were really \u201cpro-life\u201d for Black children, they would be more concerned about their survival once they come out the womb.Continue reading\n\n"
