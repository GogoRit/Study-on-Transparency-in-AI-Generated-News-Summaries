But in Congress, where radical (and\u00a0well-funded) pro-abortion actors like\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0and NARAL have a stranglehold on the left, these perfectly reasonable bills are met with fierce opposition. Why?\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the two bills.\n1. Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\nThe act would protect women and unborn children from gruesome\u00a0late-term abortions\u00a0performed after 20 weeks. The U.S. is one of only\u00a0seven countries\u00a0in the world that allows elective abortion past 20 weeks (5 months), alongside countries like China and North Korea. Scientific evidence suggests that by 20 weeks, a baby is capable of\u00a0feeling\u00a0excruciating\u00a0pain\u00a0during an abortion procedure.\u00a0\nAt the state level, over a dozen states across the country have enacted 20-week bills. Congress is overdue to pass the bill at the federal level.\n2.\u00a0Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act\nIt is a matter of\u00a0public record, both in the United States and abroad, that some babies are born alive following attempted abortions. Because current law is insufficient to protect them, these infants are left vulnerable to neglect that can cause their deaths\u2014deaths that may have been preventable with adequate emergency care.\u00a0\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush signed legislation that extended legal protection to infants born alive at any stage of development, including after an abortion. However, the 2002 law did not contain enforcement provisions.\u00a0\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act augments current law by including criminal consequences for health care providers who violate the law, and it requires that proper medical care be given by the health care practitioner present if an infant is born alive. Treating a baby born after an attempted abortion with the same care provided to any other newborn should not be controversial in a civilized society.\nThese Bills Should Not Be Controversial\nKnowing that the vast majority of Americans support federal abortion policy that is far more restrictive than the status quo, you would think that Congress could agree that the Pain-Capable bill would be a practical policy to reflect our nationwide consensus. But every time the bill has received a vote in the Senate, it has failed to amass the 60 votes necessary to proceed.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood, NARAL, and other radical pro-abortion activists have spent many years establishing clout\u2014politically and financially\u2014on the left, and are unwilling to entertain even the slightest on late-term elective abortion. And the politicians beholden to them fall in line.\nBut what about the Born-Alive bill? Despite erroneous characterizations in the mainstream media, it isn\u2019t even an \u201cabortion bill.\u201d It\u2019s a bill that establishes that a living newborn baby who has survived an attempt on her life in the womb must be treated with appropriate medical care.\u00a0\nCritics tend to fall back on two main arguments: first, that such scenarios don\u2019t happen, and second, that current law sufficiently protects these newborns. And critics are wrong on both counts.\u00a0\nState and federal data acknowledges hundreds of such instances (that we know of). And while federal law acknowledges that infants who survive an abortion are \u201cpersons,\u201d it contains no requirement that they receive care.\u00a0\nFurthermore, instances of abortionists like Kermit Gosnell are distinguishable from the issue at hand in the Born-Alive bill. Gosnell was convicted for actively killing newborns, not for failing to provide medical treatment to newborns. The Born-Alive bill addresses the act of passively \u201cdoing nothing\u201d and allowing babies to die.\nIn any case, the abortion industry and its allies cannot allow the left to support the Born-Alive bill. Doing so would acknowledge the humanity of the unborn child, and present abortion for what it is: the intentional destruction of human life.\u00a0\nSenators will go on the record in support or opposition of two different policies. In doing so, they\u2019ll be forced to answer two questions. First, are you willing to draw the line at elective late-term abortion? And second\u2014especially if the answer to the first question was \u201cno\u201d\u2014are you willing to draw the line anywhere?\nAmerica\u2019s federal abortion policy is\u00a0radically out of step\u00a0with how the vast majority of Americans feel about the issue. The Senate has an opportunity to change that.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
