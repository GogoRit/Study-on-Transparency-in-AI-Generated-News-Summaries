The bright yellow letters read, \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter.\u201dAdvertisementAs the national debate over racism in the United States explodes and Black Lives Matter surges with unprecedented support, the anti-abortion movement has started adopting its own versions of the powerful rallying cry. Many abortion opponents, including those in the White House, are now championing slogans like \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cBaby Lives Matter.\u201dThe initiative ties anti-abortion crusaders\u2019 cause to one of the biggest social movements to sweep the United States in years. And it\u2019s the latest twist in a decades-long history of intertwining anti-abortion ideology with the fight for racial equality\u2014a history that, according to Black supporters of abortion rights, has largely lacked Black people.\u201cThey use this, to co-opt this messaging, so that they can sound like they are the social justice warriors,\u201d said Renee Bracey Sherman, executive director of We Testify, which fights for better representation of people who\u2019ve had abortions. \u201cThey are just trying to copy whatever it is that the Black Lives Matter are doing, what Black people are doing, and perverting it and gentrifying it to focus on their issue.\u201dIn early September, Students for Life of America, the nation\u2019s preeminent student group for anti-abortion activism, formed a coalition with a handful of Black-led organizations to put up six billboards in what spokesperson Kristi Hamrick described as \u201cpredominantly Black communities\u201d in Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Charlotte, North Carolina. The billboards, which feature a clenched baby fist, declare, \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter.\u201d The coalition was also behind the mural in Baltimore, as well as a similar one in Washington, D.C.Advertisement\u201cIt is a national tragedy, the loss of life within the Black community from abortion,\u201d said Hamrick, who identifies as \u201cEuropean American.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna talk about how Black Lives Matter and how Black lives are being impacted by current social constructs and organizations and policies, abortion is among those things.\u201dHamrick didn\u2019t return a VICE News request for clarity on the demographics of Students for Life\u2019s top staffers by press time, but said, \u201cWe have team members of every race, creed, and color.\u201dThe billboards and murals have certainly attracted attention, which is, after all, part of the point of enormous billboards and murals. Last month, Washington, D.C., police arrested two activists who wrote the \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter\u201d mural in chalk; they were charged with defacing public or private property, the Washington Post reported.Afterward, four Republican congressmen sent letters to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the head of the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division. The congressmen, including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, accused Washington, D.C., of \u201cunconstitutional viewpoint discrimination\u201d because the district had left a \u201cDefund the Police\u201d mural intact for more than two months.There will be legal action, Hamrick promised VICE News.An unrelated GoFundMe to raise money for 10 \u201cBaby Lives Matter\u201d murals in front of Planned Parenthood clinics across the country has also garnered more than $19,000. Tayler Hansen, the fundraiser\u2019s organizer, has so far painted murals in Salt Lake City; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Hansen, who didn\u2019t reply to an interview request, supports President Donald Trump and recently tweeted, \u201cBLACK LIVES MATTER IS RACIST!\u201dAdvertisement\u201cI support all life, but the ones that have no voice at all need to be heard,\u201d commented one donor, who handed over $150.\u201cWhat a great idea! Proclaiming baby lives matter goes hand in hand with the Black Lives Matter movement since so many Black lives are lost due to abortion,\u201d another wrote, adding a frown-faced emoticon. That donor gave $100.Even Trump\u2014who condemned New York City\u2019s decision to paint \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in front of Trump Tower as a \u201csymbol of hate\u201d\u2014has tried to spin the movement\u2019s popularity into an anti-abortion message and profit from it. In June, at the height of the initial wave of protests, the Trump campaign sold limited-edition onesies with \u201cBaby Lives Matter\u201d stamped on them.Anti-abortion billboards aren\u2019t a new idea. Over the last decade, activists have run several bearing messages like \u201cThe Most Dangerous Place for an African American Is in the Womb\u201d and \u201cBlack Children Are An Endangered Species.\u201d These campaigns often rely on statistics that show that Black women are overrepresented among abortion patients.A study of abortion rates between 2008 and 2014, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that non-Hispanic Black women had the highest abortion rate\u201427.1 abortions per every 1,000 women\u2014out of all studied groups. Non-Hispanic white women accounted for the most abortions in total but had the lowest rate, at 10 abortions per every 1,000. Hispanic women made up 18.1 abortions per every 1,000, while non-Hispanic women who didn\u2019t identify as white or Black had a rate of 16.3 abortions per every 1,000.AdvertisementAnti-abortion activist Catherine Davis helped spearhead the campaign to erect billboards that called Black children an \u201cendangered species\u201d in Georgia in 2010. The group she leads, the Restoration Project, is now listed as a partner in the effort to spread the message that \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter.\u201d\u201cAs long as I\u2019ve gotten you to stop what you\u2019re doing and think about that message, then I\u2019ve achieved the purpose of the messaging, because you\u2019re now thinking about it,\u201d said Davis, who is Black. \u201cBefore they painted \u2018Black Preborn Lives Matter\u2019 in front of that Planned Parenthood, that wasn\u2019t something that people were thinking about.\u201dThe idea that abortion is part of a \u201cBlack genocide\u201d continues to persist. In 2019, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2014who would likely play a key role in any forthcoming effort to overturn Roe v. Wade\u2014raised its ghost in an opinion. He called abortion \u201can act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation\u201d and implored his fellow justices to redefine the scope of legal abortion.Public health experts say the overrepresentation of Black women among abortion patients isn\u2019t proof of a vast racist conspiracy. Instead, they point to the innumerable ways that U.S. society disadvantages people of color and low-income communities; Black people in those demographics often have less access to health care as well as jobs and educational opportunities, to name just a few.AdvertisementFor Bracey Sherman, these types of billboards perpetuate racist, sexist stereotypes against Black women.\u201cEspecially the one [where] they said the most dangerous place for a Black child is in the womb. If you think about that, whose womb? It\u2019s inherently saying that Black women are inherently dangerous to their own children, which is playing off of so many tropes, like the welfare queen, that Black women talk back, they\u2019re violent,\u201d she said.\u201cNone of this is new,\u201d she continued. \u201cI mean, after I had my abortion, when Obama was elected, they set up billboards on the south side of Chicago that said, \u2018Every 21 seconds our next leader is aborted.\u2019\u201dBlack adults in the U.S. overwhelmingly support abortion rights\u2014or at least they vote like they do. More than 80% of Black voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, according to the Pew Research Center. Nearly 60% of Black voters also believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the Public Religion Research Institute found. (Overall, seven in 10 Americans do not support completely overturning Roe v. Wade.)Pamela Merritt, who co-founded the abortion rights-supporting organization Reproaction, believes the variations on the \u201cBaby Lives Matter\u201d theme aren\u2019t really meant to appeal to Black people but to white conservatives who may be feeling conflicted over their party\u2019s devotion to a president with a record of downplaying violent white supremacy. She\u2019s seen a few anti-abortion activists appear at the \u201coutskirts\u201d of Black Lives Matter protests in her hometown of St. Louis. That heartens her.Advertisement\u201cAny time the opposition is developing messaging to try and keep their people from feeling guilty about the policies\u2014and the lack of policy\u2014to address Black lives, then you are winning,\u201d said Merritt, who is Black.\u201cThey can be justice warriors\u201dThe anti-abortion movement has previously used progressive rhetoric to make its point. As the modern movement took shape in the 1960s and \u201970s\u2014and after the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in its landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade\u2014abortion opponents cast themselves as part of the civil rights movement.The framing made sense to many within the movement at the time, according to Jennifer Holland, an assistant professor in the history department at the University of Oklahoma who wrote \u201cTiny You: A Western History of the Anti-Abortion Movement.\u201d Not only were many of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s biggest proponents Democratic, working-class Catholics who may have sympathized with the civil rights movement, but the idea that a fetus is a person who deserves full rights and protections\u00a0also lies at the heart of pro-life logic.\u201cFrom 1973 into the 21st century, basically what it is you have an almost entirely white movement that is co-opting Black struggles in order to put the fetus into\u2014to cast it in this light of this oppressed, murdered minorities. This entity that we care less about, just like we cared less about Black people, just like people devalued Jews in Germany,\u201d Holland said. (Finding parallels between abortion and the Nazi Holocaust remains a popular activity among anti-abortion activists.)Advertisement\u201cThey are just trying to copy whatever it is that the Black Lives Matter are doing, what Black people are doing, and perverting it and gentrifying it to focus on their issue.\u201dIn hitching themselves to the civil rights movement, anti-abortion activists harnessed deeply powerful messaging\u00a0and aligned themselves with the fight to realize the promise of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, which was ratified in the years following the Civil War and prevents discrimination on the basis of race. At the time, anti-abortion activists wanted the 14th Amendment\u00a0to apply to fetuses, according to Mary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law who specializes in the legal history of reproduction.By portraying abortion as a civil rights issue, white activists could also avoid reckoning with their own role in oppression, according to Holland.\u201cThey wanted to feel grounded as moral human beings who were a part of a justice movement,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you co-opt these sorts of struggles and you make abortion akin to slavery, then white people can be abolitionists, they can be justice warriors.\u201dAlthough many speakers at the Republican National Convention in August spent much of their time railing about the need for \u201claw and order\u201d\u2014a coded rebuttal to the Black Lives Matter protests\u2014evidence suggests that white Republicans are supportive of the movement:\u00a0 37% say they support Black Lives Matter to some degree, the Pew Research Center found. And as many anti-abortion activists turn to the task of reelecting Trump, some appear to believe spotlighting race is a path to victory.AdvertisementThis year, given just five minutes to make her case for Trump at the RNC, anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson accused abortion-rights supporters of championing racism. She called Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood\u2019s founder, \u201ca racist who believed in eugenics\u201d and said that most Planned Parenthood abortion clinics are \u201cstrategically located in minority neighborhoods.\u201dThe Guttmacher Institute, which studies abortion restrictions, has found that six in 10 abortion providers are in neighborhoods where most residents are white.Scholars still debate Sanger\u2019s exact views on race, but shedid support eugenics and courted its backers to her birth control movement. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York\u2014whose CEO was recently ousted after allegations of unequal treatment of Black staffers\u2014recently announced its plan to remove Sanger\u2019s name from its Manhattan health center.The U.S. feminist movement, with its longtime emphasis on middle-class and wealthy white women, has a legacy of shutting out people of color and their needs. In the 1990s, a group of Black women coined the term \u201creproductive justice\u201d to describe a movement fought for by activists from marginalized groups. Bracey Sherman and Merritt both align themselves with the reproductive justice framework, which conceptualizes bodily autonomy and parenting\u2014or not parenting\u2014as a human right.Now some of the most prominent anti-abortion organizations in the United States are named after people\u2014including feminists\u2014\u201cwho stepped on and over Black women,\u201d as Bracey Sherman put it.Stanton International, a chain of anti-abortion centers listed as one of the supporters of the \u201cBlack Preborn Lives Matter\u201d initiative, takes its name from suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Both Stanton and Susan B. Anthony\u2014the namesake of the Susan B. Anthony List, which has pledged to donate millions to backing anti-abortion candidates this year\u2014leveraged racist rhetoric to try to fight off the 14th and 15th Amendments, which helped enfranchise Black men but did not allow white women to vote.\u201cI will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work for or demand the ballot for the Negro and not for the woman,\u201d Anthony once announced.A few weeks before the Republicans\u2019 convention, Johnson expressed her own support for a \u201cBaby Lives Matter\u201d-type campaign. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s time for me to lead a campaign to paint \u2018Unborn Lives Matter\u2019 outside of every abortion clinic in the country. I\u2019m not much for getting arrested, but I\u2019m feeling like maybe this would show the blatant hypocrisy running rampant in our society today,\u201d she tweeted.The day Johnson, who is white, spoke at the RNC, VICE News reported that she had recorded a video where she said police would be \u201csmart\u201d to profile her biracial son.Tagged:TrumpmuralBillboardBlack Lives MatterprotestRacial Justiceanti-abortion8:46 NewsThe 8:46 ProjectGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
