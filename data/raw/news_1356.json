It is critical to women\u2019s equal participation in society. Abortion access affects women\u2019s physical and mental health, their ability to get an education, their experiences with hardship and poverty, and their employment and earnings prospects.\u00a0An abortion ban\u00a0would\u00a0reinforce the economic inequality that already characterizes the economy of our state.\u00a0\nAdding a child during a time of financial instability often plunges individuals and families into\u00a0deeper or chronic poverty, unable to work their way out of persistent hardship as disadvantages\u00a0snowball.\n\n\nA\u00a0ban on abortion would be financially costly for\u00a0the\u00a0state as\u00a0well. Any public policy that increases poverty and economic hardship and reduces employment\u00a0will have an impact on\u00a0the labor force, as well as on\u00a0already strained safety net supports such as Temporary\u00a0Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),\u00a0WIC, and Medicaid.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is difficult to develop a precise estimate\u00a0of\u00a0the impact of\u00a0a\u00a0total ban on abortion\u00a0in Pennsylvania.\u00a0But recent work by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy\u00a0Research (IWPR) can give us\u00a0a\u00a0handle on this question.\u00a0Last year,\u00a0IWPR released a study\u00a0of the economic impact of abortion bans and targeted restrictions\u00a0on abortion providers.\u00a0\nThey\u00a0estimate that absent\u00a0Pennsylvania\u2019s\u00a0current restrictions, there would be an\u00a0increase of 22,048 Pennsylvania women,\u00a0aged\u00a015-44,\u00a0in the labor force. That would\u00a0lead employed Pennsylvania women\u00a0in this age group\u00a0to earn an additional\u00a0$5.3 billion. These estimates do not\u00a0take\u00a0into account\u00a0the increased social safety net costs\u00a0associated with the higher rates of poverty experienced by families who would be denied abortions\u00a0under a Pennsylvania ban.\u00a0\n\n\nIf a full abortion ban is enacted in Pennsylvania, it is uncertain exactly how many more women\u00a0would be prevented from abortion access. But currently,\u00a0more than\u00a032,000 abortions take place in the state\u00a0each year. We would expect that if a total ban\u00a0were\u00a0put in place, some people seeking abortion would\u00a0secure\u00a0one in another state.\u00a0\nBut there are currently only 18 clinics that offer abortions in Pennsylvania, and opponents of abortion are considering\u00a0aggressive laws\u00a0in\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0and\u00a0other states around the\u00a0country.\u00a0Ohio and West Virginia,\u00a0our western border neighbors, already have more restrictive abortion policy environments\u00a0than Pennsylvania.\u00a0\nThis context, along with the fact that many\u00a0abortion patients\u00a0are poor\u2014thus\u00a0making it difficult for them to travel\u2014leads\u00a0us to\u00a0expect that\u00a0under a state ban,\u00a0many Pennsylvanians\u00a0would be forced to give birth to unwanted children. Many would\u00a0attempt\u00a0an unsafe, self-induced\u00a0abortion. \nIf two-thirds of the\u00a0clinic\u00a0abortions\u00a0that take place in our state now are blocked by new restrictive laws, the number of prevented\u00a0clinic\u00a0abortions\u00a0in our state would double. And that means that the economic cost of a full abortion ban\u00a0in Pennsylvania would be more than double the IWPR estimate of the cost of current restrictions\u00a0or\u00a0more than\u00a0$10 billion yearly in Pennsylvania alone.\u00a0\n\n\nSafe abortion access is a\u00a0life-or-death\u00a0situation for women and others across the\u00a0Commonwealth.
