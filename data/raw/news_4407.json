In our Georgia report, we\u00a0acknowledge outright\u00a0that many\u00a0domestic policymakers\u00a0\u201care not necessarily concerned with whether or not state practices adhere to human rights principles.\u201d\u00a0So why\u00a0did we\u00a0nevertheless\u00a0inject them into\u00a0our\u00a0advocacy?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFirst and foremost, international\u00a0human rights concepts\u00a0uniquely\u00a0bolstered our\u00a0analysis\u00a0of state practices: they\u00a0clarified\u00a0connections between\u00a0upstream\u00a0policy decisions\u00a0and\u00a0downstream\u00a0health outcomes\u00a0for pregnant women\u00a0of color\u00a0in Georgia and sex workers in\u00a0Connecticut.\u00a0Although\u00a0the obligations we attached to the state\u00a0were not framed with reference to\u00a0UN\u00a0treaties,\u00a0global human rights\u00a0allowed\u00a0for the\u00a0identification\u00a0and systematization of\u00a0harms\u00a0that may otherwise\u00a0have\u00a0been difficult to catalogue\u00a0and attribute to\u00a0root causes.\nWe\u00a0see\u00a0human rights as\u00a0a powerful way\u00a0to\u00a0translate\u00a0international\u00a0principles into transformative, empirically-supported,\u00a0measurable\u00a0domestic\u00a0policy\u00a0demands.\u00a0\n\n\nHuman rights frameworks didn\u2019t just help organize our critiques of broken systems; they also provided the glue for us as researchers to collaborate with advocate partners and imagine affirmative fulfilments of SRHR. For instance, human rights frames helped GHJP to continue engaging with SWAN in crafting demands for city policymakers, such as\u00a0this AAAQ-informed analysis\u00a0on the COVID-19\u00a0response\u00a0in New Haven. The imaginative capacity of human rights language enables discussions of radically different futures characterized by welfare and well-being in \u201cscofflaw\u201d countries where preventing harm is usually the (minimalist) primary focus.\n\n\nWe\u00a0see\u00a0human rights as\u00a0a powerful way\u00a0to\u00a0translate\u00a0international\u00a0principles into transformative, empirically-supported,\u00a0measurable\u00a0domestic\u00a0policy\u00a0demands.\u00a0However,\u00a0the choice to wield human rights in somewhat covert fashion\u2014without\u00a0direct\u00a0reference to international legal obligations\u2014admittedly\u00a0has its downsides. What\u00a0is\u00a0gained\u00a0in\u00a0local political traction\u00a0comes with\u00a0a potential loss in\u00a0human rights awareness:\u00a0domestic\u00a0policymakers\u00a0in\u00a0laggard\u00a0countries\u00a0get no exposure to the idea of legally-binding international human rights nor\u00a0to\u00a0reflecting on\u00a0their\u00a0acts as part of a\u00a0common\u00a0global\u00a0commitment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nYet our\u00a0pragmatic\u00a0strategy\u00a0is a function of collaborating\u00a0with on-the-ground advocates\u00a0whose commitment is\u00a0to the world within their grasp; they regularly make\u00a0demands of\u00a0policy-makers\u00a0who\u00a0don\u2019t give a damn about flouting\u00a0IHRL\u00a0norms\u00a0and UN treaties.\u00a0\u00a0For this reason,\u00a0we note\u00a0in closing\u00a0that\u00a0the practice of using\u00a0rights\u00a0covertly\u00a0is not uncommon among advocates working in constrained contexts:\u00a0the transformative trick\u00a0is to\u00a0use a\u00a0common set\u00a0of principles,\u00a0derived\u00a0from the\u00a0content\u00a0of\u00a0IHRL,\u00a0so that the\u00a0\u201cgotcha\u201d\u00a0hook\u00a0of\u00a0international obligations\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0made\u00a0at the right\u00a0time,\u00a0even in scofflaw countries.\n\u00a0\n\nThis piece is part of a series published in partnership with Occidental College\u2019s\u00a0Young Initiative on the Global Political Economy,\u00a0division of Social Sciences at Arizona State University, and USC\u2019s\u00a0Institute on Inequalities in Global Health.
