RIGHT: A portrait of Father Pro. (photo: Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\n\nKathy Schiffer \nBlogs\nNovember 23, 2020\n\n\nGot Faith? And what\u2019s it worth to you?\nOn this day, people of faith remember 20th-century martyr Blessed Miguel Pro, a Jesuit priest who died by firing squad on Nov. 23, 1927. His joy and courage in the face of execution are an example to all of us. While we will most likely never be asked to defend to the death our deepest held beliefs, we do face \u201clittle\u201d persecutions \u2014 the scorn of nonbelieving co-workers, or the disdain and disregard of liberal media \u2014 on a daily basis. Miguel Pro shows us how to persist in faith, even when the cost of discipleship may be great.\nMiguel Agust\u00edn Pro was born in Guadalupe, Zacatecas, in central Mexico, in 1891. He entered the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) in 1911 \u2014 just as the Mexican Revolution got under way \u2014 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1925.\nWhen Father Pro returned to Mexico in 1926 to serve at Veracruz, he was forced to go \u201cunderground.\u201d The Mexican president at that time, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, vigorously enforced the anti-Catholic provisions of the constitution \u2014 imprisoning priests who criticized the government, and fining any who wore clerical garb outside their churches.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities took advantage of an attempted assassination plot to arrest and charge Miguel Pro \u2014 ostensibly for the assassination attempt, but in reality for continuing to defend and spread the Catholic faith. Although Pro was innocent of any charges, President Calles gave orders that he should be executed by firing squad.\nTo the end, Father Pro embraced his faith. On Nov. 23, 1927, as Father Pro was led from his prison cell to the courtyard where the firing squad would take his life, he stopped and blessed the soldiers. He paused for a minute, knelt on the ground and prayed quietly. Father Pro refused a blindfold, instead facing his executioners with a crucifix in one hand and a rosary in the other. He held out his arms in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, \u201cMay God have mercy on you! May God bless you! Lord, Thou knowest I am innocent! With all my heart I forgive my enemies.\u201d\nHis last words before the firing squad were \u201cViva Cristo Rey\u201d (\u201cLong live Christ the King!\u201d)\nPerhaps the first Christian martyr of the contemporary era, Father Pro was photographed before the firing squad. Photos of his execution were widely circulated in the newspapers of the day; but the government\u2019s plan to instill fear backfired, and instead others were inspired to remain staunch in their belief.\n\n\nKeywords: \nchrist the king\nmartyrs\nblessed Miguel pro\n\n\n\n\nKathy Schiffer Kathy Schiffer is a Catholic blogger.

What\u2019s the origin of this powerful solemnity? We find out with EWTN News\u2019 Dr. Matthew Bunson. Then we look at another effort to sanctity the world \u2014 this time through sacred monastic music. Yet there\u2019s a twist: Artificial Intelligence is involved. The Register\u2019s Sol\u00e8ne Tadi\u00e9 brings us a story of how an organization is using AI to help spread sacred monastic music.\n\n\nJeanette De Melo\nRegister Radio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Last Judgment, Christ the King Will Sit Upon His Glorious Throne\n\nSCRIPTURES & ART: The Register\u2019s three-year \u201cScriptures & Art\u201d feature concludes with a look at the readings for the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe\n\n\nJohn Grondelski\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrist the King: Pope Pius XI\u2019s Hope for \u2018Lasting Peace Among the Nations\u2019\n\nAmid those upheavals and turbulent regime changes, Pope Pius XI in his encyclical argued that \u2018men must look for the peace of Christ in the kingdom of Christ.\u2019\n\n\nDaniel Payne/CNA\nVatican\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland\u2019s Controversial New Hate Crime Law Set to Come Into Effect April 1\n\nStirring up racial hatred by threatening, abusive, or insulting behavior was already illegal under Scotland\u2019s Public Order Act 1986, but the bill expands the law to other protected categories.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPontifical Gregorian University Announces Merger With Biblical, Eastern Institutes\n\nThe Gregorian currently has an enrollment of about 2,700 students, 70% of whom come from outside Italy.\n\n\nDaniel Payne/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome to the (St. Joseph) Table: Feasts Overflow With Food and Faith\n\nThe tradition originated in medieval Sicily about a thousand years ago.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chef Lauren Marchetti, With a Recipe for Meatloaf\n\n\u2018The mission is to bring peace and joy into the home,\u2019 she said.\n\n\nAlexandra Greeley\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A Purposeful Day\u2019: Helping Those With Down Syndrome Thrive Beyond the \u2018Cliff of Adulthood\u2019\n\nAs so many resources dwindle down as children with special needs grow older, Kate Ashbrook is working overtime to help young adults reach their potential.\n\n\nAlyssa Murphy\nCulture of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\nAfter her prodigious output in the early 1900s, Alice Guy moved to America and launched a movie studio in New Jersey.\n\n\nJames Day\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\nVatican Authorizes Opening of Cause for Canonization for 13-Year-Old Filipina Girl\n\n\nIreland\u2019s Snakes of Secularization\n\n\nPope Francis: God\u2019s Glory Does Not Correspond to Human Success\n\n\nIs \u2018Christian Nationalism\u2019 Really a Problem?\n\n\nBishop Barron on the Spiritual Crisis: Get In the Army of Christ\n\n\nSan Antonio Archbishop Bans Retreat Center for \u2018False Teachings\u2019 Against Pope Francis\n\n\nRiley Gaines, Other Female Athletes, Sue NCAA for Allowing Transgender Competitors\n\n\nWhat Was the Counter-Reformation?\n\n\nA Catholic School Named for St. Patrick That\u2019s Totally Free and Totally Faithful\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Social media \n\n Facebook\n\n Twitter\n\n Instagram\n\n Youtube\n\n\n\n\n Tools & Features \n\n E-Newsletters\n\n RSS Feeds\n\n Register News Widget\n\n Register Radio Podcast\n\n College Guide\n\n\n\n\n Print Subscriptions \n\n Subscribe\n\n Manage a Subscription\n\n Give a Subscription\n\n Order Bulk Subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n Marketplace \n\n Advertise\n\n Job Board\n\n EWTN Religious Catalogue\n\n\n\n\n More \n\n About Us\n\n Contact Us\n\n Support Us\n\n Archives\n\n Submissions\n\n Submit Letter to Editor\n\n Reprints and Permissions\n\n Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 EWTN News, Inc.
