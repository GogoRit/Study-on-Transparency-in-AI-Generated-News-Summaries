Washington D.C.'s\u00a0Metropolitan Police Department\u00a0(MPD) is pushing back on the way Students for Life of America (SFLA) has described events leading up to the arrest of two of its activists outside of a local\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0facility over the weekend.    SFLA said it applied for an event permit that included a request to paint \"Black Preborn\u00a0Lives Matter\" on the street outside of Planned Parenthood Whitehill Moses Center.\u00a0The organization claims that MPD granted them a permit to gather at Planned Parenthood and, in a separate conversation, verbally told them they would not be prevented from painting their\u00a0message on the street.MPD public affairs specialist Alaina Gertz\u00a0told Fox News\u00a0that the department\u00a0\"did not issue a permit to put a message on the street. MPD issues permits to assemble.\" Gertz\u00a0added\u00a0that the permit SFLA received explicitly stated that \u201cmarking or painting the street is not permitted.\u201d  ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST ACCUSES DC OF FIRST AMENDMENT VIOLATION AFTER ARREST FOR CHALKING PRO-LIFE SLOGAN  Additionally, Gertz said, the MPD didn't have \"any information to corroborate the statement that the group was told they would not be stopped from painting.\"  According to SFLA spokesperson Kristi Hamrick, both SFLA's permit request and a separate letter to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser\u00a0stated the group's intent was to paint on the street outside Planned Parenthood.SFLA declined to provide the permit to Fox News, stating that it was given to the organization's legal team. MPD directed Fox News to make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.  In a statement provided by Hamrick, the group claims it was told that the city, in MPD's words, opened a \"Pandora's box.\"\"SFLA\u2019s Executive Vice President\u00a0arranged for\u00a0the event permit from the Metropolitan Police for the event, and\u00a0she was told\u00a0verbally\u00a0that a 'Pandora\u2019s box'\u00a0had been opened regarding painting, that we would not be prevented from painting and to buy tempera paint,\" the group said.  'BABY LIVES MATTER' MURAL PAINTED IN FRONT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC    SFLA has said it intends intends to pursue legal action over the MPD's decision to arrest students for writing in chalk on the sidewalk -- something they insist happens every weekend outside of Planned Parenthood. In\u00a0video footage of the event, Warner DePriest, one of the arrested and an advisor with SFLA, can be heard saying,\u00a0\"We do this every Saturday.\"Video footage also shows police warning DePriest and SFLA student leader Erica Caporaletti that they would be arrested for defacing public property if they continued using sidewalk chalk. But SFLA claims that sidewalk chalk doesn't deface public property and that the city engaged in viewpoint discrimination since it allowed Black Lives Matter activists to paint \"Defund the Police\" on one of the city's streets.Activists painted \"Defund the Police\" in front of the \"Black Lives Matter\" slogan\u00a0so that it\u00a0read:\u00a0\"Black Lives Matter = Defund the Police.\" The initial painting of \"Black Lives Matter\" was permitted by Bowser.    According to NPR, the city's Department of Public Works was later seen refreshing some of the paint on the street, but didn't remove\u00a0\"defund the police.\"BLACK PRO-LIFE LEADERS PAN PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S SANGER DISAVOWAL: 'LIKE CHANGING THE NAME OF AUSCHWITZ'\"Well it\u2019s not a part of the mural,\" Bowser told ABC News in June.\u00a0\"And we certainly encourage expression but we are using the city streets for city art.\" When ABC's Martha Raddatz pressed her further, Bowser said she hadn't \"even had an opportunity to review it.\"  Bowser's office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
