Instead, the college graduate in her early 20s learned she was between 23 and 25 weeks pregnant. With California\u2019s cutoff set at about six months, she was turned away.\nAnn had been taking Depo-Provera, a birth control shot, every three months. But she had recently started a new job and delayed getting the next shot until her benefits kicked in. She gained some weight, but explained it away.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3The major cases still before the US Supreme Courtlist 2 of 3Religious freedom: The next battleground for US abortion rights?list 3 of 3Iowa Supreme Court clears path for state abortion banend of list\n\u201cI was told flat-out that there was no other option,\u201d Ann, whose name has been changed for privacy reasons, told Al Jazeera. \u201cI remember crying, gasping. It was such life-changing news that I was not expecting to get.\u201d\nWithout access to the abortion she wanted, she carried the pregnancy to term.\u00a0At eight months, she developed severe eclampsia, experienced seizures, and nearly died.\n\u201cI woke up three days later in the ICU,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up having an emergency c-section.\u201d\nOn Friday, the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade, the landmark decision issued nearly a half-century ago that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. Ann decided to share her story because she knows her experience is about to become more common.\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re going as a country with abortion access,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be more people like me.\u201d\nAbortion rights supporters and anti-abortion activists have been protesting outside the United States Supreme Court in recent weeks [File: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters]\nLife-threatening complications\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling removes the federal right allowing states to set their own abortion laws, with about half of US states expected to ban or restrict abortion in response. People in restricted states will either have to scramble to find abortion pills that can be used early in a pregnancy, or travel long distances \u2013 across state lines or international borders \u2013 to access the procedure.\nThose who cannot access abortion will be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. Experts say the bans and restrictions will most severely affect young, low-income people of colour, who already face barriers in accessing contraception and abortion.\nThe denial of abortion services can lead to serious potential harms for the affected women, including economic hardships, a higher likelihood of staying in contact with a violent partner, and more serious health problems, according to a study conducted at the University of California, San Francisco.\nTwo of the study participants died during childbirth after they were denied abortions because they were over the gestational limit of the facility where they sought care.\n\u201cThey were denied abortions because they showed up too late,\u201d Diana Greene Foster, a UCSF professor and lead author of the study, told Al Jazeera. \u201cOne died of eclampsia and the other one of an infection. Both of them were young, in their 20s, and one of them had kids before.\u201d\nThe denial of abortion services can lead to serious potential harms for the affected women, including economic hardships and more serious health problems, [File: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters]\nThe study, based on interviews conducted over a five-year period ending in 2016, followed 1,000 women from clinics in 21 states. Some received abortions and others were turned away, and the study chronicled the way their lives consequently diverged.\nWomen who were turned away and went on to give birth had an increase in household poverty. Years after being denied an abortion, they were more likely to not have enough money to pay for food, housing and transportation. They also had lower credit scores, higher debt, and an increased likelihood of bankruptcy and eviction.\nThe study also pointed to myriad health consequences for women who were denied abortions, from being more likely to stay with a violent father, to suffering life-threatening complications such as eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage. Black and Indigenous women face a heightened risk, with a mortality rate two to three times that of white women.\nThe children of mothers who were denied abortions were also negatively affected, both from a financial and a developmental perspective, the study found.\n\u201cWhen people receive an abortion, they set more aspirational plans for the future,\u201d Foster said, noting that access to abortion plays a clear role in whether people are able to achieve life goals, including deciding whether to have a child later under better circumstances.\n\u2018Range of negative outcomes\u2019\nWith the US entering a new era without a constitutionally enshrined right to abortion, Foster said she felt dread and despair. \u201cNobody knows yet,\u201d she said when asked what a post-Roe US would look like. \u201cWe\u2019re unfortunately about to see what happens.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that some people will carry unwanted pregnancies to term, and it will be the least advantaged who have to do that,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will see a deepening of economic inequality, where wealthy women and middle-class women scrape everything they have together to get an abortion somewhere else, and other people cannot.\u201d\nFoster said she was setting up another study to follow people affected by the outcome of the court decision.\nAccording to Elizabeth Nash, a state policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute, there are about 36 million women of reproductive age living in the 26 states that are now likely to ban or restrict abortion.\nA state policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute said there are about 36 million women of reproductive age living in the 26 states that are now likely to ban or restrict abortion [File: Jacquelyn Martin/AP]\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a light switch,\u201d Nash said of the state bans, which are expected to take effect in the hours, days, weeks and months after the ruling.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we may see more situations where people\u2019s life is at risk because they cannot access abortion care,\u201d Nash told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere are a range of negative outcomes that we will see as states ban abortions, because they are denying people the ability to make decisions about their lives and futures.\u201d\nThe court decision will also highlight the lack of US programmes and policies to support pregnant women, she added. At the local level, there are dozens of organisations that can help remove financial and logistical barriers to abortion for those living in restricted states.\nDespite nearly dying in childbirth and not being able to go to graduate school as she had planned, Ann believes she had among the best outcomes: She already had a college degree and a family that supported her financially, and she now has a high-paying job. She knows many people won\u2019t be so lucky.\n\u201cWe are going to be making a lot more women who have this version of motherhood that isn\u2019t really a choice; it\u2019s forced upon them,\u201d Ann said, encouraging others to speak out as well. \u201cI recommend that we do not go down quietly.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
