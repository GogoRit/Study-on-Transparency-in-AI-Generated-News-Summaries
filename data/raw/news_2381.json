Anthony (SBA) List, one of the country\u2019s most important pro-life organizations.\nTaylor, a Prattville businesswoman and attorney, is a candidate to succeed U.S. Rep. Martha Roby (AL-02).\nThe SBA list cited Taylor\u2019s previous service as president of River Region Pregnancy Resource Center, just outside of Montgomery, as a factor in the endorsement. She is also president of the Samaritan Counseling Center and strongly pledged to protect life in her viral campaign announcement video in the fall.\n\n\nAdditionally, Taylor began her career in the governor\u2019s Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, where she managed a high school dropout prevention program.\nIn a release, SBA List wrote, \u201cJessica Taylor (AL-02) hopes to succeed pro-life powerhouse Congresswoman Martha Roby. An Alabama native, former president of a pregnancy center, and mom-of-3, Jessica made a splash when she announced her run for Congress, promising to protect life. Her husband recently served as general counsel to Governor Kay Ivey, one of America\u2019s most pro-life governors.\u201d\nSBA List is a network of over 837,000 pro-life Americans from coast-to-coast. The organization is dedicated to ending abortion by electing national leaders and advocating for laws that save lives, with a special calling to promote pro-life female leaders.\nTaylor was featured in a round of eight endorsements announced Thursday, including two other members of the \u201cConservative Squad\u201d Taylor co-founded in December to go toe-to-toe with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-NY) \u201cSocialist Squad.\u201d\n\u201cWe are proud to endorse these eight exceptional pro-life women candidates,\u201d stated Marilyn Musgrave, SBA List vice president of government affairs. \u201cWith a special calling to promote women who will protect the unborn, SBA List stands behind this first group of endorsed candidates\u2026 We are confident that all of these women will provide invaluable perspectives and strong leadership to protect unborn life, and we look forward to seeing them in Washington.\u201d\nTaylor has signed a term limits pledge this campaign cycle and has already been endorsed by State Rep. Will Dismukes (R-Prattville) and conservative groups such as VIEW PAC and Winning for Women.\nThe GOP primary field to succeed Roby is crowded and includes Wiregrass businessman Jeff Coleman, former Alabama Attorney General Troy King and former State Rep. Barry Moore (R-Enterprise).\nUpdate 12:00 P.M.:\nTaylor released a statement following the endorsement announcement.\n\u201cThe Right to Life is fundamental and must be cherished and protected,\u201dshe said. \u201cAs a mother of three, and the former President of the Board at my local pregnancy center, this is a very personal issue for me. It is critical that we always give a voice to and fight for the rights of the unborn. As your Congresswoman, I will be a leader in supporting our pro-life mission in Congress. I will always be a steadfast and unapologetic supporter of the unborn, stand against the radical pro-abortion Democrats, and vote to defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\u201cI am humbled by the support of Susan B. Anthony List, and I welcome all pro-life supporters to our cause,\u201d Taylor concluded.\nSBA\u2019s Musgrave also made a statement specifically on Taylor.\n\u201cWe are proud to support Jessica Taylor as she brings her strong community leadership skills to Washington \u2013 she is ready to serve Alabamians in Congress,\u201d Musgrave commented. \u201cJessica has worked on the front lines of the fight to protect women and children as the president of a pro-life pregnancy center. She knows the joy of helping women choose life and will stand up to the ruthless abortion industry for women everywhere.\u201d\nSean Ross is the editor of Yellowhammer News.
