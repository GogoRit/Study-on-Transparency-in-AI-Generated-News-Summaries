It is shameful that the Trump Administration is spending its last days attacking reproductive health care instead of addressing the COVID-19 crisis. \nThis action is just the latest in a four year attempt by the Trump-Pence administration to push abortion care out of reach, and the impact falls hardest on those working to make ends meet as the pandemic continues to rage. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage communities of color, especially Black, Brown, and Indigenous people who are dying at disproportionately higher rates\u2014the same communities that are most harmed by barriers to abortion access.\nCalifornia\u2019s policy, based on decades of California law, embodies three important concepts that have all but disappeared with the erosion of abortion rights:\nAbortion is basic health care.\nA pregnant person has two medical options: childbirth or abortion. Abortion is a safe medical procedure\u2014indeed, safer than childbirth at every stage of gestation. The risk of death associated with childbirth is approximately\u00a014 times higher\u00a0than that with abortion. One in four women will have an abortion by age 45.[1] \u00a0\u00a0\nAbortion is a constitutionally protected personal decision.\u00a0\nIn California, our Constitution and our Reproductive Privacy Act guarantee that each of us has the right to decide about our own pregnancy. It\u2019s not the boss\u2019s business, it\u2019s not the insurance company\u2019s business, and it\u2019s not the government\u2019s business. Abortion and prenatal care must be treated equally.\nRestricting abortion coverage is discrimination.\u00a0\nControl over reproduction is fundamental to a person\u2019s ability to participate in social, economic and political life. Discriminatory policies (covering all prenatal care but only certain abortions) reinforce the archaic message that a cisgender woman\u2019s proper role is motherhood\u2014and, even then, on the state\u2019s terms, not hers.\nCalifornia\u2019s abortion coverage requirement conveys simple truths that have become obscured in the political effort to stigmatize abortion: childbearing is a personal decision, abortion is basic health care, and control of reproduction is critical to autonomy.\nHHS, an agency that is supposed to protect patients\u2019 rights, should respect and support these truths instead of acting as a political weapon for abortion opponents. In California, we will continue fighting to expand, not restrict, access to abortion and other reproductive health care.\nArneta Rogers is the Gender Sexuality and Reproductive Justice Director at the ACLU of Northern California.\nElizabeth Gill is a Staff Attorney at the ACLU of Northern California.\n[1] This research uses the term \u201cwomen,\u201d which we replicate here. Transgender men and nonbinary individuals similarly need access to insurance coverage for abortion, and they face particular barriers in accessing abortion care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Become a Member\n\n\n\nReal change starts with you \u2013 and every one of us can help make a difference.\n\n\n                    Join Us\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Informed\nSign up for ACLU updates\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Postal Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLUNC Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nWho We Are\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nBoards of Directors\n\n\nWork with Us\n\n\nFinancials & Reports\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\n\n\nOur Work\n\n\nKnow Your Rights\n\n\nLegislation\n\n\nLegal Docket\n\n\nNeed Legal Help?\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nPress Releases\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\n\n\nActions\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nChapters\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\nEstate Plan Gifts\n\n\nGifts of Stock\n\n\nTribute Gifts\n\n\nMembership\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\u00a0(415) 621-2493\u00a0(press@aclunc.org) | User Agreement | Privacy Statement | Fraud Alert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Navigation -- Offcanvas\n\n\nWho We Are\n\nShow submenu\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nContract Opportunities\n\n\nInternships\n\n\nVolunteering\n\n\nFinancial Reports\n\n\nUser Agreement\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\n\nShow submenu\n\n\n\n\nLegislation\n\n\nLegal Docket\n\n\nCriminal Justice\n\n\nDemocratic & Civic Engagement\n\n\nGender, Sexuality & Reproductive Justice\n\n\nImmigrants' Rights\n\n\nRacial & Economic Justice\n\n\nTechnology & Civil Liberties\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nShow submenu\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nPress Releases\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\n\nShow submenu\n\n\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nChapters\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\nShow submenu\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\nEstate Plan Gifts\n\n\nTribute Gifts\n\n\nGifts of Stock\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\nKnow Your Rights\n\nShow submenu\n\n\n\n\nPolice Interactions for Black and Brown People\n\n\nYour Right to Demonstrate\n\n\nPolice Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nNeed Legal Help?\n\n\nContact\n\n\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
