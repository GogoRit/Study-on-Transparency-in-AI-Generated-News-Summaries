While the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act of 2019 and the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act of 2019 promise to expand abortion access at a federal level, the real battle over abortion\u2014and who can access it\u2014plays out on the state level.\u00a0\n\u201cThese bans introduce additional financial hardship because those who need an abortion later in pregnancy now have to travel to different states.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Southern states have highly limited access to abortion. Some of the nation\u2019s most regressive bills, such as six-week bans, fetal remains burial laws, and judicial bypass, are commonplace.\nWhile many of these bills are unenforceable due to their unconstitutionality, they are nonetheless extremely dangerous. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, a total of twenty-four states and territories in the United States have laws or provisions written into their state constitutions that would automatically ban abortion if the federal right to abortion were to fall. In essence, if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned\u2014a likely scenario given the extremely conservative makeup of the Supreme Court\u2014almost every state in the U.S. South would outlaw abortion outright.\u00a0\nExcept for one: Florida.\nNot many people see Florida as a bastion of reproductive freedom. Despite a history of conservative politicians and current hostility toward abortion, the state actually has no trigger laws or Constitutional abortion bans in place. If Roe falls, pregnant people from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and likely the Carolinas will make their way to Florida to access abortion care.\nIt would be disastrous, then, for politicians to undermine the potential safety that Florida offers pregnant people by making the procedure even harder to access today. There are currently a slew of laws already on the books that make abortion difficult to access. According to the Guttmacher Institute, these include regulations that:\u00a0\nRequire patients to receive biased state-mandated counseling designed to discourage them from obtaining an abortion.\nBar the use of the state\u2019s public insurance to cover the cost of an abortion unless their life is in danger.\nRequire that minors notify their parents or guardians of their procedure unless they obtain a judicial bypass.\nMandate a medically unnecessary ultrasound and make doctors explicitly ask patients if they would like to view it.\nBan all abortions after twenty-four-weeks.\u00a0\n\nThe overwhelming number of regulations\u00a0hasn\u2019t stopped Republican lawmakers from attempting to add more.\u00a0\nFor instance, Florida Senate Bill 744/House Bill 351, officially titled \u201cProtection of a Pain-capable Unborn Child from Abortion,\u201d unilaterally prevents anyone from obtaining an abortion on or after the twentieth week of pregnancy.\u00a0\nDespite there being no conclusive evidence that fetuses can feel pain at any point during pregnancy, this bill is intentionally meant to deceive unaware people into thinking that fetuses are more important than the actual pregnant person.\u00a0\nThese politicians do not care about fetal pain. They certainly don\u2019t care about the pain of their living, breathing constituents who are minors, 55 percent of whom are living in poverty, compared 14.4 percent of all children nationally. This bill is just another way that anti-abortion lawmakers are trying to control the lives and futures of pregnant people.\u00a0\n\u201cOur callers are reaching out to us because they are facing a barrier to abortion access,\u201d says Kris Lawler, intake volunteer and board member of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. Despite the ability of states to pass laws until the burden on the patient becomes undue, Lawler isn\u2019t buying that these bans aren\u2019t exactly that. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be an undue burden, but every single person we talk to is facing some type of hurdle or burden. These bans, on top of what they are already facing, are undue.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAmber Gavin, an employee of A Woman\u2019s Choice, an independent clinic in Florida, is already familiar with the effects of a twenty-week ban because of one of the clinic\u2019s other locations in North Carolina, where there is a nineteen-week ban in place.\u00a0\n\u201cThe majority of all abortions across the country are done earlier in pregnancy,\u201d Gavin says, \u201cbut bans like this actually delay care. They don\u2019t delay people needing that care. These bans introduce additional financial hardship because those who need an abortion later in pregnancy now have to travel to different states.\u201d\nThis means, she explains, \u201cmultiple days off from work, child care (because most people who are seeking an abortion already have children), the costs of hotels and flights. And, of course, the further along in pregnancy the person is, the more the procedure will cost.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Guttmacher Institute found that if this bill is passed, \u201cthe average one-way driving distance for a Florida woman of reproductive age to a clinic that could provide abortion care at or after twenty weeks would increase from fourteen miles to 469 miles\u2014more than thirty times as far. Put another way, that would be a nearly eight-hour road trip each way on average, if driving nonstop at sixty miles per hour.\u201d\nAnother Florida bill being considered is SB 1664/HB 1221, which would outlaw all abortions on the basis of the disability of the fetus.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t be fooled: Republicans in office pushing these bills only care about disabled people before they\u2019re born. When the living disabled community requires health care, aid, and accommodations, those same Republicans are nowhere to be found.\u00a0\nAnother bill is particularly grotesque. House Bill 1437 would require people to choose to either cremate or bury the remains of the pregnancy, or else they or the abortion provider will face punishments.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is such a waste of time for our elected officials to focus yet again on banning abortion,\u201d said U.S. Representative Val Demings of Florida in a local town hall. \u201cI fully support a woman\u2019s right to choose. My gosh, can\u2019t we get over this and focus on the things that really help to improve the quality of life for people who are suffering in this country?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd Florida isn\u2019t the only state mulling new anti-abortion laws. Five states have enacted laws preventing abortion based on fetal anomalies. Dozens of states have tried to introduce twenty-week abortion bans based on the false notion that fetuses can feel pain after that time, and it\u2019s even been introduced as HR 36 in the U.S. House of Representatives.\u00a0\nElected representatives in these and other states need to hear from their constituents who want to protect access to safe and legal abortion.\n\n\nBack to Search Results\n\nTags\nWomen's Health\nWomen's Rights\nHealth\nFlorida\nReproductive Rights\nHealthcare\nSteph Black\nDispatches\nPublic Health\nAbortion\nGender Equity\nWomen's History\nReproductive justice\nRoe v.
