(photo: Courtesy photo / Archdiocese of St. Louis)\n\n\nKate Olivera/CNA\nNation\nJanuary 31, 2022\n\n\nST. LOUIS, Mo. \u2014 Tucked away near the Forest Park neighborhood of St. Louis is a brick, three-story convent dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe. The convent, situated in a converted home on a corner lot, is nothing spectacular to the unknowing eye. \u00a0\nBut the convent is unique because it is located directly across the street from a Planned Parenthood facility, the last facility in Missouri that performs surgical abortions.\u00a0\nThe location is intentional, and those involved with the convent say abortions at the neighboring facility have dramatically decreased since the convent\u2019s dedication in 2017.\n\u201cAbortions have significantly decreased in that facility and in Missouri overall, since the opening of the convent,\u201d said Amy Kosta, program manager at the convent. \u201cHow can that evil happen with Jesus right across the street?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea for Our Lady of Guadalupe Convent originated in 2015 when a few Catholic couples in the Archdiocese of Saint Louis proposed building a chapel near the Planned Parenthood facility. The chapel could be a place for pro-life advocates and sidewalk counselors to gather for prayer and fellowship.\u00a0\nThey brought their idea to the then-Archbishop Robert Carlson, who has since retired. The archdiocese purchased and renovated the house, dedicating it in 2017 as a convent under the patronage of the protectress of the unborn, Our Lady of Guadalupe.\u00a0\nThe convent is operated by the Respect Life apostolate within the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. But the daily task of welcoming sidewalk counselors and other pro-life advocates is the responsibility of the two Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity who live there: Sisters Sue Ann Hall and Delores Vogt.\u00a0\n\u201cPeople always say, \u2018what do you do all day?\u2019 And I say, \u2018answer the doorbell.\u2019 The doorbell dictates what we do or what's going on,\u201d said Sister Hall.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe convent has a dual ministry of prayer and hospitality. It serves as a safe haven for pro-life advocates. Sidewalk counselors can come to the convent to warm themselves when there is cold weather. Those who are too intimidated to pray from the sidewalk outside of Planned Parenthood can find a quiet space in the convent\u2019s chapel.\u00a0\n\u201cWe try to say too if there's somebody that is afraid to come and pray in front of Planned Parenthood, they can always come to our chapel,\u201d Sister Hall said. \u201cThe chapel is always there. The prayer reaches there as well as out on the sidewalk.\u201d\nThe convent also hosts adoration, Mass, and lunches several times a month. A meeting room on the third floor frequently accommodates the meetings of pro-life ministries in the archdiocese. The convent will also host rallies and special events surrounding national pro-life advancements, including the recent Supreme Court hearings in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a case out of Mississippi that has the potential to overturn nationwide legalized abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cWe had people on the sidewalk, people praying in front of the blessed sacrament and then we also had people in fellowship,\u201d Kosta said. \u201cSo it was kind of just a revolving door that day, at least in front of our facility.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2018s a safe place, it\u2019s a comfortable place and it's just so welcoming,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd the sisters are just a joy to work with.\u201d\nKosta is fairly new to her role at the convent, but she was aware of the convent and its ministry well before she took the job. She has two children who have volunteered as sidewalk counselors outside the Planned Parenthood facility across the street from the convent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a place that a lot of people wanna go, especially by themselves,\u201d she said, adding that the facility is located in a semi-industrial area on the edge of a neighborhood. \u201cWhen the convent was established, I was thrilled because I had a young daughter in her early twenties standing outside of Planned Parenthood counseling with nowhere to go as a safe place.\u201d\nBefore the convent, sidewalk counselors would frequently walk to a nearby restaurant if they needed a bathroom. Now, they can walk across the street for a bathroom, a chapel and \u2014 \u00a0if they are lucky \u2014 the sisters\u2019 chocolate chip cookies. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMany times the sisters will be reintroduced to pro-life advocates at other events in the archdiocese, \u201cand they\u2018ll say, \u2018I remember those chocolate chip cookies\u2019,\u201d Sister Hall said. \u201cSo in a sense it\u2019s an icebreaker to get to know people and it encourages them to maybe want to come back again. If nothing else for a chocolate chip cookie and a Hail Mary.\u201d\nThe convent and its pro-life ministry are catching the attention of other dioceses. Kosta said a couple from a neighboring archdiocese visited the convent recently and hoped to launch something similar in their own area.\u00a0\nKosta has yet to interact herself with any employees of the abortion facility across the street, but she said she\u2019s certain they\u2019re aware of the convent and its ministry.\u00a0\n\u201cThey have to be aware of what\u2018s going on,\u201d Kosta said. \u201cThere are icons in the windows, the sisters have a bird\u2019s eye view of what\u2018s going on in the parking lot. They can contact us and say, \u2018Hey, the abortionist is here today.\u2019 Or, you know, \u2018there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of activity going on right now, but this day is when I see activity.\u2019 So we can try to bring more people to pray on those specific days.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKosta said there has been a noticeable decrease in the number of surgical abortions performed at the Planned Parenthood facility since the convent opened.\u00a0\nUnfortunately Planned Parenthood opened a large facility just across the Mississippi River in Illinois. Kosta said the Planned Parenthood by the convent will often refer women to that abortion facility.\u00a0\nShe said it is also difficult to track how many chemical abortions the facility is providing.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the one thing that we maybe don\u2018t have a complete handle on \u2014 and I may be wrong \u2014 but there are a lot of chemical abortions happening,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the abortion pill\u2026That\u2019s kind of the newest trend because people are able to get that in the mail.\u201d\nSome days, the sisters join pro-life advocates in praying from the sidewalk outside the Planned Parenthood. The sisters said passing cars will often honk in support, but they will also get negative comments.\n\u201cIn one sense, there\u2018s a sense of \u2018are we safe? Is it safe to be here? Will something happen?\u2019,\u201d Sister Hall said. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve been very blessed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026feel this sense of God enveloping us and knowing we're here for good and for His honor and glory,\u201d Sister Hall continued.\u00a0\n\u201cI just feel if God wants this work to be accomplished that He will see it accomplished. Why fear when He tells you not to be afraid?\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nst. louis\nabortion\npro-life groups\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetired St. Louis Priest Gets Prison Time for Child-Pornography Charges\n\nA retired Vincentian priest who ministered in St. Louis until 2021 was sentenced this week to five years in prison, after admitting in October to possessing thousands of images containing child pornography.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEEK23 Speakers Remember Pope Benedict XVI on the Day of His Burial\n\nArchbishop Mitchell Rozanski of St. Louis, the celebrant at the conference\u2019s opening Mass on Jan. 2, asked those in attendance to dedicate the week to praying for the late Pope\u2019s soul.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Louis Hopes FOCUS Conference Will Spark Catholic Renewal in the \u2018Rome of the West\u2019\n\nFather Schmitz will return as a keynote speaker in January.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissouri Attorney General May Sue Kansas City Over Aid for Out-of-State Abortions\n\nOn July 1, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said he plans to sue, saying the city\u2019s plan amounts to a use of taxpayer funds for abortions, which is prohibited under state law.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland\u2019s Controversial New Hate Crime Law Set to Come Into Effect April 1\n\nStirring up racial hatred by threatening, abusive, or insulting behavior was already illegal under Scotland\u2019s Public Order Act 1986, but the bill expands the law to other protected categories.\n\n\nJonah McKeown/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPontifical Gregorian University Announces Merger With Biblical, Eastern Institutes\n\nThe Gregorian currently has an enrollment of about 2,700 students, 70% of whom come from outside Italy.\n\n\nDaniel Payne/CNA\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome to the (St. Joseph) Table: Feasts Overflow With Food and Faith\n\nThe tradition originated in medieval Sicily about a thousand years ago.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Special Favors You Can Receive When You \u2018Go to St. Joseph\u2019\n\nThe Solemnity of St. Joseph is a perfect time to learn from two great mystics why his intercession is so powerful.\n\n\nJoseph Pronechen\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chef Lauren Marchetti, With a Recipe for Meatloaf\n\n\u2018The mission is to bring peace and joy into the home,\u2019 she said.\n\n\nAlexandra Greeley\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A Purposeful Day\u2019: Helping Those With Down Syndrome Thrive Beyond the \u2018Cliff of Adulthood\u2019\n\nAs so many resources dwindle down as children with special needs grow older, Kate Ashbrook is working overtime to help young adults reach their potential.\n\n\nAlyssa Murphy\nCulture of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\nAfter her prodigious output in the early 1900s, Alice Guy moved to America and launched a movie studio in New Jersey.\n\n\nJames Day\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\nVatican Authorizes Opening of Cause for Canonization for 13-Year-Old Filipina Girl\n\n\nIreland\u2019s Snakes of Secularization\n\n\nPope Francis: God\u2019s Glory Does Not Correspond to Human Success\n\n\nIs \u2018Christian Nationalism\u2019 Really a Problem?\n\n\nBishop Barron on the Spiritual Crisis: Get In the Army of Christ\n\n\nSan Antonio Archbishop Bans Retreat Center for \u2018False Teachings\u2019 Against Pope Francis\n\n\nRiley Gaines, Other Female Athletes, Sue NCAA for Allowing Transgender Competitors\n\n\nWhat Was the Counter-Reformation?\n\n\nA Catholic School Named for St. Patrick That\u2019s Totally Free and Totally Faithful\n\n\nAlice Guy: The Catholic Pioneer Filmmaker You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Social media \n\n Facebook\n\n Twitter\n\n Instagram\n\n Youtube\n\n\n\n\n Tools & Features \n\n E-Newsletters\n\n RSS Feeds\n\n Register News Widget\n\n Register Radio Podcast\n\n College Guide\n\n\n\n\n Print Subscriptions \n\n Subscribe\n\n Manage a Subscription\n\n Give a Subscription\n\n Order Bulk Subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n Marketplace \n\n Advertise\n\n Job Board\n\n EWTN Religious Catalogue\n\n\n\n\n More \n\n About Us\n\n Contact Us\n\n Support Us\n\n Archives\n\n Submissions\n\n Submit Letter to Editor\n\n Reprints and Permissions\n\n Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 EWTN News, Inc.
