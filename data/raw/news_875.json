With one exception as soon as the law went into effect, abortion providers in Texas have stopped performing these prohibited procedures \u2014 so opponents haven\u2019t tried to bring one of these enforcement suits.\nBut that could be changing. A group of anti-abortion lawyers have taken steps to potentially bring lawsuits under SB 8, claiming in state court petitions that the leaders of two abortion funds have information about illegal abortions they helped patients procure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a significant escalation on the part of abortion opponents, who have so far seemed satisfied with the chilling effect that even just the threat of lawsuits has had on abortion providers and their affiliates.\nThe petitions were filed by two women, Ashley Maxwell of Hood County and Sadie Weldon of Jack County. They are represented by Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of SB 8 and a former solicitor general for Texas; state Sen. Bryan Hughes (R-Mineola), the law\u2019s chief legislative advocate; and lawyers from the right-wing Thomas More Society and America First Legal Foundation.\nMaxwell and Weldon are asking a judge to allow them to depose the executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund and the deputy director of the Lilith Fund before any lawsuits are filed.\nIf granted, the depositions will allow the petitioners to discover \u201cthe extent of involvement of each individual that aided or abetted post-heartbeat abortions in violation of SB 8\u201d so they can \u201cbetter evaluate the prospects for legal success.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile abortion providers have reported significant declines in patient loads since the law went into effect, abortion funds have seen a surge in demand from clients trying to access abortions before the deadline or leave the state to seek the procedure.\n\u201cWhat [these petitions] mean to do is chill pregnant people from seeking out the help of abortion funds,\u201d said Elizabeth Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIf someone thinks that their identity and circumstances are going to be revealed to the world at large by a lawsuit \u2026 they\u2019re going to hesitate before they pick up the phone and call for help.\u201d\n\u201cAided and abetted\u201d\nThe petitions seek to depose Kamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, and Neesha Dav\u00e9, deputy director of the Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, two nonprofit abortion funds that provide financial assistance to patients seeking abortions.\nConner and Dav\u00e9 both admitted, in sworn affidavits in state court, that their organizations helped fund abortions \u201cafter the period in which cardiac activity is usually detectable.\u201d That would put them in violation of SB 8, also known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, and open them up to potential lawsuits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizations helped fund these abortions during a brief period last fall in which a federal district judge had enjoined the law from being enforced. A higher court quickly overturned that ruling; SB 8 specifically notes that an injunction that is later overturned is not a protection from future lawsuits.\nThat aspect of the law hasn\u2019t been tested in court, and experts say it\u2019s unclear whether it would hold up.\n\u201cIn part, this attempt to get a deposition is also an attempt to figure out if claims can be brought based on the abortions performed in those few days where SB 8 was not in effect,\u201d said Sepper.\nThe depositions are also seeking to identify who, in the language of the law, \u201caided and abetted\u201d in these abortions \u2014 and the petitions indicate they\u2019re taking a very wide view of that term. According to the filing, they\u2019re seeking information on the funds\u2019 role in facilitating abortions, the identity of individuals that they collaborated with and access to documents on the funds\u2019 sources of financial support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Thomas More Society President Tom Brejcha said the two named abortions funds have \u201cexposed their employees, volunteers and donors to civil lawsuits and potential criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\u201cThose who are funding or assisting in bringing about these abortions will be revealed in discovery,\u201d Brejcha said. \u201cAnyone who has aided or abetted an illegal abortion in Texas is subject to the full force of the law and imposition of these civil and criminal sanctions.\u201d\nIn response to a fundraising callout by the Lilith Fund, the Thomas More Society tweeted a warning, \u201c@lilithfund donors could get sued under SB 8,\u201d and linked to the press release about the petitions.\nIs this a standalone case?\nLawyers for the abortion funds and lawyers for the petitioners disagree on how \u2014 and where \u2014 these deposition requests should proceed. The conflict centers on the ongoing \u201cmultidistrict litigation,\u201d where 14 challenges to the law in state court were combined into one courtroom in Austin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese cases specifically targeted the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life and its legislative director, John Seago, and were heard by retired state magistrate judge David Peeples. It was as part of this multidistrict litigation that Conner and Dav\u00e9 filed these sworn affidavits, admitting to potential violations of SB8.\nIn December, Peeples ruled that SB8 was unconstitutional, though he didn\u2019t enjoin it from being enforced. Texas Right to Life has appealed that decision, and all other actions in the case are halted while that appeal proceeds.\nThe central question is whether these petitions seeking to depose Conner and Dav\u00e9 are related to that case and should be added to the multidistrict litigation. If they are, they too would be stayed from moving forward by the ongoing appeal, and the depositions wouldn\u2019t happen anytime soon.\nJennifer Ecklund and Elizabeth Myers, who are representing the abortion funds, consider these new petitions to be \u201ctag-along\u201d cases \u2014 the actual legal term \u2014 and have moved them into the multidistrict litigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell, representing both Texas Right to Life and the women who filed the petitions, has filed a motion arguing that these petitions are not related to the ongoing litigation and should be sent back to Jack and Denton counties, where the cases are filed.\nSeago, with Texas Right to Life, said that he was not consulted by Mitchell or anyone else before these petitions were filed and has no part in this effort. Mitchell declined to comment; Hughes did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe next step would be for Peeples to hold a hearing and decide whether or not the cases are related. Lawyers for the abortion funds argue that the stay in the multidistrict case blocks Peeples from even taking that step, a stance that will likely be challenged by the lawyers for the petitioners.\nDisclosure: University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
