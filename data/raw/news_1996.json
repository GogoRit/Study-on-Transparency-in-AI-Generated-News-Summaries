(AP) \u2014 South Carolina Republicans are pushing new abortion restrictions in a late attempt to curtail access after a near-total ban failed last month.A Senate bill that would ban abortion except in the earliest weeks of pregnancy is moving quickly through the South Carolina House in the first sign that Republican leaders may be close to restoring limits passed in 2021 but overturned by the state Supreme Court.The effort cleared two hurdles Tuesday. Lawmakers advanced the proposal through a morning subcommittee meeting with one hour of public comment and a full committee meeting lasting over three hours.The measure would ban abortion when an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, around six weeks and before most people know they are pregnant. It includes exceptions for fatal fetal anomaly, rape, incest, and the patient\u2019s life and health up to 12 weeks. Doctors could face felony charges carrying a $10,000 fine and two years of imprisonment for violations.\n\nBut the House committee voted Tuesday to insert many provisions from the chamber\u2019s failed near-total ban. The bill now outlines specific medical conditions like ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages in a list of exceptions to the ban. It also requires that fathers pay retroactive child support starting at conception and cover half of all medical expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Majority Leader David Hiott said Senate negotiators have approved the changes. But a second Senate passage is not guaranteed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move comes two weeks after the only five women in the South Carolina Senate filibustered a House bill banning nearly all abortions, and six Republicans helped defeat any chance it becomes law this year.Two of the three Republican women attended the Tuesday morning deliberations. All three told The Associated Press they don\u2019t support any changes.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to put everything in the kitchen sink with this thing,\u201d State Sen. Penry Gustafson said. \u201cLet\u2019s get it across the finish line so we can reduce abortions.\u201d\n\nShe said House Republicans should have passed the original Senate bill earlier this year.State Sen. Sandy Senn said she did not expect the new version would pass the Senate, but she added that \u201ccrazier things have happened.\u201d\u201cWe had told them if you want it to pass, don\u2019t move a semicolon,\u201d said Senn, who voted against the bill in February. \u201cThey were very, very substantive changes. So, yes, we will be filibustering.\u201dThe bill now faces a full House vote before returning to the Senate. The session is scheduled to end May 11. But Republican Gov. Henry McMaster has said he will exercise his power to call lawmakers back next week if they do not fulfill a number of GOP priorities.Abortion remains legal through 22 weeks of pregnancy in South Carolina. The conservative General Assembly has been unable to reach agreement over when to ban abortion after the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled 3-2 this January that a 2021 ban when cardiac activity is detected violated the state\u2019s right to privacy.Republican leaders hope new restrictions will withstand legal scrutiny after they tweaked the measure\u2019s language and voted this February on a new state Supreme Court justice.\n\nAn all-male bench would hear any challenge that reaches the state\u2019s highest court. Justice Gary Hill replaced the lone female justice, Kaye Hearn, who had reached the mandatory retirement age and who authored the lead opinion in the abortion decision.Republican state Rep. Jay Jordan emphasized Tuesday that the justices sent the ball \u201cback in our court\u201d to craft a new law for their consideration.Democratic state Rep. Spencer Wetmore accused her colleagues of also recrafting the South Carolina Supreme Court. Jordan responded that all courts change membership.The committee\u2019s debate lasted late into the evening as Republicans defeated attempts to expand Medicaid coverage or reduce the penalty for doctors. Democrats said threatening medical professionals with felony prosecution would drive them away from a state where 15 counties already have no OB-GYN.\n\nAnother failed amendment would have expanded exceptions for \u201csevere fetal anomaly\u201d and not just \u201cfatal fetal anomaly.\u201dA Charleston woman had testified that hospital lawyers determined a complicated health defect discovered last July at her 18-week anatomy scan did not count as a \u201cfatal fetal anomaly.\u201d Jill Hartle said lawmakers\u2019 restrictions added to the stress of an \u201cexcruciating decision\u201d by forcing her to get abortion care in Washington, D.C.\u201cIf these bans continue to be placed, this is the utmost breach of privacy any government could impose,\u201d Hartle said. \u201cThe Republican Party that I used to align with wanted less government. But these bills are total control.\u201d\u2014-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
