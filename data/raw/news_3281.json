The August 2 referendum represents the first major statewide vote on abortion following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\nThe survey, conducted by co/efficient and shared by FiveThirtyEight, found that 47% of likely primary voters in Kansas say they plan to vote for the pro-life amendment, 43% say they plan to vote against it, and 10% are undecided.\nThe amendment needs a simple majority of 51% to pass.\nThe poll surveyed 1,557 likely Kansas primary voters from July 17-18 through mobile text response and automated landline interviews. It has a margin of error of +/- 2.78%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas citizens will vote on the pro-life amendment, also known as the \u201cValue Them Both\u201d amendment, during their state\u2019s primary election. The amendment would reverse the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 ruling that the state\u2019s constitution protects a woman\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to abortion.\u00a0\nCurrently, state lawmakers are, in most cases, prohibited from passing any type of abortion restriction. The amendment, if approved by voters, would enable state lawmakers to pass legislation to regulate or restrict abortion.\nThe vote will have broad implications that extend past Kansas\u2019 borders. It could indicate how other states will vote on abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson \u2014 which overturned Roe and left abortion policy up to the states \u2014 and suggest where Americans stand on abortion ahead of the midterm elections in November.\nIt could also determine whether Kansas serves as an abortion hub for women in neighboring states that restrict abortion.\u00a0\nMackenzie Haddix, the deputy communications director for the Value Them Both Coalition, applauded the poll\u2019s findings. The coalition in support of the amendment is led by Kansans for Life, the Kansas Catholic Conference, and Kansas Family Voice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged because we know Kansans do not support the radical pro-abortion agenda of the left,\u201d Haddix told CNA. \u201cThese poll results are further evidence that voters reject a future that includes a 1,000% increase in abortions paid for with our tax dollars and understand Value Them Both must be passed to avoid this increase.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, abortions could increase by more than 1,000% in Kansas as neighboring states restrict the procedure, the Kansas City Star previously reported.\u00a0\u00a0\nArchbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City in Kansas, the former chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 pro-life committee, also responded positively to the findings.\n\u201cI am encouraged that according to the poll more Kansans support the passage of Value Them Both than oppose it, despite the avalanche of deceptive advertising funded by the abortion industry that attempts to confuse voters,\u201d he told CNA.\u00a0\u201cThis is a tribute to the prayers and hard work of the many dedicated Value Them Both volunteers.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new poll breaks down the results by political party and finds that, of Republican likely primary voters in Kansas, 68% plan to vote yes to the amendment, 18% plan to vote no, and 14% are undecided. Of Democrats, 10% plan to vote yes, 86% plan to vote no, and 4% are undecided.\nKansas likely voters also chose which statements best reflected their understanding of the amendment. Thirty-one percent said it will allow Kansas to ban abortion, 30% said it clarifies that there is no right to an abortion in the Kansas Constitution, and 31% said it protects women's healthcare by ensuring that the state can create guidelines for abortion.\nRyan Munce, president of co/efficient, explained the reasoning behind the three options.\n\u201cAfter reviewing the messaging and narratives of the media and campaigns both for and against the amendment, we came up with those three \u2018buckets\u2019 of interpretation,\u201d Munce told CNA. \u201cWe thought that would give us a good read of how the messaging is working, and how perception is being shaped about the amendment.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis appoints new bishop to lead Wisconsin diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nHe called it \u201ccertainly surprising\u201d that the data came back with all three statements receiving an almost identical share of the electorate.\n\u201cDemocrats are three times as likely to believe that the amendment is intended to create an outright ban on abortion in the state, than Republicans,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhile a strong majority of Republicans interpret the amendment in a different way.\u201d\nHaddix said of the various options: \u201cI would just reiterate that the amendment is not a ban on abortion, but rather allows us to restore commonsense limits on the abortion industry that Kansans already agree on.\u201d\nAs the spokesperson for the coalition working to oppose the amendment, Ashley All of Kansans for Constitutional Freedom accused the amendment\u2019s supporters of wanting to \u201cultimately ban abortion completely with no exceptions.\u201d\nShe responded to CNA about the poll\u2019s findings by predicting a \u201cclose race.\u201d She regretted that the vote will take place during the primary election instead of the general election in November, claiming that the amendment\u2019s backers \u201chope fewer Kansans vote.\u201d\u00a0\nOf the likely voters, 86% said they were familiar with the \"Value Them Both\" constitutional amendment that will be on the ballot August 2. Only 7% said they were not.\nA large majority (84%) said that the amendment increased the importance of voting in this upcoming election, including 78% of Republicans and 94% of Democrats.\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nNaumann stressed to CNA that \u201cthe only poll that really matters is the decision of Kansas voters from now to August 2nd.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cI encourage every Pro-Life Kansan from every corner of the State to vote YES in favor of the Value Them Both Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fate of Value Them Both will be decided by those who show up on election day.\u201d\nKansas voters on abortion and Roe v. Wade\nOf likely Kansas primary voters, the co/efficient poll found that 49% agreed with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, while 46% disagreed.\nA plurality of Kansas voters (33%) said that there should be no government restrictions on abortion, while 9% said abortion should be banned under any circumstance.In the middle, 24% said abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, while 14% said non-medically necessary abortion in Kansas should be legal but not past viability of the fetus. Ten percent said abortion should only be legal to save the life of the mother. And 7% said non-medically necessary abortion in Kansas should be legal but not after a heartbeat is detected.\nEditor's note: This story was updated on July 22 to reflect co/efficient's adjusted poll numbers regarding likely Kansas primary voters' positions on abortion.\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nRoe v.
