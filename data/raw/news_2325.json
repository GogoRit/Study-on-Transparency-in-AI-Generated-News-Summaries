Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting,\u201d Trump said, prompting loud cheers from the many thousands attending the march.\nTrump is counting on the support of his base of conservative activists to help bring him across the finish line.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant move,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of Trump\u2019s most prominent evangelical supporters. Reed said the president\u2019s appearance would \u201cenergize and remind pro-life voters what a great friend this president and administration has been.\u201d\nIt also shows how much times have changed.\nPast presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure. They sent remarks for others to deliver, spoke via telephone hookup or invited organizers to visit the White House.\nOver the last 10 years, however, the Republican Party has undergone a \u201crevolution,\u201d displaying a new willingness to \u201cembrace the issue as not only being morally right but politically smart,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PAC. The group is planning to spend $52 million this cycle to help elect candidates opposed to abortion rights. Its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, will serve as national co-chair of a new campaign coalition, \u201cPro-life Voices for Trump.\u201d\nAccording to Pew Research Center polling in 2019, roughly 6 in 10 Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Over time, though, both the Republican and Democratic parties have taken harder-line positions for and against abortion rights.\n\u201cThere used to be a middle in this country and candidates would not want to alienate the middle,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under President George W. Bush. \u201cAnd it just seems that that is over and that both parties play to their bases to get maximum turnout from their base.\u201d\nDuring his first three years in office, Trump has embraced socially conservative policies, particularly on the issue of abortion. He\u2019s appointing judges who oppose abortion, cutting taxpayer funding for abortion services and painting Democrats who support abortion rights as extreme in their views.\n\u201cPresident Trump has done more for the pro-life community than any other president, so it is fitting that he would be the first president in history to attend the March for Life on the National Mall,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere.\nThis is not the first time Trump has given serious consideration to an appearance. Last year, he wanted to go and came close to attending, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. But the trip never came together because of concerns about security so Trump joined the event via video satellite from the White House Rose Garden instead.\nTrump\u2019s thinking on the matter was simple: If he supported the cause, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t he show up to their big event?\u201d said Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union and a close ally of the White House. He said the appearance would be deeply significant for those in participants.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people be moved to tears over the fact that he\u2019s going,\u201d said Schlapp. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\nDuring his video address last year, Trump sent a clear message to the thousands of people braving the cold on the National Mall. \u201cAs president, I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence, the right to life,\u201d he said.\nThe rhetoric underscored Trump\u2019s dramatic evolution on the issue from his days as a freewheeling New York deal-maker, when he described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in a 1999 interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\nDuring his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination, Trump said his views had changed and that he was now opposed to abortion, but for three exceptions: In the case of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk.\nYet Trump\u2019s unfamiliarity with the language of abortion activism was clear, including when he offered a bungled response during a televised town hall and was forced to clarify his position on abortion three times in a single day.\nAsked, hypothetically, what would happen if abortion were outlawed, Trump said there would have to \u201cbe some form of punishment\u201d for women who have them, prompting a backlash that managed to unite abortion rights activists and opponents, including organizers of the March for Life.\nAsked to clarify his position, Trump\u2019s campaign initially issued a statement saying he believed the issue should rest with state governments. He later issued a second statement that said doctors, not women, should be punished for illegal abortions.\nCritics, for their part, accuse Trump of using the march to try to distract from his impeachment trial in the Senate.\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called it \u201can act of desperation, plain and simple.\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, accused Trump of carrying out \u201ca full-out assault on our health and our rights.\u201d\nViews of abortion have remained relatively stable over two decades of polling, and it\u2019s a minority of Americans who hold extreme opinions \u2014 that abortion should be legal or illegal in all cases. But polling does suggest a widening partisan gap on the question of support for abortion rights in all or most cases, along with some movement on both sides of the aisle further into their extreme positions.\nThe first march took place on the west steps of the Capitol in January 1974, the year after the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that established a woman\u2019s legal right to abortion.\nAssociated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report from Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n5 video moments to watch from the House managers\u2019 second day of oral arguments\nBy Candice Norwood\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, watch for these blockbuster Supreme Court cases\nBy Marcia Coyle\n\n\n\n\nWATCH: Trump launches \u2018Evangelicals for Trump\u2019 initiative\nBy Jonathan Lemire, Elana Schor, Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nGo Deeper\n\nabortion\ndonald trump news\nmarch for life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy \u2014\n\n\nJill Colvin, Associated Press\n\n\n                    Jill Colvin, Associated Press\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducate your inbox\nSubscribe to Here\u2019s the Deal, our politics\n                 newsletter for analysis you won\u2019t find anywhere\u00a0else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nForm error message goes here.\n\nThank you.
