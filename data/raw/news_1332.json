(AP) \u2014 Karen Roper was so shaken by the demise of Roe v. Wade that she joined the abortion-rights struggle in Kentucky, where the future of abortion access could hinge on a constitutional question before voters this election. Roper is part of a volunteer network canvassing neighborhoods seeking votes against the Nov. 8 ballot proposal. Kentucky voters are being asked to decide whether to amend the state constitution to declare outright that it doesn\u2019t protect the right to an abortion.The question reads: \u201cTo protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\u201dA 55-year-old mother of two daughters, Roper spent several October weekends knocking on doors in a central Kentucky town.\u201cThis issue is really beyond a candidate and it\u2019s beyond a political party,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like this was more important than even any candidate I might care about.\u201d\n\nFervor is running high on both sides. Abortion opponents see the measure as a way to end any constitutional protections for abortion in Kentucky \u2014 perhaps settling the long legal fight for good.\n\u201cThis is a pivotal moment in Kentucky\u2019s history,\u201d said Addia Wuchner, chairwoman of the pro-amendment Yes for Life Alliance.Currently, abortions are mostly on hold in Kentucky amid sparring over the constitutionality of a near-total abortion ban trigger law. Approved by lawmakers in 2019, the ban took effect after Roe was overturned. Now the ballot measure has intensified debate, with donations pouring in, politicians speaking out and advocates on both sides accusing the opposition of misleading voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, abortion-rights supporters have been encouraged by developments this summer in another conservative state, Kansas, where voters rejected a ballot measure that would have changed that state\u2019s constitution to let lawmakers tighten restrictions or ban abortions.\n\n\u201cIn a very real sense, what is at stake is any future path to restoring access to legal abortion in the commonwealth,\u201d said Rachel Sweet of Protect Kentucky Access, an abortion-rights coalition.Kentucky\u2019s constitutional battle has been brewing since the Republican-dominated legislature reserved a spot last year for the abortion measure this election cycle. The stakes are high. In June, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, and consequently abortions are on pause in Kentucky \u2014 with a narrow exception \u2014 as the state\u2019s highest court reviews the law that halted the procedures.University of Louisville student Helene Senn, part of the door-knocking campaign backing the amendment, said abortion opponents can\u2019t let this opportunity \u201cslip through our hands.\u201d The Roe decision gave her added motivation. \u201cI knew there was a greater opportunity to make such a big impact in our state,\u201d said Senn, 20. Abortion-rights supporters are using the ban in seeking to broaden opposition to the amendment. That law called for the immediate end to almost all abortions once Roe was overturned, except for abortions to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life or to prevent disabling injury. There are no exceptions for rape or incest victims.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people, that is a shocking thing to hear ... even people who really have complicated feelings about abortion do think that there should be exceptions,\u201d Sweet said. Abortion opponents say approval of the amendment would ensure abortion policy comes from the legislature \u2014 where they say it belongs \u2014 not the courts.\u201cPractically speaking, this \u2026 will keep state judges in their lane of interpreting the law and not inventing new laws and new rights that the constitution does not speak of,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Nancy Tate, a leading anti-abortion voice.The trigger law is under challenge by the two abortion clinics that remain in Kentucky \u2014 both in Louisville, the state\u2019s largest city. The lawsuit said women were being \u201cforced to remain pregnant against their will\u201d in violation of the state\u2019s constitution. Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court has kept the ban in place while reviewing the case, poised to hear arguments after the election. The suit also challenges another state law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has branded the trigger law as extreme, said the amendment vote will weigh heavily on the court case.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this constitutional amendment will keep that trigger law in effect if it passes,\u201d said Beshear. \u201cIf it fails, then the Kentucky Supreme Court is going to look at that trigger law and determine if it\u2019s constitutional.\u201d The abortion amendment has overshadowed other campaigns in a state where the GOP won total control of the legislature in 2016.Abortion-rights supporters see the measure as a chance to reverse the anti-abortion momentum that led to several lawmaker-approved restrictions and conditions on abortion, many prompting court challenges. They say the legislature\u2019s hardline stand on abortion is why constitutional protections are necessary.\n\nAbortion opponents say the anti-abortion bills passed in recent years reflect the will of Kentuckians.\u201cKentuckians value life. They value the life of the unborn child,\u201d said Wuchner, an ex-lawmaker and executive director of Kentucky Right to Life.Tate said the legislature can discuss abortion legislation \u201cany time that it is in session.\u201d That could include bills to expand exceptions to the abortion ban, where disagreement among Republicans would likely surface.\u201cI don\u2019t support exceptions,\u201d Republican state Sen. Whitney Westerfield said at a recent gathering of lawmakers against abortion. \u201cGod made each of us in his image. He knew us before he formed us in the womb. This is a religious and faith question for me.\u201d___Associated Press Writer Dylan Lovan contributed to his report from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
