This BBC Article Sums It UpCaroline Wharton - 09 Aug 2022\n\nAs the mainstream media has portrayed American youth as staunchly pro-abortion for so long, many are surprised to find that Gen Z and Millennials overwhelmingly lean pro-life rather than pro-abortion \u2014 and they are equally puzzled as to why this may be since young people are typically more liberal. A new article from BBC News interviewed several of our Pro-Life Generation activists and came up with this conclusion: young pro-lifers view the abortion issue as a social justice cause. Here\u2019s more about the coverage and why it helps illustrate our big-tent movement:\u00a0\u00a0\n(Click HERE to read our polling showing that the majority of Gen Z and Millennials want life-affirming laws that protect the preborn.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe BBC News article, entitled \u201cAnti-Abortion Gen Z-ers See Cause as Social Justice,\u201d\u00a0 written by Rianna Croxford and Chelsea Bailey, highlights the \u201cPost-Roe Generation\u201d and begins by telling the story of one of Students for Life of America\u2019s (SFLA) amazing Student Spokespersons, Noah Slayter. Slayter is a member of the SFLA group at The Catholic University of America and a former member of SFLA\u2019s SCOTUS squad. The authors note in his introduction that over the course of his involvement with SFLA, Slayter has become \u201csomething of a fixture\u201d at the Supreme Court \u2014 and they\u2019re not wrong.\u00a0\n(Click HERE to read more on our blog about the SCOTUS Squad, the group of students that essentially lived at the Supreme Court.)\u00a0\u00a0\nSlayter was back again on those steps the day that Roe v. Wade was reversed through the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling, and he told BBC, \u201cEven though it\u2019s only the first step, we truly have achieved something. We truly levelled the playing field and made it so that everyone has a voice in this country.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTexas Regional Coordinator Faith Elwonger\nOn how the youth of the pro-life movement considers abortion, he continued, \u201cEvery person in Gen Z has an understanding of Black Lives Matter, or climate change \u2013 all of these movements are for social justice and they\u2019re focused on helping people. The pro-life movement is just another aspect of that.\u201d\u00a0\nCroxford and Bailey also spoke with SFLA\u2019s Texas Regional Coordinator Faith Elwonger who told them that it is wrong to link racial justice to abortion. As a Black woman herself who consistently fights against the social justice narrative that Black women particularly need abortion, she specifically reminded the reporters, \u201cAbortion is the number one killer of the black community.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nElwonger recently made this point in an op-ed at Fox News, co-written with Omarr Peters, and entitled \u201c13th Amendment was Meant to Protect Black People, Not the Abortion Lobby.\u201d She wrote,\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhile abortion supporters love to emphasize that they \u201cstand with Black women,\u201d Faith acutely understands the degradation of this line of thought as a pro-life pregnant Black woman herself. Why are Black women being singled out as desperate for abortion and in danger if abortion is unavailable? The only answer is the implication that Black women are somehow weaker, dumber, or less resilient than women of any other skin color. This is yet another example of the abortion lobby\u2019s self-righteous attempt to be the saviors of Black women in a bizarre effort to \u201chelp\u201d us by insisting that we kill our children.\u201d\u00a0\nThrough interviews with Slayter and Elwonger, Croxford and Bailey recognized SFLA\u2019s overall mission: to make abortion \u201cnot just illegal but unthinkable.\u201d They wrote,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAs these young activists see it, outlawing abortion in the United States is not just about religion, but also about justice and part of a larger aim to extend equal rights to everyone \u2013 including the \u201cpre-born,\u201d which is how the movement describes a foetus [fetus].\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTheir take on our movement and SFLA in particular is entirely correct \u2014 we are a movement made up of people who want to protect people, whether they are born or preborn \u2013 it\u2019s that simple. Our students are widely diverse; males and females; Democrats, Republicans and independents; religions (or the lack thereof) of all flavors; the politically minded and the non-politically minded. Each of our students have their own personal stories about why they came to the pro-life movement, but they are all united by one passion: life is sacred, and we must protect it.\nAbortion is the human rights issue of our day, and the Pro-Life Generation won\u2019t stop until we have fully protected life in both law and service. \nREAD NEXT: Abortion Supporters Fittingly Dress as Clowns to Stop Pro-Lifers from Helping Women\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,542\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
