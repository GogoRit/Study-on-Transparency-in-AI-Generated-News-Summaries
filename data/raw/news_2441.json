The 43-year-old rapper has since revealed that he is against abortion as he follows \"the word of the bible\".Kanye West running for President in 2020 as he reveals Yeezy community housingDuring a recent interview with Forbes, West claimed that reproductive health care company 'Planned Parenthood' is run by \u201cwhite supremacists to do the Devil's work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSwizz Beatz Slams Kanye West With Anti-MAGA Song \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood has responded to Kanye's claims saying it's not the first time he has been \u201cparroting factually incorrect, right-wing talking points on reproductive health care\u201d.Warning: Sensitive topic addressed below.\nThe \"Fade\" rapper later took to Twitter and shared a Google search screenshot which asked the question: \u201cWhat does a 6 month fetus look like?\u201dAlongside the image, Kanye tweeted: \u201cThese souls deserve to live.\u201d\n\n\n\n    Kanye West's since-deleted tweet divides fans over controversial 'pro-life' stance.\n    \n        Picture: \nTwitter\n\n\n    \n\n\nThe screenshot showed a graphic imagery of how a fetus grows during the second trimester of pregnancy.Kanye's stance has caused controversy online, dividing fans with his political aims. \nA Twitter user responded \"Does kanye west really think that someone will carry a fetus inside them for 6 months and then get bored and decide to abort it\"The user continued \"Does he not understand that serious pregnancy complications can require inevitable late term abortions??\"\n\n\n\n    Kanye West claims he will be following \u201cthe word of the bible\u201d with is Presidential campaign.\n    \n        Picture: \nGetty\n\n\n\n\nAnother user on Twitter wrote \"a fetus is not a person and nobody is getting abortions that late term for non medical reasons and NO MAN.\"\"(especially kanye west) should be able to control what a woman does with her body\"\nHowever, many people follow the same belief as Kanye and defended his pro-life view on Twitter.One user wrote \"what's the distinction between a 6 month old fetus and a 6 week old baby that makes killing one acceptable and killing another abhorrent?\"\nMany users have perceived the tweet as Kanye is specifically against 6-month old fetus abortions, meanwhile others believe Kanye is anti-abortion altogether. Last year, Kanye compared Plan B - a contraceptive, widely known as \"morning after pill\" - to abortion, something health care officials will say is a \u201cfalse equivalency.\u201d\n> Download Our Free App For All The Latest Kanye West News!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Kanye West News\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            North West\u2019s debut album \u2018Elementary School Dropout\u2019: Everything we know so far\n            \n        \n        \n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            Kim Kardashian pictured hanging out with Kanye West\u2019s new wife Bianca Censori\n            \n        \n        \n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            Kanye West 'forgets his own lyrics' during first performance since anti-Semitic rants\n            \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            Kim Kardashian breaks silence on Kanye West's anti-Semitic comments\n            \n        \n        \n\n\nKim Kardashian\n\n\n\n\nKanye West shocks with Sunday Service complete with white hooded outfits and autopsy-style food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance Act II: \u2018COWBOY CARTER: release date & tracklist revealed\n            \n        \n        \n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            When is Euphoria season 3 coming out & how to watch it in the UK\n            \n        \n        \n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            Inside Bruno Mars\u2019 net worth in 2024\n            \n        \n        \n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n            Is Drake touring the UK and Europe in 2024?
