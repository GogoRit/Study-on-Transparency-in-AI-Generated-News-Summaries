Andrew Cuomo signed a bill legalizing abortion up until birthNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been center stage throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as his state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 263,000\u00a0confirmed cases and 16,000\u00a0deaths.As Cuomo became a\u00a0more recognizable face amid the pandemic, a viral Facebook post from March 25 claimed, \"Human life is not disposable, said NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, the man who recently signed a bill legalizing abortion up until birth.\"More:Gov. Andrew Cuomo showed a mural of donated masks to New York. Then social media weighed inNew York's abortion lawNew York state's abortion law has previously been the subject of misinformation.\u00a0It became a talking point when Cuomo signed abortion legislation codifying Roe vs. Wade into state law\u00a0in January 2019.\u00a0New York's Reproductive Health Act allows practitioners to perform an abortion on a patient who is 24\u00a0weeks\u00a0or more away from the start of a pregnancy if\u00a0the fetus is not viable or the abortion is necessary \"to protect the patient's life or health.\"The\u00a0law does not define \"health\" or\u00a0viability of a fetus.\u00a0The determination of these factors must be made by a \"health care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized\" under state law, \"acting within his or her lawful scope of practice.\"\u00a0Before Cuomo signed the legislation, abortions\u00a0after\u00a024 weeks were allowed only when the mother's life was at risk. They otherwise were\u00a0criminalized.The Reproductive Health Act also removed abortion from the state's penal code, and the statute still defines a person as a \"human being who has been born and is alive.\"\u00a0Killing a baby once born is still\u00a0considered homicide.\u00a0Typically, pregnancies range from 38 to 42 weeks\u00a0and babies are considered viable at 37 weeks. Across the country:\u00a043 states restrict abortion by gestational age.19 states ban abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy.5 states ban abortion at 24 weeks of pregnancy.18 states ban abortion based on viability of the fetus.Alabama has the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S., banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy and for any reason, including in cases of rape and incest. The law is on hold after a federal judge ruled the ban \"defies the United States Constitution.\"\u00a0Virginia has a more lenient law than Alabama in terms of time frame and bans abortion at the third trimester, which begins at 25 weeks.\u00a0A 2018 report from the CDC found that in 2015, there were 638,169 reported\u00a0abortions in the U.S. Of those, 65% of the procedures were performed at or before the eight-week mark and 91%\u00a0were performed at or before the 13-week mark. Only 1.3% of abortions recorded were performed at 21 weeks or later.\u00a0Fact check: COVID-19 can cause worse lung damage than smoking Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine has been nearly 20 years in the making Fact check: Not likely that COVID-19 vaccine was cause of Hank Aaron's death Fact check: What's true about COVID-19, its vaccine, face masks and seasonal flu?Our rating: Partly falseWe rate the claim in the Facebook post as PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. While it is true that New York's abortion law allows procedures after 24 weeks, there are rules guiding that procedure: if the fetus is not viable or if the health or life\u00a0of the mother is at risk. If medical practitioners determine that either of these factors are present, the mother can choose to have an abortion.\u00a0It is false to state or imply that any abortion can occur in New York \"up until birth\" as the social posts claims. That is misleading. Additionally, no state in the U.S. allows abortion\u00a0\"up until birth.\"Our fact-check sources:New York consolidated laws, article 125New York Reproductive Health ActAL HB314Business Insider,\u00a0Here's the latest point in pregnancy you can get an abortion in all 50 statesCDC, Abortion Surveillance, United States 2015Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
