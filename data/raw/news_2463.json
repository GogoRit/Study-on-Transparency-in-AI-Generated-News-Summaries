In the end, we as the nation of Namibia have to deal with the results of gender-based violence, rape, sexual abuse, sex outside marriage, dumping of new babies in a generation of young people who like to hear the real identity.\nOur young girls and ladies are being trapped in the arms of brutal young and old men, of whom some also grew up without a father figure. These men were never taught to show them how to first respect a woman as a person secondly the respect of her body.\nWe know we have a big percentage of single mother households, a great contribution of an unstabilised community of young people. This is because of the absenteeism of fathers in the households. Our young girls are boys are out there looking for someone to fill the gap and the need for love,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, van der Colff in her bid to prove that abortion was a murderous act, impressed upon the secretary to the NA that while still in its earliest development, a foetus is actually a human baby that can not just be terminated due to its being unwanted.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev post\nOpinion: What is happening in the National Assembly is not funny any more\n\n\nNext post\nGeingob confers national hero status on Shipanga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWonder Guchu\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n \n\n 18 March 2024 \n50% of Local Wheat Farmers Quit Production in 2023\n\n\n\n \n\n 18 March 2024 \nNow or Never for Goreangab Dam Fishermen\n\n\n\n \n\n 18 March 2024 \nNCCI Urges Businesses to Adopt Fair Pricing Practices in Public Tenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAgriculture\nNational\nTop Stories  50% of Local Wheat Farmers Quit Production in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  Now or Never for Goreangab Dam Fishermen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBusiness\nNational  NCCI Urges Businesses to Adopt Fair Pricing Practices in Public Tenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  A Nuclear Power Plant in Namibia Could Stabilise Uranium Market Prices, Says Rosatom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  Phase 1 of Ondangwa Stadium Construction Expected to Take Five Years  \u2026N$12 million annually earmarked for the next 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  SONA2020: Namibia on verge of achieving total HIV/AIDS control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  Police seize \u2018Covid-19\u2019 tea from Walvis Bay shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  World misses HIV-related deaths reduction target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  \u2018De Klerk\u2019s signatures on Fishrot documents differ\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  ENVIRONMENT\u2026GOVT PONDERS COMPLETE PLASTIC BAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nWe are a Namibian based digital newspaper.\nNew stories every Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAgriculture\nNational\nTop Stories  50% of Local Wheat Farmers Quit Production in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNational  Now or Never for Goreangab Dam Fishermen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Past Newspaper Editions\nContact Us\nLogin\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Grace Mag by Everestthemes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Also ...                        x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n50% of Local Wheat Farmers Quit Production in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNow or Never for Goreangab Dam Fishermen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNCCI Urges Businesses to Adopt Fair Pricing Practices in Public Tenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
