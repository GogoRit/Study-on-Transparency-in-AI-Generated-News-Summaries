Abortion has silenced so many voices in our nation, causing pain and suffering to be glossed over as if it is no big deal.\u00a0\nNational Pro-Life Day of Silent Solidarity, a Stand True Project, is normally the third Tuesday in October. This year, Stand True hosted a day of prayer for the upcoming election, to encourage citizens to pray for our country.\n\u00a0\nNow more than ever, we need to be a voice for the voiceless, so Students for Life is hosting a social media event Wednesday, October 28th to continue to promote silent solidarity. To participate in the National Pro-life Day of Silent Solidarity,\u202fyou and your group can join us in taking over social media, wearing a red armband/piece of red duct tape over your mouth or on your sleeve.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo participate in the\u202fNational Pro-life Day of Silent Solidarity,\u202fyou and your group can\u00a0join us in taking over social media,\u00a0wearing\u00a0a red armband/piece of red duct tape over your mouth or on your sleeve\u00a0to be a voice for the voiceless.\u202fHere are some helpful tips:\u202f\u00a0\n\nTypically, the red band/tape will have LIFE written across it in black.\u202f\u00a0\nYou can also wear a pro-life t-shirt to show your support.\u202f\u00a0\nPost to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter with a short explanation of what you are doing. The following is a good example:\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nEvery October, students nationwide give up their voices for the Pro-Life Day of Silent Solidarity. Representing the 3,000+ voices taken by abortion every day, students choose to take a one-day vow of silence and wear red tape/armband in solidarity with those whose voices have been silenced forever.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nTag\u00a0Students for Life of America and\u00a020 people in your post\u00a0to\u00a0challenge them to post a photo, tagging 20 more people to keep the chain going.
