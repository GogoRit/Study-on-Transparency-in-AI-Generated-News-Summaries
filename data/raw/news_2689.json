Fans are claiming that Dooley is a Trump supporter, and her Twitter activity, namely her likes, appears to back that claim up. \nHowever, Dooley appears to now be unliking tweets. A tweet that read \u201cWill you please pray for President Trump? He needs us now more than ever.\u201d disappeared from her likes on Wednesday. The tweet remains on the platform. \n\n\u201cThis is the man that is fighting for good and fighting for us. We need to continue to pray and fight! 88 day to go,\u201d another tweet, which also disappeared from Dooley\u2019s likes on Wednesday, read.\n\nWhile Dooley has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, some of her other likes, before disappearing, included pro-\u201cBack the Blue\u201d posts. \n\nShe also liked a message from Trump\u2019s campaign team claiming that Ivanka Trump and the president are \u201cfully committed to ending human trafficking once and for all.\u201d\n\nDooley not only appears to be a Trump supporter, but she also appears to be a believer in the QAnon conspiracy, which alleges that Trump is working to topple a cabal of Democratic pedophiles. \nDooley liked several tweets that tout a popular conspiracy among the QAnon crowd. Some QAnon believers think John F. Kennedy is alive and well (he\u2019s been dead since 1999) and that he\u2019s Trump\u2019s No. 1 fan. JFK. Jr, according to the conspiracists, was even supposed to appear at one of Trump\u2019s rallies in October but turned out to be a no-show.\n\nOther tweets that currently remain in her likes include pro-Trump video messages by actor Jon Voight.\nTwitter users, who were already aware of Dooley\u2019s apparent political affiliation, wasted no time alerting others that Dooley is a \u201craging Trump supporter.\u201d Some, who were previously unaware, are now claiming it \u201cruined\u201d the upcoming film for them. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/harleyskory/status/1329111321606901760\n\n\nwhy did lava girl have to be a trump supporter like damn i won't watch that movie anymore\u2014 mom\u274dn (@1chimon) November 18, 2020\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ayannasaloser/status/1329110776792039425\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/XOJamesMoreno/status/1329178359155150848\n\nAfter the Mean Girls Broadway musical announced that Laura Leigh Turner would be portraying Karen Smith in February, Turner received similar backlash for her Twitter activity. She was following a slew of pro-life, right-wing figures, so people accused her of also being\u00a0pro-life and right-wing. \nThe Daily Dot has reached out to Taylor Dooley.\n\nMust-reads on the Daily Dot\nAn autistic TikToker reported an ableist sound that trivializes sexual assault 4 times.
