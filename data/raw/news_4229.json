The only person who gets to decide if an abortion is \u2018essential\u2019 is the pregnant person, not the state of Texas. Abortion should never, under any circumstances, be criminalised. \n\u201cFurthermore, designating abortion clinics as non-essential will not limit the need for abortions. Restricting abortion does not reduce abortions; it makes them unsafe, which, in turn, leaves people more vulnerable. Unfortunately, we have seen this dangerous practice start to become a trend, with states like Ohio and Mississippi implementing similar restrictions. \n\u201cNo government should be using this pandemic as a cover for an anti-human rights agenda.\u201d\n\nView latest press releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  25 Mar 2020, 06:33pm\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our email list\n\nJoin our email list\n\nSign up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n Terms And Conditions\n Cookies Statement\n Cookies settings\n Privacy Notice\n Community Rules\n\n\n\nGet in touch\n\n Contact Us\n Work for Amnesty\n Events\n Venue Hire\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\n Urgent Actions\n Amnesty Shop\n Governance\n Media Centre\n Education And Training\n Safeguarding\n Other Resources\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook\nX (Twitter)\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n\n\n\n Terms And Conditions\n Cookies Statement\n Cookies settings\n Privacy Notice\n Community Rules\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in touch\n\n\n\n\n Contact Us\n Work for Amnesty\n Events\n Venue Hire\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\n\n\n\n Urgent Actions\n Amnesty Shop\n Governance\n Media Centre\n Education And Training\n Safeguarding\n Other Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Amnesty International UK 2023.
