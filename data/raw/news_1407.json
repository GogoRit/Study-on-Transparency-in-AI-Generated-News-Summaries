Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate for governor Tim Michels changed his position on abortion Friday, saying he would support exceptions to Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban after previously saying he opposed them.Michels\u2019 shift comes at a time when abortion has emerged as a pivotal issue in the race for governor, where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has pushed to overturn the state\u2019s abortion ban and Democrats have attacked Michels for opposing abortion in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade.The issue came up again Friday during an interview on WISN-AM radio, where Michels was asked by conservative host Dan O\u2019Donnell if he would sign a bill that bans abortion but includes exceptions for rape or incest.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, I would sign that bill,\u201d Michels said. \u201cI am pro-life. I make no apologies for that. I also understand that this is a representative democracy. And if the people \u2014 in this case the Legislature \u2014 brought a bill before me, as you just stated, I would sign that.\u201dMichels\u2019 remarks were a clear shift from comments he made months ago in the midst of a competitive GOP primary.In June, weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court released its landmark abortion decision, WISN-TV asked Michels whether he would sign a bill into law that added exceptions for rape and incest. At the time, he said he would not.\u201cThe 1849 Law is an exact mirror of my position and my position is an exact mirror of the 1849 law as well,\u201d Michels said.\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t support exceptions for rape or incest?\u201d asked WISN-TV reporter Matt Smith.\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Michels replied.Michels maintained his position during the GOP primary.  On July 13, during a campaign stop in Eau Claire, Michels was asked by Wisconsin Public Radio whether he would support \u201cany changes\u201d to the abortion ban.\u201cThe existing law on abortion mirrors my position on abortion,\u201d Michels said.Wisconsin Democrats also released audio earlier this month of Michels where he said he opposed adding an exception for victims of incest.\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at the people that have called me up \u2026 that said \u2018Tim, you have to soften your stance on abortion. You need to be for exception of rape and incest as well,\u201d Michels said in the clip, which Democrats said was recorded at a Republican event. \u201cI\u2019m not going to soften my stance on abortion.\u201dEvers\u2019 campaign seized on the comments, saying calling them a \u201cdishonest\u201d attempt by Michels to hide his views.\u201cWisconsin voters are smart enough to see through Tim Michels\u2019 dishonest attempt to hide his radical views on abortion, including his clear support for a ban that contains no exception for rape or incest,\u201d said Evers spokesperson Kayla Anderson. \u201cTim Michels has told us what he believes time and again.\u201dMichels\u2019 record opposing abortion goes back to at least 2004, when he ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate. Michels also donated $175,000 to anti-abortion groups in 2020.It\u2019s unclear whether he would even be given the chance as governor to sign a bill that would add exceptions for rape and incest to the state\u2019s abortion ban. While Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, has said he supports the idea, Wisconsin\u2019s leading anti-abortion groups have all said they strongly oppose it.But the idea is popular with the public. In the most recent poll by Marquette University, 63 percent of registered voters said they opposed the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. And 83 percent said they supported allowing a woman to obtain a legal abortion if she became pregnant as the result of rape or incest.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nAs 2024 campaign winds up, Democrats knock Senate candidate Eric Hovde on abortion record \n\n \n\n\n\nWhat counts as an exception to South Dakota\u2019s abortion ban?
