(Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography) \n\nWest Virginians are almost evenly split on whether they consider themselves \u201cpro choice\u201d or \u201cpro life\u201d on abortion, but few favor an outright ban, according to new survey information from the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce.\nAmong all those surveyed, 51 percent characterize themselves as \u201cpro life,\u201d according to the survey, while 45 percent say they are \u201cpro choice.\u201d\nParty identification plays a major role. Seventy-seven percent of Republican respondents said they are \u201cpro life,\u201d while 86 percent of Democratic respondents said they are \u201cpro choice.\u201d\n\nBut policy views on different aspects of abortion are more complicated.\nBrian Dayton\n\u201cThe results may be a little bit surprising to some, but when you start to think about them it does make sense,\u201d said the West Virginia Chamber\u2019s vice president for policy and advocacy, Brian Dayton, who said the organization wanted to know more about factors motivating voters during the upcoming midterm election.\n\u201cWith the Dobbs decision repealing Roe v. Wade, the stakes are a little bit higher now. And I think people are watching what\u2019s happening and maybe becoming a little bit more nuanced and really paying attention to this.\u201d\nRespondents were asked under what circumstances abortion should be legal, and each group showed a range of answers.\nOnly 13 percent of all respondents said abortion should be illegal under all circumstances. That was generally true of Republican respondents, with just 19 percent saying\u00a0 abortion should be illegal in all instances.\nA large block of respondents \u2014 39 percent of the entire group \u2014 favored abortion being legal in cases of rape, incest or saving the life of the mother. Fifty-five percent of Republican respondents agreed with that view\nSixteen percent of all respondents said abortion should be legal through the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. Twelve percent of Republicans expressed that view, and 16 percent of Democrats said the same.\nEleven percent of all respondents said abortion should be legal until viability. Only 4 percent of Republicans held that view, while 19 percent of Democrats agreed.\nThe most common view held by Democrats, 41 percent, was that all abortions should be legal. Only seven percent of Republicans expressed that view, and 18 percent of the full spectrum of respondents favored legal abortion in all circumstances.\n\nPage 2 of  WV Chamber poll\n\nContributed to DocumentCloud by Brad McElhinny (WV MetroNews) \u2022 View document or read text\n\n\n\u201cAll voters were very mixed,\u201d concluded Dayton of the West Virginia Chamber.\n\u201cTo me, it says the voters have really taken a nuanced view on this. I think a lot of times we hear from the extremes on either side, but it tells me the voters are thinking more about this issue. They are much more nuanced. The reason we like to do polling is, it cuts through the noise of social media and gets to what the voters themselves are thinking.\u201d\n\nThe @WVaChamber put together different polls regarding various topics that are frequently discussed in West Virginia, including abortion. @Brian_Dayton discusses the poll results with @HoppyKercheval.

The survey was weighted slightly to reflect the state\u2019s age, education and party registration balance. The margin of error was +/- 4 percent for the full sample of participants and slightly higher for the subgroups.\nWest Virginia\u2019s Legislature has been considering a comprehensive abortion bill that would ban the procedure except for a few circumstances. Debate broke down several weeks ago over whether medical providers should face criminal penalties and whether to provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest.\nGreg Thomas\nSpeaking separately and not specifically responding to this poll, longtime Republican political adviser Greg Thomas this week acknowledged that voter opinions on abortion are not often absolute. He said the difficulty in addressing the issue in the Legislature reflects that.\n\u201cI believe the House and Senate caucuses are center right, and I believe that\u2019s where West Virginia is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do have, though, we have a lot of far right, and we have a lot of moderate right as well.\n\u201cAnd with this abortion issue, the center right essentially wants narrow exceptions \u2014 like actual rape and incest, not kind of big loopholes that will allow other folks outside of those exceptions to get in. And I think that\u2019s where the majority of West Virginians are; I think that\u2019s where the majority of legislators are.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMore News\n\nNews\n\n\nMetroNews This Morning 3-19-24\nSummary of West Virginia news, sports, weather for Tuesday, March 19, 2024\nBy MetroNews Staff\nMarch 19, 2024 - 6:32 am\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nOne injured in Wood County helicopter crash\nThe person was taken to the hospital by a medical helicopter.\nBy MetroNews Staff\nMarch 18, 2024 - 8:30 pm\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nMan charged in woman's death in Pocahontas County\nPolice said suspect and victim were \"covered in blood.\"\nBy MetroNews Staff\nMarch 18, 2024 - 8:15 pm\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nWVU officials work to help students recover following The Lofts blaze\nBlaze occurred Friday morning. \nBy Mike Nolting\nMarch 18, 2024 - 8:06 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n  View AllHoppy's CommentaryMarch 19, 2024Manchin v.
