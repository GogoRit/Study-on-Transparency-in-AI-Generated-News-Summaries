(AP) \u2014 Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, known as one of the strictest in the United States, will now include an extremely narrow exemption under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee on Friday.Lee signed off on the bill after repeatedly arguing that the state didn\u2019t need to tweak its abortion ban even as medical experts, with the support of a growing group of Republican lawmakers, warned the statutes failed to protect doctors and pregnant patients. The law goes into effect immediately, carving a narrow option for doctors to use their \u201creasonable medical\u201d judgment in deciding whether providing the procedure can save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent major injury. However, even under the new exemption, Democratic lawmakers, reproductive rights activists and health care officials have warned that what Republican leaders came up still didn\u2019t go far enough. \n\nLast year, Tennessee\u2019s so-called trigger law was finally allowed to go into effect due to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to abortion over the summer. The state law not only banned all abortions, but also included an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d for doctors, meaning that the burden was on the physician to prove that an abortion was medically necessary \u2014 instead of requiring the state to prove the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court won\u2019t intervene in a dispute over drag shows at a public university in Texas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee House advances bill requiring local officers to aid US immigration authorities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill to undo Memphis\u2019 traffic stop reforms after Tyre Nichols death headed to governor\u2019s desk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the law that Lee enacted, doctors will now be allowed to use \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d when determining an abortion is necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant patient or to prevent irreversible, severe impairment of a major bodily function. It then adds in language that doctors may provide abortion services for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages. There is no exception for rape and incest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegislatures across the country have been pulling in opposite directions on the issue. In over a dozen other states, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy, with courts blocking enforcement of total bans in four more states. The majority of those bans were adopted in anticipation of Roe being overturned, and most do not have exceptions for rape or incest. \n\nOverall, the final version that was able to clear Tennessee\u2019s GOP-dominant Statehouse was much more narrow than what backers initially proposed. The original bill would have allowed doctors to provide abortion services for \u201cmedically futile pregnancies,\u201d as well as lethal fetal anomalies. Also, it would have allowed doctors to provide abortions based on their \u201cgood-faith judgement\u201d \u2014 which experts say allows more flexibility than the harsher standard of \u201creasonable medical judgment.\u201d The significant changes were made after the state\u2019s powerful anti-abortion lobby, Tennessee Right to Life, warned that lawmakers would likely face political retribution if they advanced a bill without the group\u2019s endorsement. The group played a major role in advancing the state\u2019s trigger law in 2019, when access to abortion was still constitutionally protected in the U.S.Lee and others had argued that they believed patients were protected under the trigger law and that no doctor had faced felony charges since it had gone into effect. \n\nAfter the signing the exemption into law, Lee\u2019s office said in a statement that the governor was \u201chappy to work with the General Assembly to provide even greater clarity in Tennessee law to protect mothers and children.\u201dMaternal health will benefit from the exemption, but it still falls short, said a statement from the Tennessee Medical Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group representing physicians.\u201cFor example, TMA is disappointed that the bill does not exempt addressing fatal fetal anomalies from the criminal statute as the sponsors set out to accomplish,\u201d the group said. \u201cAlso, we do not believe the legal standard by which doctors are judged when addressing life and health concerns of the mother provide the level of protection needed for doctors and patients.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
