And if quarantine is extended, then it will not be about hundreds, but about thousands,\u201c\u00a0said Lyudmila Denisova.\nUkraine has a thriving surrogate industry and is one of the few countries that legally allows the service for foreigners.\nConcern is high that a long border closure will place a burden on clinics and distress the parents.\nThe issue attracted wide attention after BioTexCom, the country\u2019s largest surrogate operation, posted a video showing dozens of babies in bassinets arrayed in tight rows in two large rooms of its Hotel Venice where the clinic puts up clients.\nAt BioTexCom, a surrogate mother receives between $15,000 and $17,000 for giving birth to a baby.\nRafa Aires from Spain managed to get in before the lockdown. He was united with his daughter Marta but cannot leave as Kyiv has suspended almost all flights and he needs to finish the paperwork.\nIt means a stressful wait for his wife, Maria, who was unable to travel with him due to work.\n\u201cEvery day I make video calls with my wife for one hour or an hour and a half for her to see the baby,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very difficult.\u201d\n\u201cNurses and medical personnel in this hotel are wonderful. They make my life easier,\u201d he said.\nBioTexCom\u2019s video,\u00a0which aimed to reassure absent parent that their little ones were receiving good care, showed nurses bathing and caressing them and spurred the government into action.\n\u201cThe issue remains unresolved, but we are developing a mechanism to get out of the situation,\u201d said Denisova, who met with foreign ministry representatives on Thursday.\nUnder the proposed mechanism, foreign parents would have to write a statement addressed to Denisova\u2019s office, which would then contact the ministry with a request to give permission to enter Ukraine.\nAbout 50 clinics that offer surrogate births operate in Ukraine. The country\u2019s economic struggles drive many Ukrainian women to become surrogate mothers.\nThe government says it can only permit parents to enter\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0if it receives a request from the relevant embassy.\nUkraine\u2019s restrictions are to remain in place until at least May 22.\nSource: News Agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
