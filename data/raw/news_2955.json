In Tuesday's Democratic primary in my home state of Connecticut, voters overwhelmingly backed incumbent state Rep. Trene\u00e9 McGee, the only Democrat in the state legislature to vote against the state's expansive pro-choice legislation. Whatever you think about abortion, unless you adhere to the most extreme positions on either side, you will recognize the value of having pro-life Democrats and even a few pro-choice Republicans in state legislatures. McGee won her seat last December in a special election, becoming the first Black person to represent the 116th district.\nAt U.S. Catholic, economist Anthony Annett compares the post-COVID-19 landscape to the situation after the Spanish flu a hundred years ago, and how Pope Francis' vision in Fratelli Tutti and elsewhere could serve to forge a more humane and just social order after the virus has exposed many of our societal ills so clearly.\nAt America, Vatican correspondent Gerard O'Connell reports on Cardinal Michael Czerny's going to Auschwitz to celebrate a Mass marking the 80th anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Edith Stein, who converted to Catholicism before the war and became a religious sister. Czerny also spoke about his own Jewish heritage: His grandmother was also at Auschwitz, but was moved as the Soviet armies advanced, and died in 1945. The cardinal's grandfather and two uncles were also murdered by the Nazis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis column by First Things senior editor Julia Yost at The New York Times about conservative hipsters in NYC joining the Catholic Church generated a lot of buzz on Twitter. Is it just that I am old that I find an inverse relationship between the Twitter buzz and genuine insight? Of all the odd things Yost asserts, this is the oddest: \"Moreover, Catholicism has sometimes been seen as a threat to bourgeois order.\" Excuse me, but the \"sometimes\" can disappear: Catholicism always challenges the economic premise of bourgeois order and, consequently, bourgeois order itself.\nIt is rich hearing Republicans saying it is time to defund the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after the agency executed a search warrant at the home of former President Donald Trump. The FBI is not technically \"the police\" but they certainly count as law enforcement. It is especially delicious that Trump signed legislation in 2018 strengthening the penalties for removing classified government documents, ostensibly as a response to his campaign attacks on Hillary Clinton. Now, that same law might be the one used against Trump.\nNBC Channel 4 in New York reports on migrants being sent to New York City with little guidance or assistance, sometimes even with wrong addresses of place to seek assistance. The need for comprehensive immigration reform remains strong and yet has never seemed more remote as a political prospect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMost Read Stories\n\n\n \n\n#1 New combative faith group to host 'Catholic prayer' for Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n \n\n#2 Attacking Pope Francis, anonymous cardinal seeks to curb the influence of his papacy\n \n\n#3 Here in the US, Catholicism is for sale\n \n\n#4 The Catholic Church needs married priests now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanRome biblical and Eastern institutes merged with Gregorian UniversityByCindy WoodenCatholic News Service\n \n\nNewsLife-threatening safety concerns keep Burkina Faso Catholics away from Sunday MassByTonny OnyuloOSV News\n \n\nVatican NewsVaticanThe first outside legal analyses of Vatican's 'trial of the century' are in, and they're criticalByNicole WinfieldAssociated Press\n \n\nFrancis, the comic stripVaticanFrancis, the comic stripByPat Marrin\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR's Free NewslettersSelect any of the newsletters below, then enter your email address and click \"subscribe\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per dayDaily Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updates: The latest news and feature articles\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Daily: (the latest articles, sent every morning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x per weekWeekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture Weekly: NCR staff talk music, television, books, movies and more\n\n\n\nEarthBeat Weekly: Environment editor Stephanie Clary dives into the week's climate change news\n\n\n\nMichael Sean Winters: The nexus between religion and politics\n\n\n\nNCR Book Club: Find your latest book to read\n\n\n\nScripture for Life: Reflections on the Sunday readings\n\n\n\nSunday Resources: Reflections on the readings sent two months ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x WeeklyBiweekly Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Francis Chronicles: Get to know the pope's pastoral side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Sections\n\n\nNCR Sections\n\n\nNews\n\n\nVatican\n\n\nCulture\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nSpirituality\n\n\nSunday Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Channels\n\n\nEarthBeat\n\n\nGlobal Sisters Report\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCR Footer Menu\n\n\nWays to Give\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nBecome a Member\n\n\nYour NCR Legacy\n\n\nFriends & Tributes\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nSubscribe to NCR\n\n\nRenew Subscription\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\nFree Newsletters\n\n\neNCR and Kindle Edition\n\n\nRequest a sample issue\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nHow to write for NCR\n\n\nLetters to Editor\n\n\nJob Opportunities\n\n\nChange your address\n\n\nReprints\n\n\n\n\nAbout NCR\n\n\nMission & Values\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nStaff and Contributors\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\nDonors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Catholic Reporter\nFollow\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nTikTok\n\n\nAdvertising Guidelines / \n  Terms of Use / \n  Privacy Policy / \n  Site Map\n/ Mailing Address: 115 E Armour Boulevard Kansas City, MO 64111 / Phone Number: +1-800-444-8910\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
