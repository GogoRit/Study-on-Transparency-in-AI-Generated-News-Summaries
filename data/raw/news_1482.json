(Jessica Tezak/For the Washington Post)Listen8 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveStates that have enacted abortion bans saw a 10.5 percent drop in applicants for obstetrics and gynecology residencies in 2023 from the previous year, according to new data from the Association of American Medical Colleges.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThat decline carries a potential long-term impact on the availability of doctors to care for pregnant people and deliver babies across a large swath of the South and Midwest because medical residents often choose to stay and work where they trained.\u201cEverybody is saying they knew this would happen, but this is concerning,\u201d said Atul Grover, who leads the association\u2019s Research and Action Institute to examine the most pressing issues affecting American health care. He has a message to policymakers: \u201cYou may be discouraging some of the best candidates from coming to your state to train.\u201dAdvertisementThe abortion bans implemented across more than a dozen states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last June prompted many medical students to question whether states with new restrictions would offer them the training necessary to care for patients.A race to teach abortion procedures, before the bans beginWhen it came time to submit applications to OB/GYN training programs last fall, Lucy Brown decided against storied medical residencies in Texas and Florida. Nor, to her disappointment, would the Indiana medical student be training close to her family in Kentucky, a region that is losing obstetricians even as its maternal mortality crisis worsens.In her clinical rotations through Indiana University School of Medicine, the 26-year-old has cared for patients who needed to terminate pregnancies because of cancer and other health reasons. Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban last August that a judge has blocked while the law is being challenged in court.Advertisement\u201cWhen you are in a blue state, you can give her all her options. But in a red state, you are just like, sorry, there\u2019s nothing more that we can do,\u201d said Brown, who decided to do her residency in Maryland, where abortion remains legal. \u201cEverything is up in the air whereas in a blue state, I just follow the guidelines. I can just counsel the way I\u2019m supposed to counsel.\u201dGrover cautioned that it is too early to tell exactly what\u2019s driving the decline in interest in OB/GYN residencies in states with abortion restrictions. The association also found a 5 percent drop in OB/GYN applicants nationally. Despite the decline, nearly all of the 1,503 residency positions were filled this year because the number of applicants exceeded the number of training slots available, the association said.Applicants for residencies for emergency medicine \u2014 where many obstetric complications are first treated \u2014 also dropped dramatically across the country.AdvertisementAbortion bans influenced Mindy Sharon\u2019s decisions about where to pursue a residency in emergency medicine because ER doctors may need to terminate pregnancies or work with OB/GYN doctors to terminate them. Sharon, who is graduating from the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, W.Va., next week, felt she could not receive a well-rounded medical education in states where abortion is outlawed.While abortion bans generally create exemptions to protect the life of the mother, hospitals and doctors say ambiguities in laws have resulted in medically necessary abortions being delayed or denied and caused confusion in emergency rooms.\u201cIt really ties peoples\u2019 hands,\u201d said Sharon, 31. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be in a situation of letting that decision dictate what type of care I could give.\u201dShe decided against applying to residencies in Texas, despite it being home to multiple coveted emergency medicine programs, because of the state\u2019s ban on abortion. And she no longer saw West Virginia, where she also received her bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s in public health, as suitable for the final leg of her education after lawmakers passed a near-total ban on abortion.Advertisement\u201cThe way health care has been treated here with this ban and the politics of it all just don\u2019t align with my values,\u201d said Sharon, who will head to Stanford Medicine in California this summer. \u201cI would love to come back and take care of West Virginians, but for right now, this is not a place that\u2019s going to advance my training.\u201dThe fall of Roe scrambles abortion training for university hospitalsThe Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires OB/GYN residency programs to offer education and training in comprehensive family planning \u2014 including clinical experience in induced abortion \u2014 to maintain accreditation, prompting programs in states with bans to send residents to other jurisdictions for training.Share this articleShare\u201cClinical experience in performing induced abortions is essential to the evidence-based practice of obstetrics and gynecology, and the decision was made to preserve the integrity of the requirement for preparing physicians to practice anywhere in the United States,\u201d the council said in a statement by spokesman Justin Dreyfuss.AdvertisementTennessee\u2019s abortion ban has complicated the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine\u2019s ability to train doctors in abortion care and attract applicants to its obstetrics and gynecology residency, said Nikki Zite, vice chair of education and advocacy at school\u2019s OB/GYN department.Sending residents out of state for abortion training can be complicated, she said. Two residents who were unable to obtain licenses to train in another state were only able to observe abortions instead of receiving hands-on training. Other residents with young children may not want to leave town for more than a weekend.As legislators weigh further abortion restrictions in the neighboring states of North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina, Zite said officials at the University of Tennessee hospital are exploring options to offer abortion training as far away as Chicago, New York and Pittsburgh.AdvertisementZite, who used to run the university hospital\u2019s OB/GYN residency program, worries more doctors will turn away from OB/GYN as a specialty because of the complications caused by abortion bans.\u201cWe are already seeing OB/GYN deserts, places where hospitals close or they had to close labor and delivery units due to lack of providers,\u201d Zite said. \u201cThat means patients are traveling for their care and unfortunately that means more disjointed care and potentially metrics they are trying to improve like maternal mortality and other complications are going to go up.\u201dIngrid Skop, an obstetrician and director of medical affairs at Charlotte Lozier Institute, which opposes abortion, said it is \u201cpremature to draw the conclusion that states with abortion restrictions will have fewer physicians choosing to attend residencies there.\u201dSkop said she had spoken to many medical students who do not want to be trained to perform abortions during their residencies. Medical residents have long been allowed to opt out of participating in induced abortions for moral or religious objections, according to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\u201cThe procedures and medications used to perform elective abortions are the same used to manage pregnancy loss,\u201d Skop said, \u201cso residents will obtain adequate experience without actively ending human life.\u201dAdvertisementThe waning medical student interest in furthering their OB/GYN training in states with abortion bans comes at a time when established members of the medical profession are also exploring ways to respond to the new restrictions. Medical professional organizations are debating whether to hold their annual meetings in states with bans, and some senior doctors are opting not to work in those states.A challenge for antiabortion states: Doctors reluctant to work therePamela Parker, an OB/GYN who worked for years in Texas along the Rio Grande, said she left the state following the enactment of its six-week abortion ban because she could no longer work in such a restrictive climate.\u201cAs I seek jobs, I keep the Guttmacher map on my desktop,\u201d Parker said, referring to the reproductive rights research organization that tracks state restrictions on abortion. \u201cI get a lot of requests for temporary or permanent jobs from states with bans, and I let them know why I would not ever practice in their state.\u201dAdvertisementCarrissa Gomez, a first-year medical student at the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine, said abortion laws would definitely influence where she eventually seeks a residency because she wants to learn how to perform elective abortions as she sees reports of women struggling to find doctors willing to provide them.\u201cIt is a number one factor for me,\u201d said Gomez, 31, who can\u2019t envision herself training in Florida, where many of her peers complete rotations, or her home state of Texas. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever wanting to practice in a state that has abortion bans even if I don\u2019t go into OB/GYN practice.\u201dMedical students also worry about their safety working in states roiled in intense debates over abortion.Brown, the Indiana University School of Medicine student, said she is hesitant to practice in states with lax gun laws and aggressive antiabortion movements. She was shaken by the experiences of her mentor Caitlin Bernard, an obstetrician-gynecologist and professor at her school who was investigated by the Indiana attorney general and faced backlash after sharing a story of providing an abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim who could not receive an abortion in her home state.\u201cI witnessed how she dealt with literal threats to her life, just horrifying things. It\u2019s not something I would wish on anybody, and it\u2019s not something I myself could handle here,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good learning environment.\u201dU.S. abortion access, reproductive rightsTracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat. Abortion and the 2024 election: Voters in a dozen states in 2024 could decide the fate of abortion rights with constitutional amendments on the ballot in a pivotal election year.
