Like in last year\u2019s demonstrations, they defied Poland\u2019s pandemic ban on gatherings.\nNo violence was reported on either side. Some of last year\u2019s marches led to clashes with police.\nMore protests were planned on Thursday.\nThe ruling right-wing Law and Justice party is widely seen as having undue influence on the judiciary following reforms it passed affecting the way judges are appointed.\nThe Constitutional Tribunal was the first to have some of its judges appointed the new way, in 2016.\nThe main opposition Civic Platform party condemned the court\u2019s move on Wednesday as \u201ca provocation\u201d by Law and Justice.\n\u201cThe government is trying to cover up its incompetence (in dealing with the pandemic) and is doing that in a cynical way,\u201d Civic Platform leader Borys Budka tweeted.\nAnother opposition leader, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, tweeted urging the government to \u201csave the economy, don\u2019t set Poland ablaze\u201d.\nPeople gather in Warsaw to protest after the country\u2019s top court made a controversial ruling (Czarek Sokolowski/AP)\n\nIt was made in response to a motion from over 100 ruling party lawmakers, whose names have not been made public.\nTermination of pregnancy will now be allowed only if the woman\u2019s health is threatened or if the pregnancy is the result of a criminal act, such as rape or incest.\nUntil now, congenital defects were the reason behind most legal abortions in Poland.\nA prominent lawmaker for Law and Justice, Marek Suski, said work will begin on an entirely new abortion law that will take into account lethal defects.\nIt would replace the current 1997 law, based on a compromise with the Catholic Church and widely criticised.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\tTrending Stories\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman (69) jailed for setting fire to her curtains in a \u2018cry for help\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIslander found guilty of attacking man with wooden bat\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMan (60) bites arm of store detective\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFraudsters steal more than \u00a32m from Islanders\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPolice release image after customer was \"verbally abusive and threatening\" in St Helier shop\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMotion on extension of EU law to Northern Ireland is defeated at Stormont\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJury out in trial of mother accused of murdering toddler\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Drakeford faces his last First Minister\u2019s Questions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVideo shows group trying to stop suspected XL bully during attack\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19 March, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore UK News\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRead the latest free supplements\t\t\n\n\t\t\tRead the Town Crier, Le Rocher and a whole host of other subjects like mortgage advice, business, cycling, travel and property.\t\t\nRead More\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a9 2024 Jersey Evening Post.
