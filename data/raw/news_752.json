access to abortion further out of reach for millions of women as Republican-led states rush to limit the procedure since the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe v. Wade.\n    \n\n            Trigger laws in three states \u2013 Idaho, Tennessee and Texas \u2013 will take effect Thursday, banning abortions in their respective states with few exceptions, though litigation continues around certain aspects of some of those states\u2019 bans. These laws were designed to take effect 30 days following the US Supreme Court\u2019s transmission of its judgment overturning Roe v. Wade \u2013 a procedural step by the court that occurred on July 26.\n    \n\n            On Saturday, an Oklahoma law enacting higher criminal penalties for performing illegal abortions takes effect, adding to the state\u2019s already tough laws prohibiting the procedure.\n    \n\n            For about 9.9 million women of reproductive age (15-49) in these five states, access to abortion will be impacted by these laws, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights. With these laws in place, nearly one-third of US states will have restrictions or a near-total ban on abortion, according to abortion rights groups.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gather to protest against the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v.

Like Texas, Tennessee would also not allow for abortions in cases of rape or incest.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - A sign reading \"My body, my Choice,\" is taped to a hanger taped to a streetlight in front of the Idaho State Capitol Building on May 3, 2022.

Idaho\u2019s trigger law prohibits performing abortions unless necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman, or in situations of rape or incest that have been reported to law enforcement. A federal judge issued a preliminary order Wednesday blocking enforcement of Idaho\u2019s ban in certain medical emergencies, granting a request from the Biden administration, which had argued that Idaho\u2019s ban opened doctors up to prosecution for abortion care they were obligated to offer under federal law.\n    \n\n            The Idaho decision came a day after a dueling decision in a Texas case that concerned how that state\u2019s abortion ban interacted with federal law setting standards for emergency room care. \n    \n\n            The Biden administration has argued that the federal law \u2013 known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or EMTALA \u2013 obligates doctors to offer abortion care to patients who are facing the threat of death or other serious health risks because of a pregnancy. A federal judge in Texas late Tuesday pushed back on that interpretation, granting a request from Texas and a national organization that the judge block the administration from using the law to require that providers offer abortion care for emergency patients in the face of a state ban on the procedure. In Idaho, the judge agreed with the Justice Department arguments that EMTALA preempted state abortion bans when those bans would criminalize procedures for medical emergencies contemplated by the federal law.\n    \n\n            Both cases could be appealed, setting up the possibility that the Supreme Court may be asked in the coming weeks to weigh in on the reach of the federal law and whether it preempts state abortion bans in emergency care situations.\n    \n\n            Additionally, organizations that offer financial and logistical assistance to people seeking abortions filed a federal lawsuit this week in Texas asking for the court to block the enforcement of its trigger ban and other bans on abortion for conduct that happens out of state.\n    \n\n            North Dakota\u2019s trigger law that bans abortions in most circumstances was set to take effect on Friday, but a state judge on Thursday issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the ban. \n    \n\n            Judge Bruce Romanick, of the South Central Judicial District in Burleigh County, said he was issuing the preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo in the state, while the challenge to the law brought by Red River Women\u2019s Clinic, the state\u2019s sole abortion clinic, unfolded in court. \n    \n\n            The state currently allows abortion up until 20 weeks or more post-fertilization.\n    \n\n            North Dakota\u2019s abortion ban, approved in 2007, would make it a felony to perform an abortion in the state with exceptions for the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
