And it\u2019s becoming even louder in the weeks leading up to midterm elections.\n\u201cIt injected something into these elections that people didn\u2019t anticipate,\u201d said Jim Moore, Pacific University associate professor of politics and government.\nThird Congressional District candidate Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Stevenson, is among the crowd of candidates using the nationwide uproar to urge citizens to act, specifically to vote for lawmakers who will prevent further restrictions on abortion.\n\n\nEditors noteThis story was prompted by Clark Asks, The Columabian\u2019s reader-guided reporting project. Readers submitted questions for us to ask of congressional candidates, including where the candidates stood on abortion rights. To submit your question, visit The Columbian\u2019s Clark Asks page.\n\n\nIn a television ad aired early this week, Perez taps on this fervor to protect reproductive rights that has now become central to her campaign, in part, because it\u2019s personal. In 2020, Perez had a miscarriage that required her to receive an abortion, and without it, she could have died.\nShe pressed further in the video, condemning her opponent, Joe Kent, R-Yacolt, and his anti-abortion views.\n\u201cThe last thing women need is extreme politicians like Joe Kent standing between us and critical medical care,\u201d Perez said. \u201cJoe Kent would outlaw abortion with no exceptions \u2014 even when a mother\u2019s life is at risk. If he had his way, I could have lost my chance to have children, or worse.\u201d\nLike Perez alluded to in her video, Kent has anti-abortion beliefs. He previously told The Columbian he was ecstatic that Roe v. Wade was handed back to the states and supported components in Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s proposed federal abortion ban bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript is required to use this form.

If we're able to investigate it further, we'll get in touch with you.  Feel free to encourage your friends to ask questions, too!Here are some recent questions we've answered:Clark Asks: Why abandoned buildings can't be used to house people experiencing homelessness? It's complicatedClark Asks: If a tree falls into your home ... what then?Clark Asks: Reader\u2019s question about a red 'S\u2019  leads to story of little log cabin that once housed popular German restaurant in VancouverThe Totem Pole was a Hazel Dell staple; landmark restaurant served travelers and locals for decades\n\nThat legislation would prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother. Kent said if a person becomes pregnant because of rape or incest, they should be given resources to see their pregnancy through and make adoption easier if that is their preferred path. If a mother\u2019s health is at risk and an abortion is needed to save her life, it is permissible in Kent\u2019s eyes \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t view it as an abortion, rather a \u201ctriage.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling became enmeshed in Democratic campaigns around the country, Moore said, but it also seemed to upend Republicans\u2019 game plan and campaign focuses.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear a lot of Republicans who believe that all abortion should be banned \u2026 all of a sudden saying that they\u2019re in mainstream once again (and) fighting for those voters who might say, \u2018I support abortion in some cases,\u2019\u201d he said, referencing Oregon Republican congressional candidates retooling their anti-abortion stances.\nAlthough Kent agreed with points outlined in Graham\u2019s bill, he has joined fellow Republicans who criticized the bill\u2019s timing, saying it distracts from inflation and other economic issues that GOP lawmakers are tapping on in their campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nMoving forward, Republicans need to reposition their messaging for them to \u201cwalk the walk\u201d in upholding abortion bans, Kent said. He suggested that Republicans should focus on providing federal and state assistance to crisis pregnancy centers for people to seek care.\n\u201cFor far too long, I think Republicans never really had to step up to the plate of the abortion issue. They could just say \u2018Yeah I\u2019m pro-life,\u2019 or they knew that it was a good bumper sticker for a fundraiser,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s incumbent upon our messaging. Not just saying, \u2018You can\u2019t kill babies anymore.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nAlthough a federal abortion ban like Graham\u2019s won\u2019t likely become law, it solidifies fears within abortion advocates who fear what comes next if Republicans gain the majority in Congress. Political campaigns focusing on reproductive rights are especially useful in anti-abortion states, but it may have a different outcome in Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. It\u2019s good for fundraising but, considering Washington is a strong pro-choice state with a high voter turnout, it\u2019s unknown whether it will affect elections, Moore said.\n\u201cThe people who are in favor of abortion are already going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just going to make them more enthusiastic, but it\u2019s not going to change whether they vote or not.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n \nVice President Harris will tour Minnesota clinic that does abortions, a first for a president or VP\nPoliticsMarch 14, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n \nAsked to clear up abortion bans, GOP leaders blame doctors and misinformation for the confusion\nNation & WorldMarch 11, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n \nMore Black women say abortion is their top issue in the 2024 election, a survey finds\nPoliticsMarch 7, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n \nPatty Murray invites woman affected by Idaho abortion ban to Biden speech\nNorthwestMarch 5, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n \nFrance becomes the only country to explicitly guarantee abortion as a constitutional right\nNation & WorldMarch 4, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n \nAlabama IVF ruling highlights importance of state supreme court races in this year\u2019s US elections\nNation & WorldMarch 3, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Realtor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Listings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\u00a0\n3rd Congressional DistrictClark Asks \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLauren Ellenbecker\nColumbian staff writer\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nClark County Sports Courts & Crime Life Opinion Obituaries Legals Death Notices Blogs Vital Statistics \n\n\nHelp\n\nContact Us Newsroom Contacts Report a Website Bug Retail Locations Place an Ad Submit an Event Commercial Printing Services Careers at The Columbian Send a Letter to the Editor Newspaper Archives \n\n\nConnect\n\nSubscribe Donate Today's Paper Newsletters Newspaper in Education Best of Clark County Jobs Real Estate Classifieds The Columbian Shop \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Columbian.
