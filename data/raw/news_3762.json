Unfortunately, the UNFPA methodology for measuring progress is misleading because only complete lack of decision-making power relating to health care and contraception is defined as disempowerment. If a woman says decisions over her body are made jointly with her husband or partner, it is considered that she is \u201cempowered\u201d and can \u201cmake her own decisions\u201d, which is not accurate. Due to these limitations, we avoid the language used in the report because true empowerment means complete, not partial, bodily autonomy.\nRegional variation and stagnation\nIn Middle- and Western Africa, less than 40% of women have a say in SRHR decisions regarding their bodies, whereas almost 80% do so in some countries in Europe, South-eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.\nAmong the 57 countries with available data, Ecuador had the highest score at 87%, followed by the Philippines and Ukraine at 81%. The lowest scoring countries were Mali, Niger and Senegal, where less than 10% of women participate in SRHR decisions.\nProgress towards women\u2019s bodily autonomy has stagnated in 40% of all survey countries and some have even slid backwards in recent years. In Benin, for example, the proportion of women with some decision-making power has decreased from 41% to 36% since 2006.\nEducation is key to empowerment\nThe report found that on average, women who are older, more educated, wealthier, or living in cities were more likely to have a say in what happens to their bodies.\nAfrican school girl\nIncreasing levels of education had by far the strongest effect on women\u2019s empowerment. Women who acquired at least some level of primary education were 38% more likely to have some decision-making power than those who did not receive any education. This is in alignment with previous research which shows that the higher a woman\u2019s education level, the smaller the number of children she is likely to bear in her lifetime.\nPolitical barriers\nThe report also examined progress towards removing some of the laws and regulations that prevent women from fulfilling their sexual and reproductive health needs and rights.\nMajor shortcomings remain, in particular regarding lack of sex education and access to abortion care. The report states:\n\n\u201cTo achieve the Goal [SDG 5] by 2030, unnecessary legal, medical, clinical and regulatory barriers to the utilization of sexual and reproductive health services must be removed, and changes in social norms and government policies that allow women and girls to fully exercise their reproductive rights must be prioritized.\u201d\n\nThe authors point out that provision of SRH services is not enough and that governments must also focus on promoting\u00a0women\u2019s autonomy as without it, universal access to SRHR cannot be achieved. In addition, advancing gender equality has unmatched positive impacts on all other Sustainable Development Goals. It is high-time that investment in women\u2019s empowerment is recognised and implemented as the powerful tool that it is, both for improving lives and solving our biggest crises.\n\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nPost\n\nRelated content\n\n\n\nThe most powerful action to save the planet is the most neglected one\n\nIn our latest blog post, our Digital and Communications Officer, Olivia Nater, writes that as well as being just and morally essential, achieving global gender equality would make an unparalleled\u2026\n\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Rights\n\nThe UN has projected that gender equality won\u2019t be achieved until the next century.
