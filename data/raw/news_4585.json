The bill passed with bipartisan support: 39 Republican representatives and 12 Republican senators joined all the Democrats to vote yea. A USA Today op-ed by Evan Wolfson, leader of the Freedom to Marry campaign, called the Respect for Marriage Act \u201ca triumph for families [and] freedom.\u201d\nThe impetus for the Respect for Marriage Act was Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s opinion supporting the majority in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. Unsatisfied with trashing the 50-year-old right to abortion, Thomas urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to revisit \u2014 presumably to overturn \u2014 \u201call\u201d the precedents of Roe establishing constitutional protections of personal, intimate decisions. Among these are the rights of married people to use contraception and of same-sex couples to have consensual sex and marry.\nEnough lawmakers were alarmed by the potential obliteration of long-established freedoms to rescue at least one. But they could not manage to restore what Dobbs actually obliterated: pregnant people\u2019s\u00a0human right\u00a0to bodily autonomy.\n\n\n\n\n      Most Read    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed                  \n                    Shawn Musgrave                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits                  \n                    Ken Klippenstein                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year and a half earlier, just weeks after Texas banned almost all abortions and a national ban loomed, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, \u201cto protect a person\u2019s ability to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy and to protect a health care provider\u2019s ability to provide abortion services,\u201d was rushed out of committee. The bill had 215 co-sponsors, all Democrats, and zero Republican support. It passed the House in September 2021 and faltered in the Senate when three Ds and three Rs ducked out and West Virginia Democrat-in-name-only Joe Manchin voted against the motion to proceed. When the Republican Party takes control of the House in January, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act will be dormant for the duration.\nWhy did same-sex marriage sail through Congress with barely a headwind, while reproductive liberty continues to meet typhoons of opposition \u2014 or at best, lose momentum and go nowhere?\nThe reason: While same-sex marriage upholds the family, abortion\u2019s principal job \u2014 its superpower \u2014 is to free women, and the sex they have, from it. This is an uncomfortable fact for some reproductive rights activists, who try to shoehorn abortion into the conservative arguments that support marriage.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n            Read Our Complete Coverage          \nThe End of Roe\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.\u201d That is not the first line of a sermon delivered in a Southern Baptist megachurch. It is the first finding of the Respect for Marriage Act.\nIt could also have been the intro to the legislation the RMA repeals, the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, whose purpose was to define marriage as \u201ca legal union between one man and one woman,\u201d deny federal benefits to marital partners of the same sex, and allow states to refuse to recognize their marriages legalized elsewhere.\nPro-choice propaganda, amicus briefs, and Supreme Court opinions always point out that reproductive self-determination is good for families \u2014 that, while most abortion-seekers are young and unmarried, the majority already have children. These pregnancy-terminators, in other words, are family members.\nBut that argument only goes so far. Evan Wolfson has had it wrong all along: Families and freedom are at odds, and the freedoms that family abridges are almost always women\u2019s and children\u2019s. No wonder marriage is extolled by every patriarchal religion and authoritarian regime. The slogan of Georgia Meloni\u2019s fascist \u201cBrothers of Italy\u201d party, for instance, is \u201cGod, Family, Fatherland.\u201d\n\u201cLove, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.\u201d The missing word is sex \u2014 and marriage equality proponents do their best to keep it so. When the Vermont legislature held hearings about civil unions \u2014 the state\u2019s rehearsal for full-on marriage \u2014 lesbian and gay witnesses described their coupled lives: raising kids, playing with the dogs, paying taxes. \u201cDo you want to know what Christopher and I do in bed?\u201d one man asked. \u201cWe sleep.\u201d Just like you dried-up old married heterosexuals.\nIf marriage is (putatively) about devotion to another person, abortion protects other devotions: to art, work, friendship, solitude.\nUnlike marriage, abortion cannot divorce itself from sex. After all, a marriage can be sexless, but an unplanned pregnancy cannot. Sex could not give a fuck about the marital virtues on the list. If marriage is (putatively) about devotion to another person, abortion protects other devotions: to art, work, friendship, solitude. If marriage is about sacrifice, abortion repudiates the sacrifice of uterus-bearing people to their reproductive capacity. Love of a child or a partner may come into the decision to end a pregnancy, but in the end, the love enacted in abortion is self-love.\nAbortion, moreover, abets personal ambition, which is irrelevant and even antagonistic to happy marriage. Abortion, says the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, is \u201ccentral to people\u2019s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States.\u201d The language echoes Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, writing for the majority in 1992\u2019s Planned Parenthood v. Casey. O\u2019Connor stressed that control over reproduction is also critical to women\u2019s ability to plan families. But in this, perhaps her most-quoted sentence,\u00a0she was suggesting that would-be mothers have bigger fish to fry. Abortion emancipates them to do it.\nThe repealed Defense of Marriage Act protected the institution of marriage. The Respect for Marriage Act aims to \u201censure respect for the State regulation of marriage.\u201d But despite opposing intentions, the laws unanimously endorse marriage as an essential, benevolently regulating institution: the sine qua non of social stability and sexual order.\nWhile not articulating it, they also both stand by marriage as a handmaiden of capitalism. As Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote, the family produces workers and reproduces labor value for capitalist exploitation. Socialist feminists add that the family (meaning women) performs the unpaid care work that should be the state\u2019s responsibility to support. You don\u2019t have to be a Marxist to sense that the Respect for Marriage Act is a conservative piece of legislation.\nBy contrast, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act reads like a feminist manifesto. Restrictions on abortion are \u201ca tool of gender oppression,\u201d paternalistic,\u201d and \u201crooted in misogyny,\u201d it says. They \u201cperpetuate systems of oppression\u00a0\u2026 white supremacy, and anti-Black racism.\u201d The act promotes reproductive justice: the right not just to end a pregnancy, but also to continue one in health and dignity, and raise children in safe, nourishing, violence-free environments.\u00a0The WHPA implies that abortion is a tool of liberation, a tool to dismantle the master\u2019s misogynist, white supremacist, racist house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting.

The House passed the federal Equality Act, prohibiting \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity,\u201d in 2020 and 2021. Nobody bothered to bring it up in 2022, while Republicans campaigned against the very idea of gender identity.\nThe Equality Act is the child of the Equal Rights Amendment: \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\u201d Introduced in 1972 and approved by Congress in 1978, the Equal Rights Amendment fell three states\u2019 ratification short of the 38 required for adoption. Each year it is reintroduced and floats into a black hole.\nThe trans theorist and activist Paisley Currah argues that the function of the sex/gender system has always been to keep women from getting stuff. But as gender differentiation weakens in work, civic life, families, fashion, sex \u2014 and bodies themselves \u2014 the categories man, woman, male, and female are losing their salience. Abortion, like legal recognition of trans people, vitiates the power hierarchies seated in biology.\nWhat if potential gestators (as feminist theorist Sophie Lewis calls the carriers of fetuses, regardless of their nominal gender) had the freedom to deploy and enjoy their bodies as they wished? Would they muster Amazon armies and storm the patriarchy? Would they abandon domestic and reproductive labor and retire to their bedrooms with vibrators in hand? Would they never marry again? And if the law gives bodily autonomy to pregnant people, who else\u00a0will demand it?\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Judith Levine          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Abortion Activists Need to Win Back the Culture Before We Can Win Back the Court      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        The Right\u2019s Creeping Pro-Natalist Rhetoric on Abortion and Trans Health Care      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Roe Is Dead.
