Sounds serious, right? Is Houck a domestic terrorist, an American jihadist, a dangerous militia member, a violent felon, or someone with a prior history of violence toward law enforcement who would require such an overwhelming show of force?\nNot even close.\nHouck is a pro-life activist and president of The King\u2019s Men, a Catholic ministry. He has no prior criminal record. He was arrested Friday morning for an alleged violation of the federal\u00a0Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, known as the FACE Act.\nAgain, sounds potentially serious. But given the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s prior abuse of the FACE Act, as well as what we know already about the facts, we have serious reasons to doubt that this is a legitimate case and prudent use of federal law enforcement resources. More likely, it is a politically motivated abuse of federal law by both the FBI and the Justice Department.\u00a0\nIt is not a coincidence, we suspect, that this takedown of someone who, at best, committed a misdemeanor assault came almost exactly three months after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overruled Roe v. Wade and abortion on demand in America. The FBI\u2019s raid of Houck\u2019s home was designed to send a warning to pro-life activists engaging in activities protected by the First Amendment.\nThe FACE Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 248) forbids physically obstructing, injuring, intimidating, or interfering with anyone \u201cobtaining or providing reproductive health services.\u201d But Congress specified that the FACE Act doesn\u2019t \u201cprohibit any expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstration) protected from legal prohibitions by the First Amendment to the Constitution,\u201d including the \u201cfree speech or free exercise clauses,\u201d occurring \u201coutside a facility.\u201d \u00a0\nHouck apparently would regularly drive two hours from his home to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia to\u00a0pray\u00a0and speak outside the facility, often taking his 12-year-old son with him.\nThe federal\u00a0indictment\u00a0claims that almost a year ago, Houck \u201cverbally confronted\u201d and \u201cshoved\u201d an escort for an abortion patient \u201cto the ground\u201d and \u201cintentionally injured, intimidated and interfered\u201d with the escort.\nWhat the indictment fails to mention,\u00a0say\u00a0Houck\u2019s wife and a family spokesman, is that on multiple occasions this pro-abortion escort said \u201ccrude \u2026 inappropriate and disgusting things\u201d to the Houcks\u2019 son, such as \u201cyour dad\u2019s a fag\u201d and other vulgar slurs.\nHouck kept telling the escort to stop harassing his son, they say, but the escort refused to stop and when the foul-mouthed vulgarian got too close to his son, Houck protected him by shoving the escort away.\u00a0\nThe escort fell down, but, according to Houck\u2019s family, the only injury he\u00a0suffered\u00a0required \u201ca Band-Aid on his finger.\u201d\u00a0\nThe incident occurred Oct. 21, 2021. The assault claim against Houck is so weak that not only did Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Soros-backed\u00a0rogue\u00a0prosecutor, refuse to file any misdemeanor charges against Houck, but, the family says, a civil lawsuit filed by the escort was thrown out of court.\nNow, almost a year later, the FBI shows up at Houck\u2019s home in force and the Justice Department charges him with two felonies for an injury that required a Band-Aid. His conviction could result,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Justice Department, in a maximum penalty of \u201c11 years in prison, three years of supervised release and fines of up to $350,000.\u201d\nNo doubt, Houck\u2019s defense attorney will explore any and all defenses, starting with whether the man shoved by Houck even falls within the \u201cobtaining or providing\u201d requirement of the federal statute. It also may be a clear case of self-defense, since Houck apparently was defending his 12-year-old son from an adult who was harassing and intimidating a minor. \u00a0\nThe fact is that the Justice Department, under Democratic administrations, has a\u00a0history\u00a0of misusing the FACE Act to go after abortion opponents.\nIn 2012, for example, a federal judge in Florida\u00a0tossed\u00a0out a FACE Act indictment against Mary Susan Pine, a\u00a0 pro-life activist who had been conducting peaceful sidewalk counseling outside an abortion clinic for many years.\u00a0The judge excoriated the Justice Department for the behavior of its lawyers, saying that the indictment seemed to be the \u201cproduct of a concerted effort between the government and the [abortion clinic] \u2026 to quell Ms. Pine\u2019s activities\u201d rather than to enforce the statute.\nThe timing of this indictment of Houck also is suspect and calls into question the motive behind the Justice Department\u2019s move. If this situation played out the way the Justice Department claims, even viewed in the light most favorable to the government this was, at best, two minor incidents of misdemeanor assault.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s significant that local authorities, including the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office, decided not to file charges against Houck. It means that, for whatever reason, they didn\u2019t even think Houck\u2019s conduct warranted a misdemeanor assault charge, much less the two felony charges that he now faces.\u00a0\nMost likely, the local authorities didn\u2019t file charges because, upon examining the facts, it was, at best, a case of \u201cmutual combat\u201d in which two adults got out of hand and ended up in a minor scuffle. In such cases, typically neither party is charged, and the case goes away.\u00a0\nIf this was such an important violation of the FACE Act, what took the Justice Department 337 days to indict Houck? This is the simplest of simple, factual cases.\u00a0Houck either pushed the escort twice, unprovoked, or he didn\u2019t.\u00a0\nPerhaps the more important number is 91. That\u2019s how many days elapsed between the day the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs and Houck\u2019s indictment. Or maybe it\u2019s 49\u2014the number of days between Houck\u2019s indictment and the mid-term elections.\nAnd why did the Justice Department decide to send armed FBI agents to Houck\u2019s house in a show of force?\u00a0Houck has no criminal record, is a man of faith, and is the father of seven children. He is no threat whatsoever.\u00a0\nContrast this prosecution with the fact that vandals physically have\u00a0attacked\u00a0and damaged roughly 70 pro-life pregnancy centers, which also are protected under the FACE Act\u2019s definition of a facility that \u201cprovides reproductive health services.\u201d\nSo why hasn\u2019t the Justice Department filed a single FACE Act indictment against anyone for those crimes?\nClearly, the leadership of the FBI and the Justice Department should be asked these and other important questions surrounding this case, as well as their lack of action against real threats.\u00a0\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollections\nWeaponization of Government\n\n\n\n\ncommentary\nAre Parents Being Tagged as \u201cDomestic Terrorists\u201d by the FBI?\nNov 18, 2021   8 min read\n\n\n\ncommentary\nTakeaway From Chauvin Trial: Where Do We Go From Here?\nApr 21, 2021   4 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nCrime and Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL REPORT  Over an hour read\n\n\nTwenty-First Century Illicit Drugs and Their Discontents: Driving Down the Psychedelic Highway\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s Border Crisis Comes to the Suburbs\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  24 min read\n\n\nThe Myth of Mass Incarceration Remains Strong\u2014Despite All Evidence to the Contrary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
