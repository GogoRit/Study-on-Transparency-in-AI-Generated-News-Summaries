The number of out-of-state abortion patients in Florida grew from 3,988 in 2020 to 6,708 in 2022 \u2013 a 68% increase that probably obscures the full year-on-year impact, since Roe only fell toward the second half of 2022.Dr Robyn Schickler, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of south-west and central Florida, says she often sees out-of-state patients forced to go to great lengths to get the reproductive healthcare they need. She recalled a patient in her early 20s who came in from Texas to Orlando last year around 13 weeks pregnant.\u201cHurricane Ian came through, we had to close the center, cancel and reschedule a bunch of patients, and she ended up having to stay and ride out the hurricane,\u201d Schickler said. \u201cWe got her in as soon as we reopened so that she could go back home, but instead of just coming in and getting the healthcare she needed, she had to ride out a hurricane away from her home \u2013 that was really wild.\u201dView image in fullscreenStaff work at a Planned Parenthood clinic in West Palm Beach, Florida, in July 2022. Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty ImagesSchickler says the sheer volume of out-of-state patients has also created wait times that, in turn, have pushed Floridians from the northern part of the state further south for care.The proposed bill introduced earlier this month is expected to pass the Republican-controlled legislature and be signed by the governor, Ron DeSantis. It would go into effect only if the Florida supreme court upholds the current 15-week ban in a case it will decide at some point this year.The six-week ban would include exceptions to save a woman\u2019s life, and the limit would remain at 15 weeks in the case of rape or incest. However, women seeking an abortion under the rape and incest exception would be forced to prove their victim status with documents such as restraining orders, police reports or hospital records \u2013often rendering these exceptions meaningless, advocates say, given the barriers to reporting assault.DeSantis \u2013 who is widely expected to run for president in 2024 \u2013 publicly stated he plans to sign the bill into law. \u201cWe\u2019re for pro-life \u2026 I urged the legislature to work, produce good stuff, and we will sign,\u201d he said.A report published by Pew Research Center in 2022 revealed 62% of American adults believe abortions should be legal in \u201call or most cases\u201d, while a mere 37% believe it should be illegal. A 2020 Ipsos/Reuters poll found that 56% of likely voters in Florida believe abortion should be legal in most cases, and a similar number disagreed with the supreme court decision overturning Roe, according to a 2022 University of South Florida poll.Dr Shelly Tien, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and abortion provider in north-east Florida, believes the proposed bill is bound to have a profound effect on already marginalized patients.\u201cMany of the patients I see that are coming from out-of-state are driving because it\u2019s cheaper, and many patients are driving through the night,\u201d Tien said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients show up that are very hungry. I\u2019ve cared for patients that have to miss and reschedule appointments because their childcare falls through or they\u2019ve been unable to find someone to care for their children. I\u2019ve had patients in relationships with active intimate partner violence trying to find a time when their partner, who is also the perpetrator, is out of town so they can sneak away and have an abortion,\u201d she added.\u201cSix weeks is only two weeks after a missed period, and by that point, many women haven\u2019t realized they\u2019re pregnant. Women have irregular periods all the time for many reasons, so to prevent them from seeking abortion care after six weeks is, for all intents and purposes, a total ban. Essentially, a ban like this completely robs women, girls and their families of having any say in their own health,\u201d Tien said.Providers are bracing for the need to send a growing number of Floridians elsewhere for care.\u201cAlready with a 15-week abortion ban, there are many patients we have to refer out of state,\u201d said Amber Gavin, vice-president of Advocacy and Operations at A Woman\u2019s Choice.\u201cA six-week ban is unbelievably cruel. It narrows the window of when folks can access care and makes it so much harder,\u201d she said.\u201cObviously, we will continue referring patients out-of-state to get their care elsewhere, whether that\u2019s North Carolina, Virginia or other places.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionReproductive rightsRoe v WadeFloridaRon DeSantisWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
