Tom Sherman\nThese community leaders all have pledged to support legislation to protect and expand Granite Staters\u2019 reproductive rights and to oppose bills that would undermine those rights, or have a strong track record of doing so.\nStatement from Iris Estabrook, PPNHAF PAC Advisory Board Member:\n\u201cThe Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund PAC is proud to endorse an incredible slate of candidates for the New Hampshire Senate who can be trusted to carry on our state\u2019s longstanding tradition of supporting access to sexual and reproductive health care. With reproductive rights under unprecedented threat in New Hampshire and nationwide, it\u2019s absolutely crucial that we maintain the pro-reproductive health majority in the New Hampshire Senate. Just this year, five bills were introduced that would have restricted or created an outright ban on access to safe, legal abortion. These bills were defeated thanks to the advocacy of the champions in the New Hampshire legislature, but the next round of attacks is just around the corner. We look forward to these candidates continuing to uplift this critical issue ahead of the General Election.\u201d\nThe Trump administration is trying to push through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to replace Justice Ginsburg before the election with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade and there is an open seat on New Hampshire\u2019s Supreme Court. Now, more than ever, New Hampshire state leaders must step up and fight to expand and protect access to sexual and reproductive health care.\u00a0\u00a0\n###\nPlanned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund (PPNHAF) is an independent, nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization formed as the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England in New Hampshire.
