Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Dozens of incoming University of Michigan Medical School students walked out of a pro-life keynote speaker\u2019s address, after a previous petition to get the speaker removed failed.    Shortly after Dr. Kristin Collier, a pro-life assistant professor of medicine at UMMS, took to the stage Sunday to address the new students at their White Coat Ceremony, several dozen people got up from their seats and headed for the auditorium doors, video of the ceremony showed.A video of the walkout on Twitter quickly amassed over 200K likes.\u00a0  Image 1 of 2  \n          next\n         University of Michigan Medical School students walking out of a speech on July 24, 2022.

(Twitter/Screenshot)  Collier\u2019s speech was not expected to focus on abortion, but some students petitioned the school weeks prior to remove her as the keynote speaker over her support for the unborn.  MICHIGAN'S JIM HARBAUGH DRAWS OUTRAGE OVER PRO-LIFE REMARKS  \"I want to acknowledge the deep wounds our community has suffered over the past several weeks,\" Collier started her speech, which could have been a veiled reference to the controversy surrounding the protest or the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade.\"We have a great deal of work to do for healing to occur,\" she continued, the National Review reported. \"And I hope that for today, for this time, we can focus on what matters most: coming together to support our newly accepted students and their families with the goal of welcoming them into one of the greatest vocations that exist on this earth.\"  The protesting group included students, donning their medical white coats, and some parents. The school said 168 new medical students attended the initiation ceremony and took the White Coat Pledge and the Hippocratic Oath.  An embroidered logo of the University of Michigan Medical School. (UMMS/Twitter)The petition to remove Collier, who is also the director of the UMMS Program on Health Spirituality & Religion, was ultimately denied by the school\u2019s dean, Dr. Marschall Runge.  In his decision, he expressed the \"critical importance of diversity of personal thought and ideas, which is foundational to academic freedom and excellence,\" according to the report.    The students, in the actions they displayed Sunday, expressed their disapproval of his decision.According to the report, Dr. Collier made no mention of abortion, Roe v. Wade, or any political topic during her keynote speech. She simply encouraged students and parents and offered them advice on what to expect as they begin their careers in the healthcare field.REPUBLICANS PUSH PRO-FAMILY, PRO-MOTHER POLICIES IN WAKE OF DOBBS RULING    Ahead of the event, Collier thanked her supporters for encouraging her and helping her prepare for the speech.University of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh similarly sparked backlash for his pro-life views after he shared those views at a Right to Life event.  Dr. Kristin Collier speaks during a Be Love Revolution event. (Be Love Revolution/YouTube)\"I believe in having the courage to let the unborn be born,\" he said via, Detroit Catholic. \"I love life. I believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drives these beliefs in me. Quoting from Jeremiah, \u2018Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\u2019\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Michigan Medicine, the University of Michigan-owned academic and medical center, continues to provide abortion services as abortion remains legal in the state.\u00a0                      \n\n\n\n\nFox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.\nArrives Weekly\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n          U.S.\n         \n            Crime\n          \n            Military\n          \n            Education\n          \n            Terror\n          \n            Immigration\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Personal Freedoms\n          \n            Fox News Investigates\n          \n            Digital Originals\n          \n          Politics\n         \n            Executive\n          \n            Senate\n          \n            House\n          \n            Judiciary\n          \n            Foreign Policy\n          \n            Polls\n          \n            Elections\n          \n          World\n         \n            U.N.\n          \n            Conflicts\n          \n            Terrorism\n          \n            Disasters\n          \n            Global Economy\n          \n            Environment\n          \n            Religion\n          \n            Scandals\n          \n          Opinion\n         \n          Media\n         \n            FOX Nation Coverage\n          \n          Entertainment\n         \n            Celebrity News\n          \n            Movies\n          \n            TV News\n          \n            Music News\n          \n            Style News\n          \n            Entertainment Video\n          \n          Sports\n         \n            NFL\n          \n            College Football\n          \n            MLB\n          \n            NBA\n          \n            NHL\n          \n            Golf\n          \n            Tennis\n          \n            Soccer\n          \n            UFC\n          \n            WWE\n          \n          Lifestyle\n         \n            Health\n          \n            Food & Drink\n          \n            Auto\n          \n            Travel & Outdoors\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            House & Home\n          \n            Fitness + Well-being\n          \n            Style & Beauty\n          \n            Family\n          \n            Faith\n          \n          FOX Business\n         \n            Personal Finance\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Markets\n          \n            Watchlist\n          \n            Lifestyle\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            Tech\n          \n          Science & Tech\n         \n            Air & Space\n          \n            Security\n          \n            Innovation\n          \n            Video Games\n          \n            Military Tech\n          \n            Planet Earth\n          \n            Wild Nature\n          \n          Watch Live\n         \n            FOX News Shows\n          \n            Programming Schedule\n          \n            On Air Personalities\n          \n            Full Episodes\n          \n            Show Clips\n          \n            News Clips\n          \n          About\n         \n            Contact Us\n          \n            Careers\n          \n            Fox Around the World\n          \n            Advertise With Us\n          \n            Media Relations\n          \n            Corporate Information\n          \n            Compliance\n          \n          Apps & Products\n         \n            FOX News Go\n          \n            FOX Weather\n          \n            FOX Nation\n          \n            FOX News Shop\n          \n            FOX News Radio\n          \n            Outkick\n          \n            Newsletters\n          \n            Podcasts\n           Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Flipboard LinkedIn Slack RSS Newsletters Spotify iHeartRadio Fox News New Terms of UseNew Privacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesClosed Caption PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility Statement \n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.
