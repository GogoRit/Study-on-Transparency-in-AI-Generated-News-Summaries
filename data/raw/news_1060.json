Wade, a Texas law passed last year broadens the definition of an \u201cunborn child\u201d to begin at \u201cfertilization\u201d and include \u201cembryonic\u201d stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat type of language can raise questions about the \u201cpersonhood\u201d and rights of embryos in IVF and other fertility treatments, said Dr. Natalie Crawford, who is co-founder of Fora Fertility in Austin.\nIn IVF, Crawford said, doctors use hormone injections to save more of a woman\u2019s eggs during a menstrual cycle and take them out to fertilize them with sperm in a lab. The eggs are then allowed to grow into a blastocyst, or an implantation-stage embryo.\nCrawford said this allows doctors to select the embryo they believe has the \u201chighest chance of success\u201d for a pregnancy to put back inside the woman\u2019s uterus and save the other embryos so patients can try again or grow their family in the future. Doctors can also use these embryos to test for genetic diseases.\nOnce a person or couple no longer need the embryos, they decide whether to discard them as medical waste, donate them for scientific research or to donate them to another couple, she said. It\u2019s this step in particular that is posing a question for IVF treatments in the face of abortion bans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing that we\u2019re the most uncertain about is, \u2018could it impact discarding embryos, like when somebody is done with their family and they have remaining embryos?\u2019\u201d Crawford said. \u201cOr if they have genetically abnormal embryos, could it potentially make it harder to discard those?\u201d\nSome also worry about doctors\u2019 ability to conduct genetic testing.\nRight now, Crawford and other fertility doctors in Texas and other states are continuing IVF treatments because most laws against abortions focus on embryos during pregnancies, not outside of the womb.\n\u201cWhile they contain phrases like \u2018every stage of human development,\u2019 or \u2018from the moment of conception,\u2019 which makes us nervous, they are written in a statute that is clearly about terminating an established pregnancy,\u201d said Sean Tipton, chief policy and advocacy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine broke down \u201ctrigger laws\u201d across the country, based on its lawyers\u2019 analysis, and says Texas\u2019 trigger law \u201cdoes not appear to be applicable to IVF and reproductive medicine services prior to implantation of embryos.\u201d\nThe ASRM found that similar laws in 11 other states most likely exempt IVF and assisted reproductive technology from abortion bans, but its lawyers warned Utah\u2019s laws \u201ccould be interpreted to have an impact\u201d on assisted reproductive technology under a provision against the \u201cintentional killing or attempted killing of a live unborn child through a medical procedure.\u201d\nThe statute mostly focuses on pregnancies, but the term \u201clive unborn child\u201d is left undefined and could allow people to \u201cargue that discarding an embryo or donating an embryo for research use is an intentional or attempted killing of a live unborn child,\u201d according to ASRM\u2019s analysis.\nIn Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma, attorney generals\u2019 offices have clarified anti-abortion laws should not have implications for IVF, but Idaho\u2019s attorney general said it would be up to local prosecutors to decide how to enforce the state\u2019s trigger law, according to NBC News. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment from The Texas Tribune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipton said ASRM and its members also worry courts may interpret these laws differently and about possible changes as state Legislatures reconvene.\n\u201cWe can't speak to what state legislators are maybe gonna do in the next six months or a year and a half,\u201d he said.\nTexas\u2019 trigger law is expected to go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a formal judgment overturning Roe v. Wade, following its late June opinion against the landmark 1973 decision that had established constitutional protections for abortion.\nState Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake who first introduced the legislation, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the Texas Supreme Court has said the state\u2019s 1925 anti-abortion statutes, which were challenged in Roe v. Wade, can go back into effect because they were never repealed by the state Legislature. Those statutes were written before the first IVF baby was born in 1978, but they also focus on pregnant women and outlawing acts in which an embryo is \u201cdestroyed in the woman\u2019s womb.\u201d\nTwo of Texas\u2019 most well-known anti-abortion groups \u2014 Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life \u2014 also say the state\u2019s laws and more recent definition of abortion should not affect or inhibit IVF treatment, even if they include the term embryo.\n\u201cAbortion is, according to Texas law, causing the death of the child, who is a child of a woman known to be pregnant,\u201d John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life, said pointing to a statute the Legislature amended a few years ago outlining what counts as an abortion.\n\u201cThere's also no such thing as an abortion outside of a woman's womb, so when you look at what's happening in the laboratory with assisted reproductive technology, that is not destruction of an embryo,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis language likely leaves IVF treatment intact, legal scholars told the Tribune. A district attorney could decide to try to test the issue by bringing a case against a fertility doctor, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But he added that challenging IVF doesn\u2019t appear to be an area \u201cripe\u201d for action in the anti-abortion movement.\nSeago said Texas Right to Life has concerns about the \u201cdestruction\u201d of \u201cexcessive\u201d embryos, particularly in medical research, but the issue is not one of its priorities for Texas\u2019 2023 legislative session. Instead, its priorities include enforcing existing laws against abortion and providing more support for pregnant women.\nRebecca Parma, a senior legislative associate for Texas Right to Life, previously said the group does eventually want to expand protections for embryos in IVF, but she also said it would not be in the upcoming legislative session.\n\u201cUltimately, we believe that all human life is valuable and deserves our legal protection from that beginning moment of fertilization, whether that occurs through normal means or through IVF. And so certainly we want those embryos who are created through the IVF process protected,\u201d she told Spectrum News1 in Austin. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s going to be a process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to happen next legislative session because obviously, IVF is something that is part of our culture and something that I think is pretty near and dear to a lot of people who desire families and desire children.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy O\u2019Donnell, a spokesperson for the Texas Alliance for Life, said the group had not finalized its legislative priorities yet, but said the group supported a law passed in 2017 requiring the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to post information on its website about embryo donations to other people to promote the option.\nA bill filed in 2019 aimed to ban state agencies from contracting with vendors affiliated with \u201cdestructive embryonic stem cell research,\u201d human cloning and abortions, but the legislation didn\u2019t gain traction.\nIn Louisiana, embryos are stored because the state outlaws the destruction of embryos unless they \u201cfail to develop further\u201d over a 36-hour period, Tipton said.\nCrawford, the co-founder of Fora Fertility in Austin, said most people keep their embryos for several years, and in some cases up to 20 years, but they may decide to discard them after reaching their desired family size or after a divorce or death of a partner. And while donating embryos to other patients can be an option, some people may not be comfortable with that, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a personal decision for most of us,\u201d she said. \u201cAn embryo does not exist as a person without a uterus to be implanted in, and that is what biology tells us all the time because many embryos do not implant and do not go on to become people.\u201d\nFor now, Crawford said she is advising her patients to not rush to transfer their IVF treatment to other states without abortion bans because \u201ctransporting embryos is not without risk of itself.\u201d Instead, she says patients should \u201csit tight\u201d and watchfully wait.\n\nJoin us at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in downtown Austin, and hear from 300+ speakers shaping the future of Texas including Joe Straus, Jen Psaki, Joaquin Castro, Mayra Flores and many others.
