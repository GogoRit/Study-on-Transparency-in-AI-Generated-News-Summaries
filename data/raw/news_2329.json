The president told the crowd the Democrats were\u00a0embracing \u201cradical and extreme positions\" on abortion and praised those attending the event, saying \u201cunborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\"   DOWNLOAD: The FOX 5 DC News app for local breaking news    47th March for Life rally to be held in the District Friday The 47th annual March for Life will be held in the District on Friday and President Donald Trump is scheduled to become the first sitting president to make remarks at the event.  \u201cEvery life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting,\" Trump said, prompting loud cheers from the many thousands attending the march. Critics, for their part, accused Trump of using the march to try to distract from his impeachment trial in the Senate. During an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 1999, Trump described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d but during his 2016 campaign, Trump said his views had changed and that he was now opposed to abortion, but for three exceptions: In the case of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. Last year, Trump joined the event via video satellite from the White House Rose Garden. The first march took place on the west steps of the Capitol in January 1974, the year after the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that established a woman's legal right to abortion. RELATED:\u00a0Trump to become first president to speak at the March for Life  Anti-abortion activists participate in the \"March for Life,\" an annual event to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the US, outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, January 18, 2019. (Ph  Expand Past presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure. They sent remarks for others to deliver, spoke via telephone hookup or invited organizers to visit the White House. According to Pew Research Center polling in 2019, roughly 6 in 10 Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Over time, though, both the Republican and Democratic parties have taken harder-line positions for and against abortion rights. RELATED:\u00a047th annual 'March for Life' rally to be held Friday in DC    DC preparing for the annual March for Life Thousands of pro-life activists are expected to march to\u00a0the Capital as part of the \u201cMarch for Life\u201d rally happening on Friday.
