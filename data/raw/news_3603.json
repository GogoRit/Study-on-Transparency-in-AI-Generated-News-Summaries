Newsroom, Oct 12, 2022 / 14:00 pm\nA Nebraska television station fired its news director and co-anchor after she collected signatures for a pro-life petition aimed at making her hometown of Curtis a sanctuary city for the unborn.\u00a0\nMelanie Standiford, a Nebraska native, told CNA in a phone interview that her firing from the NBC affiliate KNOP-TV, owned by the Atlanta-based Gray Television, came as a \u201csurprise.\u201d\nOn the day she was fired, Standiford recounted that her boss told her she was being cut from the company for \u201cpracticing partisan politics.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI said in response, \u2018partisan politics\u2019? I don\u2019t believe being pro-life is partisan,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are people from both sides of the aisle who believe both ways,\u201d she told CNA. \u201cIt\u2019s just right versus wrong in my mind.\u201d\nReport on ballot initiative prompts firing\nStandiford was fired after Flatwater Free Press reported that she had distributed a pro-life petition to fellow church members at St. John\u2019s Lutheran Church and another church in Curtis.\u00a0\nThe petition \u2014 for which Standiford collected 47 signatures \u2014 was circulated by town residents in order to call for a special vote in November to make Curtis a \u201csanctuary city for the unborn.\u201d\nCurtis, which has a population of 939 (2010), is one of six neighboring towns calling for an abortion ban within their city limits.\nStandiford\u2019s participation in the effort was reported by the Flatwater Free Press, a news website featuring investigative reporting on issues affecting Nebraska, in a story about the ballot initiative.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone she knows is Christian and anti-abortion, Standiford said in an interview with the Flatwater Free Press. In her mind, the ordinance would be so widely supported that it wouldn\u2019t be controversial,\u201d the article read.\u00a0\nStandiford told CNA that the reporter asked her whether or not it was \u201cethical\u201d for her as a journalist to collect signatures for the petition.\u00a0\n\u201cI told her, this is in the privacy of my church. This is something that I did, acting as a Christian, in the privacy of my church,\u201d Standiford said, adding that the reporter kept pressing her about ethics.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I said, \u2018You\u2019re probably right. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u2019 And that\u2019s the only quote she took from me.\u201d\nThe article as published read:\n\u201cWhen asked if it was appropriate for a reporter to cover an issue they were politically involved in, Standiford said: \u2018You\u2019re probably right, I probably, maybe shouldn\u2019t have even done that. But who knew it would be an issue?\u2019\u201d\nStandiford has reported on the abortion topic in the past from both sides. She said that even though she is pro-life, her reporting on the issue has always been \u201cbalanced.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the time that I covered it, I would interview those who were pro-choice, and even Planned Parenthood. My writing and storytelling was always very balanced,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe article was an attack; an attack directly on me,\u201d she added.\nThe day after the article came out, Standiford got news from her boss at KNOP-TV that she was being fired.\u00a0\n\u201cHe came in and handed me an envelope and said it would be my last day,\u201d she said, adding that she recorded the entire conversation.\n\u201cI asked him to tell me exactly why I was being fired \u2014 and he said, word for word, \u2018You\u2019re being fired for practicing partisan politics.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nStandiford told her boss in reply: \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was being political with that in my home church, sitting in the pews in my church.\u201d\u00a0\nFired for \u2018political activity\u2019\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nAccording to the North Platte Bulletin, Standiford is well-known in the area for her live news coverage, having worked at the station for five years. While serving as KNOP-TV\u2019s news director, she hired the station\u2019s entire staff. Standiford, who is a mother of nine, was awarded a gold medal from the Nebraska Broadcasters Association for covering children with special needs.\nIn a statement to the North Platte Bulletin, the general manager of KNOP, Shannon Booth, explained Standiford\u2019s termination.\n\u201cOur long-standing company policy encourages civic involvement among our employees, so long as such activities do not give the appearance of interfering with journalistic impartiality,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cIn furtherance of that qualification, KNOP\u2019s news personnel are not permitted, at any time and regardless of beliefs, to actively engage in any political activity for any candidate, party, or ballot initiative,\u201d Booth said.\nWhen CNA asked if Standiford was made aware of the policy regarding political activity at the time she was hired, Booth did not immediately respond.\nFor her part, Standiford said that she \u201cdidn\u2019t ever remember\u201d such a policy.\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe stuff that I\u2019m reading in the newspapers and hearing on the news, I\u2019m hearing for the first time. I\u2019ve never seen a handbook or anything,\u201d she said.\nAn advocate for life\nStandiford said that her town \u2014 nicknamed Easter City for the three large white crosses on the hill overlooking the town \u2014 widely supports protecting life.\nShe expects the sanctuary city policy to be passed and is hopeful for the city\u2019s future as a haven for the unborn and their mothers.\n\u201cA sanctuary city in Curtis has always been, for me, a no-brainer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnywhere that we can, we want to spread God\u2019s love, come beside women and let them know that they are loved.\u201d\nStandiford emphasized the importance of loving both mothers and their babies.\n\u201cWe want women to be safe; we want them to not have the mental trauma after an abortion that they\u2019ll live with for the rest of their lives,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPeople who think that we are hateful and don\u2019t care about women\u2019s rights have it backwards. We just want to love them,\u201d she concluded.\nAs to her future, Standiford told CNA that she is in contact with two lawyers who are looking at her case.\nIn the meantime, she has no regrets about being fired.\nOn Oct. 7 Standiford was appointed as temporary chair of the Frontier County Republican Party.\n\u201cThe Nebraska Republican Party not only welcomes her as a leader but stands with Standiford\u2019s strongly held belief of protecting the most innocent lives, the unborn. Melanie is a representation of what is needed as a County Chair and the courage it takes to stand for the values we hold as Republicans,\u201d NEGOP Chairman Eric Underwood said in a press release announcement.\n\n\nTags:\nPro-life, \nCatholic News, \nTelevision, \nChristian, \nJournalism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdie Heipel is a former Political Correspondent for CNA's Washington, D.C. bureau.
