And it filled me with hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro-lifers attend the March for Life rally on the National Mall on Jan. 21 in Washington, D.C.

For decades, I\u2019ve watched the massive annual Washington, D.C., protest from the other side of the country, where I live. What I\u2019ve seen from afar has always inspired me: Hundreds of thousands of people show up every year, committed to ending abortion on demand and protecting unborn life.\nBut I wasn\u2019t prepared for what I saw in person. More than anything else, I saw that the pro-life movement is incredibly young. The average age couldn\u2019t have been more than 30, maybe 35 at the most.\nIt filled me with hope: The fight to protect life will continue and even grow stronger. That\u2019s true regardless of whether the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year. Either way, there\u2019s a generation of determined young leaders prepared to keep the fight for life going. They\u2019ll always be there, whether the debate is happening in state capitols or still in D.C.\nThis realization swept over me from the moment I set foot on the National Mall, where the March for Life takes place. I was surrounded by tour buses from all over the country, and as each one opened its doors, an army of teens, 20-somethings, and 30-somethings usually poured out. As each bus pulled away, another one took its place, offloading more young women and men who know abortion is wrong and the right to life should be restored.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere were they coming from? Many, if not most, came from colleges. Their coats, scarves and winter caps were emblazoned with at least 150 university or college names, and those were just the ones I could see and count in the huge crowd. Hundreds of others came from churches, synagogues and different houses of worship, including some from as far away as my home state of California. Whether part of teenage youth groups or young-adult groups, they speak to a massive number of millennials and Gen Z\u2019ers committed to this cause.\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t expect to see this. As a man who has been part of this movement my entire life, I\u2019ve often heard phrases like the \u201cpro-life generation.\u201d But hearing it is one thing; seeing it is another. In the back of my mind, I guess I pictured the March for Life filled with middle-aged priests and pastors, aging monks and nuns, and people like me \u2014 old culture warriors who have been fighting the good fight since Roe v. Wade was forced on an unsuspecting country.\nTo be sure, these kinds of people were there, as evidenced by me. Yet, overall, the priests and pastors were younger than I expected \u2014 and almost always younger than me. Most of the monks and nuns looked like they weren\u2019t long out of college themselves. And for every old culture warrior I marched with (including longtime pro-life leader Sen. Rick Santorum) I was surrounded by two or more who were half my age, at least.\nKeep in mind: The March for Life is only one event on one day. While tens if not hundreds of thousands of young pro-life advocates showed up, there are tens of millions more spread across the country. They may not be the majority of their generations, as polls tend to show, but I\u2019d wager they\u2019re far more passionate about this issue than their peers. After all, I don\u2019t know of a pro-abortion event that consistently mobilizes so many people in the dead of winter. Only the pro-life movement achieves that feat, year after year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what starts on the National Mall doesn\u2019t stop there. The same young women and men who come out for the March for Life will be hard at work if the Supreme Court ends the Roe era in the Dobbs case, which could happen between now and summer. If the abortion issue is returned to the states, they\u2019ll bring the same youthful energy to local marches and legislative fights. They\u2019ll push for state laws that reflect the national consensus: America deserves better than abortion on demand \u2014 and unborn children deserve more protections than they have right now.\nEven if Roe somehow survives at the Supreme Court, the crowd I saw at the March for Life will keep coming back. The teenagers, 20-somethings, and 30-somethings I saw will continue to call for a country that once again respects the right to life. They\u2019ll keep up the fight as they grow older. And someday, like I am today, they\u2019ll be impressed and inspired by the new generations that carry on this noble cause.\n\n\nKeywords: \nmarch for life\nmarch for life 2022\ntim busch\npro-life
