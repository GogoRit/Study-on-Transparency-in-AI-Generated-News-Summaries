We are hopeful that relief will come swiftly and that Florida\u2019s abortion providers \u2014 including the state\u2019s two Planned Parenthood affiliates \u2014 will be able to resume offering the compassionate care our patients need. Until then, we will do everything in our power to ensure that patients have the resources to access care.\u201d\n\u201cWe are hopeful that the court will act quickly and restore Floridians\u2019 right to abortion and bodily autonomy,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\u201cEach day that the ban remains in effect, people across the state are deprived of the ability to determine what is best for their own lives and bodies. The deprivation of rights is compounded for Black and Latino communities; people with low incomes; and youth, who already experience higher social and economic barriers to accessing abortion. We will not stop fighting until the state Supreme Court permanently blocks the 15-week abortion ban,\u201d Johnson said.\nTrial court ruling\nA state trial judge ruled that the law, HB 5, passed last March and signed by Gov.
