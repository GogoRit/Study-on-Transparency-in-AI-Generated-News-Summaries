Since October 22nd, hundreds of thousands across Poland have been protesting\u2014in five hundred and eighty cities and towns, by one organizer\u2019s count. In some places, including the town of Ko\u015bcierzyna, population twenty-four thousand, more than ten per cent of residents have taken to the streets. The umbrella term for the protests is \u201cWomen\u2019s Strike,\u201d though it\u2019s not just women participating, and it\u2019s not exactly a strike. The demonstrations were sparked by a decision in the nation\u2019s Constitutional Court, in Warsaw, that would have further narrowed access to abortion in Poland. The government has since delayed implementing the decision, yet the protests go on. The goal now, it seems, is to bring down the government of the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), which has been in power since 2015.Abortion is allowed in Poland only if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, if the woman\u2019s life is in danger, or if the fetus is affected by severe congenital defects. The recent court decision, on October 22nd, eliminated the last of these three conditions from the list. Klementyna Suchanow, a prominent feminist and author, told me over Zoom, from Warsaw, that, at first, some activists felt conflicted about calling for demonstrations, for fear of exposing people to the risk of coronavirus infection. Still, on the 22nd, Suchanow, who is forty-six, made her way to the courthouse and found others gathering outside. \u201cI felt there was so much anger there it was about to erupt,\u201d she said. Protesters undertook a spontaneous march from the courthouse to the headquarters of the ruling party, and then to the house of the Party\u2019s leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. As word spread on social media, thousands more people joined the march over its three-hour duration.Marches, protests, and acts of civil disobedience have continued ever since. Suchanow and two other women, Marta Lempart and Agnieszka Czerederecka, have become the public faces of the protests, but, as Lempart told me over Zoom, they are acting not so much as leaders as they are the \u201chelp desk to people who want to organize protests.\u201d They supply visuals, suggest hashtags and slogans, and help raise money. \u201cBasically, my job now is this boring office work,\u201d she said.Lempart, who is forty-one, is a former government employee who became an opposition activist after the Law and Justice Party came to power. In 2016, when a ban on abortions in almost all circumstances was proposed as a bill in parliament, Lempart called for a protest in which Polish women marched through the streets of many cities and towns wearing black. (It was modelled on a women\u2019s strike staged in Iceland in 1975, when women stopped both paid and unpaid work.) Lempart\u2019s idea and subsequent organizing efforts drew thousands of people who had never been involved in political activism into the streets, in what became known as the \u201cblack protests.\u201d The demonstrations were large enough to prompt the parliament to table the bill, although they were nowhere close in scale to this year\u2019s actions.The umbrella term for the protests in Poland is \u201cWomen\u2019s Strike,\u201d though it\u2019s not just women participating, and it\u2019s not exactly a strike.Photograph by Wiktor Dabkowski / Picture Alliance / APAgnieszka Graff, a feminist scholar and activist, told me via Zoom, from Warsaw, that a Facebook group created to co\u00f6rdinate birthday celebrations for her child\u2019s sixth-grade classmates became a neighborhood protest-organizing group overnight. When Women\u2019s Strike called on protesters to block traffic in roundabouts (a type of direct action friendly to social distancing), Graff and another woman in her neighborhood created a Facebook event in which they invited women to come on \u201ca pleasant stroll in a residential area.\u201d Graff said that local organizers expected about fifty neighbors to come. About two thousand showed up in Graff\u2019s neighborhood, on October 26th; thousands of other protesters came to traffic circles all over Warsaw, bringing the city to a standstill. Bus and taxi-drivers joined in, with some changing the illuminated displays on the front of their buses to read \u201cWe are with you, girls.\u201d Organizers asked people to disperse after an hour, Graff said, but \u201cthere was no co\u00f6rdinating of this\u2014there is no way to exert control.\u201d The demonstration went on for five hours.When I spoke to Lempart on November 10th, she told me that it was no longer possible to use Facebook as an organizing tool, because the platform can\u2019t accommodate the scale of the protests: with half a million people following the Women\u2019s Strike Facebook page, no one is able to track or respond to comments. YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok have proved essential in helping young protesters organize; on TikTok, the hashtag #StrajkKobiet (Women\u2019s Strike) has generated more than two hundred and sixty-six million views. Too often, activist organizations \u201care like companies,\u201d Lempart said, with boards and management structures. Now protest is effectively leaderless. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working toward this for many years now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have got rid of the Homo sovieticus thinking.\u201dLempart was referring to the idea, fairly widespread among Polish intellectuals, that decades of Soviet rule produced a type of authoritarian personality, a person incapable of independent action and thought. Olga Tokarczuk, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, told me by e-mail, from the Polish countryside, that she also saw the protests as \u201ccivilizational change.\u201d Participants born after the fall of Communism \u201care the first generation from a Poland that\u2019s a member of the European Union; they have fully enjoyed the results of that. They have studied and traveled the world freely, they know how to live elsewhere. They speak foreign languages \u200b\u200band are very familiar with what human and civil rights mean in the 21st century.\u201dFor more than a quarter century, since the Eastern Bloc collapsed in 1989, Poland was a singular success story of post-Soviet transition and European integration\u2014economically, politically, and socially. While other former member countries of the Warsaw Pact stumbled, became mired in corruption, turned into mafia states, and descended into autocracy, Poland adopted a democratic constitution, built corresponding institutions, and saw moderately right- and left-wing governments succeed one another peacefully. At least part of this success is attributable to a long-standing understanding between pro-European forces and the Catholic Church, which has its roots in the coalition of intellectuals, trade-union activists, and the Church that formed the opposition to Communist rule in the nineteen-eighties and stepped into the vacuum left by the Communist Party in 1989. \u201cThe Church went along with Europe-ization and democratization in exchange for having its way on the things they feel strongly about,\u201d Graff said. \u201cAnd, of course, the things they feel most strongly about are women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d As a result, in the nineteen-nineties, Poland adopted some of the most restrictive abortion policies on the Continent.The golden age of Polish democracy ended in April, 2010, when a Polish Air Force plane carrying President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and his wife, the army chief of staff and various other military leaders, several cabinet members and high-level security officials, Catholic army chaplains, and members of parliament, among others, crashed, near the Russian city of Smolensk, where the Polish delegation was slated to take part in commemorative ceremonies. The plane crash shocked the country and split it into two roughly equal political and social camps. One camp remained committed to the project of democratization and European integration; they were also the people who saw the crash as an accident\u2014the conclusion reached so far by all teams who have investigated the disaster. The other camp, convinced that the crash was the result of a Russian plot, coalesced around the late President\u2019s surviving twin brother, Jaros\u0142aw, and a politics of resentment, confrontation, and extreme Euroskepticism. In 2015, the Law and Justice Party, co-founded by the Kaczy\u0144ski brothers, in 2001, won both the parliamentary and Presidential elections and went to work dismantling some of the democratic institutions constructed since 1989, most notably Poland\u2019s independent judiciary.The compromise between the Catholic Church and the liberals fell away. Poland became a major player in the international movement for so-called traditional values and against what the movement and the Polish government call \u201cgender ideology,\u201d an umbrella term for perceived threats to the traditional family which include reproductive rights, gender studies, and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Over the past few years, about a hundred Polish municipalities declared themselves \u201cL.G.B.T.-free zones,\u201d or, more bureaucratically, \u201czones free of L.G.B.T. ideology,\u201d a reference to the belief that equal rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people amount to indoctrination, particularly of small children.\u201cThe ruling party\u2019s main way of existing on the political scene is to create conflict,\u201d Magdalena Biejat, a member of parliament, told me over Zoom, from Warsaw. \u201cThey always have to find an enemy, someone they can exclude from the national community.\u201d L.G.B.T.Q. people, along with immigrants, have played this role for the past five years. (Biejat added that, since the onset of the COVID\u201119 pandemic, doctors have been cast in the role of scapegoat, as well.) Biejat, a thirty-eight-year-old sociologist who began her political career as an activist in 2015, belongs to Lewica Razem (Left Together), which is part of a forty-eight-person coalition in the four-hundred-and-sixty-member Sejm, the lower house of parliament. (Law and Justice is part of a conservative alliance that holds more than half the seats.) When we spoke, on the twelfth day of the protests, Biejat told me that she had been in the streets every day since October 23rd.Agnieszka Holland, a prominent film director who was once active in the dissident movement, told me over Zoom that she was watching the protests from her home in Brittany, where she was under stay-at-home orders recently imposed by the French government. \u201cI am following two fascinating TV series,\u201d she said\u2014\u201cthe Polish revolution and the American election.\u201d She had been thinking about the similarities between the two countries: both are extremely politically polarized; both suffer from vast wealth inequality; both have been \u201cdivided into two totally incompatible realities\u201d; in both, religious language and religious institutions play an outsized role in politics; both have systems that are \u201capparently democratic but very problematic. Poland has nothing as absurd as the Electoral College, but people don\u2019t feel represented.\u201d Her fear, she said, was that the demagogues in power in Poland are poised to change election law to make it impossible to dislodge them. Holland described Kaczy\u0144ski as a \u201cpopulist sadistic asshole with a narcissistic bent.\u201dLike most of the women who talked to me from Poland, Holland is calling the protests a revolution. \u201cIt\u2019s a feminist revolution because it is a real awakening of women, who are, in Poland, like in many countries of Europe, better educated but their career opportunities are very limited. They were resigned to the absurd abortion law for twenty-seven years.\u201dBiejat agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a revolution because of how we are starting to talk about abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a revolution in what we demand.\u201d Although the protests began as an outcry against further restrictions on abortion, protesters are now demanding \u201caccess to abortion during the first trimester, no questions asked,\u201d Biejat said. She added that this position \u201cused to be confined to feminist circles, but now it\u2019s hit the mainstream.\u201dThe protest organizer Marta Lempart says this fall\u2019s demonstrations are effectively leaderless\u2014something \u201cwe\u2019ve been working toward\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. for many years.\u201dPhotograph by Marcin Bruniecki / ShutterstockThe Women\u2019s Strike organizers are thinking well beyond abortion restrictions. They have called together a Consultative Council of experts, following the example of neighboring Belarus, where protests\u2014also leaderless and also led, in their way, by three women\u2014have been going on for three months. Suchanow said that the organizers had conducted a survey of protesters, identified thirteen topics of greatest concern to them, and created working groups of experts for every one, including abortion rights, education, work and the pandemic, health care, climate change, and the separation of church and state; there is also a group called No Pasar\u00e1n, which focusses on the \u201cdefascization of Poland.\u201d The formation of the Consultative Council projects a message of confidence\u2014back in 1988-89, the last time Poland saw protests on this scale, the Communist Party negotiated a power transfer with representatives of the movement.\u201cYes, it is revolution,\u201d Tokarczuk said, in response to an e-mail I had sent asking if she, too, would use the word. \u201cIn a very painful and dramatic (sometimes also funny) way the old world is melting now and a new one is crystallizing.\u201d Some of that change is evident on the level of language. One of the most popular banners, \u201cJeba\u0107 PiS,\u201d means \u201cFuck Law and Justice\u201d; another, \u201cLibert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Wypierdalajt\u00e9,\u201d translates as \u201cLiberty, Equality, Get the Fuck Out\u201d (as though pronounced with a French accent). Although Polish speakers can pride themselves on expert and creative use of profanity, putting curse words on political banners is a novelty, jarring for some. (In a tongue-in-cheek nod to expectations of public decency, some protesters carry banners emblazoned with nothing but eight asterisks\u2014five for \u201cJeba\u0107\u201d and three for \u201cPiS.\u201d) \u201cThe first time I saw a banner on the screen that read \u2018Get the fuck out,\u2019 I was shocked by the word, so clearly painted in red letters in public space,\u201d Tokarczuk wrote. \u201cBut I got used to it quickly and decided that this anger couldn\u2019t be expressed any better. That when in society communication between two sides breaks down, when people do not hear and understand each other, when their words come from entirely different idiolects, then only the curse words remain. It is a radical, instantaneous language that will change as things move to the next stage: negotiation, new order making, and new rules.\u201d\u201cSome people are saying it\u2019s kind of weird that we have a feminist movement that doesn\u2019t use the word \u2018sisterhood\u2019 but uses \u2018fuck\u2019 all the time,\u201d Graff said. The biggest taboo, however, is being shattered by protesting against the Church itself. Protesters have marched to churches and bishop residences; they have painted protest slogans outside churches; and, in at least one instance, protesters shouted at a priest. Any of these events would have been unimaginable just a month ago. A major source of anger against the Church, as in so many other countries, is its failure to address evidence of widespread sexual abuse of children by priests, laid out in a documentary called \u201cTell No One,\u201d which was posted on YouTube last year by its author, Tomasz Sekielski, and has been watched nearly twenty-four million times. Graff said that people have been officially leaving the Church in droves (a process that can involve submitting a document to the parish in which the person was baptized). Some Western observers have interpreted this movement as a sign that the younger generation of Poles is secular, but Graff objected: \u201cThey are not secular\u2014they are pissed off.\u201d Indeed, they may be so angry that they are becoming secular.Among all the people I spoke with about the ongoing protests, it was the youngest interlocutor who struck the most cautious note. \u201cI would love to call it a revolution, because I think that\u2019s what we need right now,\u201d Martyna Grygierek, an eighteen-year-old L.G.B.T.Q. and climate activist, told me over Zoom, from Krak\u00f3w. Grygierek moved to Krak\u00f3w a few months ago to attend university, though it is fully remote, from an area that was declared an \u201cL.G.B.T.-free zone\u201d around the time that Grygierek was coming out. \u201cI am living in a place where, in theory, I\u2019m not allowed to exist,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a statement than an actual law,\u201d Grygierek added, but, still, \u201cit\u2019s fucked up. There are L.G.B.T. people who are scared.\u201dSo many people were flooding the streets in Krak\u00f3w, and the police did little but threaten them\u2014one popular local slogan is \u201cYou can\u2019t lock us all up.\u201d But Grygierek felt that police had grown more menacing in recent days, and feared that law enforcement would crush the demonstrations if the numbers of protesters dwindled. Others, including Lempart, agreed that a crackdown is more likely than the overthrow of the Polish government. But, whatever happens, Lempart said, \u201cnothing will be the same.\u201dMasha Gessen, a staff writer, is a distinguished professor at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.More:PolandFascismAbortionFeminismWomen\u2019s RightsProtestsCatholic ChurchDailyOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top stories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.E-mail addressSign upBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
