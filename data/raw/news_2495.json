I once had a conversation with a committed and enthusiastic evangelical about a flight from Europe to the USA. On the way I had seen from the window an ocean of little icebergs. I mentioned to this person that it was evidence of global warming, and the person said to me, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in that, do you?\u201d I said back, \u201cI don\u2019t have to believe it, I saw it!\u201d The person snarled in a way that was clear I was duped.\nMost churches seemingly show very little regard for environmental issues as a concern for serious thinking Christians. Environment is not found in most books about the Christian life or discipleship studies. It\u2019s not part of our \u201cintroduction\u201d to what Christians believe.\nNow take a look at Sandra Richter\u2019s new book, Stewards of Eden: What Scripture Says about the Environment and Why It Matters.\nI wonder if you\u2019d look around at your church\u2019s materials on the Christian life or in your own library and ask yourself what\u2019s available on environment. Think about it, it\u2019s the first major instruction from God in the Bible: take care of this good world I\u2019ve made for you!\nWhy don\u2019t many care? Richter gives three:\nLet\u2019s start where she does, with politics \u2013 partisan politics:\n\nOne reason is certainly politics. Not kingdom politics, but American and international politics. I think that most would concur that the traditional political allies of the church are not the traditional political allies of environmental concern. If you are pro-life, it is assumed that you cannot also be pro-environment. If you are a patriot, you supposedly cannot also be a conservationist.\nOr to be more forthright: in the United States, if you are an environmentalist, it is assumed that you are a Democrat \u2013 and Democrats, supposedly, are not pro-life. If you are a Republican, it is assumed that you cannot also be pro-environment. In other words, somehow environmental advocacy has been pigeonholed into a particular political profile and has become guilty by association.\n\nRichter\u2019s right here. As with so many moral topics or ethical concerns, politics in the sense of taking sides in a partisan manner has taken over. \n\r\n\t\t\tIn other words, somehow environmental advocacy has been pigeonholed into a particular political profile and has become guilty by association.\r\n\t\t\n\nIs it then the general GOP persuasion of evangelicals that makes them unconcerned with the environment? I ask this as question.\nHer second reason is our privilege: we often simply don\u2019t see or experience the impact of our economic life on the planet.\nTrees in Haiti were stripped from the land and it turned huge acreage into a pit of mud. \n\nTrees in Kenya were stripped from mountains and damaged miles and miles.\nPollution of waters.\n\nImage: Cover photo\n\n\nPollution of the air.\nProduction of plastics that ruin the ocean\u2019s biological balances.\nWe are sheltered from most of these most of the time. We don\u2019t experience or see them up close enough that they impact us. \nThird, our posture has far too often \u201cyou can\u2019t take it with you\u201d and \u201cit will all burn anyway\u201d and \u201cwe must care more about souls than seas.\u201d\n\nThe end result? The church, particularly the evangelical wing of the church, has inadvertently dismissed the issue of environmental stewardship as peripheral (or even alien) to the theological commitments of the Bible.\n\nIf you want a responsible and accessible read, one that is as good for home Bible studies and Sunday School classes as it is for personal reading, please buy Sandy Richter\u2019s book and help us get beyond the politics, the privilege and the posturing.\nThe first instruction from God. Think about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks & ResourcesA Church Called Tov: Forming a Goodness Culture That Resists Abuses of Power and Promotes HealingLaura Barringer; Scot McKnight\nTyndale Elevate2020-10-06256 pp., 16.49\n\nView More\n\nFree NewslettersSign up to receive monthly updates from Jesus Creed delivered to your inbox:\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\n\nJesus Creed is a part of CT's \r\n\tBlog Forum.
