In 1988, members of the Pro-Life Action League and Citizens for a Pro-Life Society, both sponsoring organizations of the Day of Remembrance, uncovered the remains of thousands of aborted children in the loading doc of Vital Med labrotory in Northbrook, Illinois.  On August 6, 1988, 721 of those babies were given a proper burial at Roselawn Cemetery, Tallahassee, FL.\n\nNational Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t  \tPro-life Americans set to memorialize children lost to abortion with national day of remembrance\n\t  \t\n\t  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfont size\n\ndecrease font size\n\n\n\nincrease font size\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t09 September, 2020\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWritten by\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLisa Bourne\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in\nNEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life Americans across the U.S. are set to come together Saturday, September 12 at the gravesites of tens of thousands of aborted children and other sites dedicated in their memory for the eighth annual National Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children.\nA solemn prayer vigil, the Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children is an opportunity for pro-life advocates to give a pro-life witness and honor the many lives lost to abortion.\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\nThe National Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children is a cooperative effort between Citizens for a Pro-Life Society, Priests for Life and the Pro-Life Action League.\u00a0\nThe event uses the #RememberTheAborted hashtag.\n\u201cHaving a memorial service where these babies are buried reminds us that abortion is not merely about beliefs, but about bloodshed,\u201d said Priests for Life National Director Fr. Frank Pavone, co-director for the National Day of Remembrance, adding, \u201cnot just about viewpoints, but victims.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cHaving a memorial service where these babies are buried reminds us that abortion is not merely about beliefs, but about bloodshed\u201d Fr. Frank Pavone\nThe first Day of Remembrance was held on Saturday, September 14, 2013.\nThe inaugural event was a success, organizers say, with over 100 memorial services conducted at locations all over the country. This included 38 gravesites of aborted children, and the event has continued to grow each year since.\nCurrently there are 177 memorial services scheduled nationwide for the 2020 Day of Remembrance.\n\u201cThe graves of these victims are scattered across America,\u201d said Monica Miller, director of Citizens for a Pro-life Society and co-director of the National Day of Remembrance, \u201cgraves of sorrow and graves of indictment on a nation that permitted the killing of the innocent.\u201d\nLocal volunteer leaders are needed to assist the national team in coordinating the prayer vigils throughout the country, with the national team giving guidance and resources throughout the process. Specifics on hosting a memorial service are available HERE.\u00a0\nThere are presently 54 gravesites of aborted children, with local leaders needed for some of them.\n\u201cIt's sobering to realize that grave markers for the unborn victims of abortion list only a date of burial,\u201d said Eric Scheidler, Pro-Life Action League executive director and National Day of Remembrance co-director. \u201cThey have no birthdays because they were never allowed to be born.\u201d\nTweet This: \u201cIt's sobering to realize that grave markers for the unborn victims of abortion list only a date of burial\u201d - Eric Scheidler\nFor more information on the\u00a0National Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children click HERE. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nNational Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children\nCitizens for a ProLife Society\nPriests for Life\nProLife Action League\nFrank Pavone\nMonica Miller\nEric Scheidler\n#RememberTheAborted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa Bourne\n\nLisa Bourne is Managing Editor of Pregnancy Help News and Content Writer for Heartbeat International.
