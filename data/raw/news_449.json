Mike Parson, who had voiced his support for an earlier version of the bill on Wednesday. \nAlthough the bill does include exemptions for medical emergencies, like Alabama\u2019s horrific bill, it will not exclude pregnancies caused by rape or incest. \nDoctors who perform abortions after the eight-week mandate will face up to 15 years in prison. Women will not be legally prosecuted, however that says nothing about their emotional, mental and overall physical health. \nRepublican Senate handler Sen. Andrew Koenig touted the bill as \u201cone of the strongest\u201d abortion bills yet passed in the United States. This is also given that Missourians who want abortions already have to go through a 72-hour waiting period to secure medical attention (narrowing that 8-week gap even more), with only one abortion clinic existing in the state, CBS notes. \n\u201cSo much of this bill is just shaming women into some kind of complacency that says we are vessels of pregnancy rather than understanding that women\u2019s lives all hold different stories,\u201d Democratic Sen. Jill Schupp said while arguing against the bill on the floor.\nHowever, unlike Alabama\u2019s bill, Missouri\u2019s bill would only start to take effect if  Roe v. Wade \u2013 the landmarking ruling which legalized abortions  \u2013 is overturned.\nIf the courts block Missouri\u2019s proposed ban as it is, the bill has created room for less restrictive limits, ranging from 14 to 20 weeks.\nRepublican House Speaker Elijah Haahr said that the legislation wasn\u2019t built to challenge Roe \u2013 unlike Alabama\u2019s bill, where Republicans in the state have clearly stated that was their intention. \n\u201cThis is not a piece of legislation that is designed for a challenge,\u201d Haahr said. \u201cThis is the type of legislation that is designed to withstand a challenge and to actually save lives in our state.\u201d\nTOPICS:\u00a0  abortion bill abortion law Missouri\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION \nOur Company\nCustomer Service\nEssence Ventures\nChange Your Address\nContact Us\nJob Opportunities\nInternships\nMedia Kit\n\n\n\n \n\nSUBSCRIBE \nNewsletters\nGive a Gift of ESSENCE\nMagazine Tablet Edition\n\n\n FOLLOW US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE ON ESSENCE \nHome\nLove\nCelebrity\nBeauty\nHair\nFashion\nESSENCE festival\n\n\n \n\n\nESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.\nEssence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.
