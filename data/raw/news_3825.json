Reports from numerous countries have shown that women are disproportionately and uniquely impacted by the coronavirus across every sphere, from health and the economy to security and social protection. \nAccording to U.N. data, 60 percent of women\u2019s employment is in the informal economy with limited protection. This means women are often overlooked by bailout programs seeking to reinvigorate the economy while being particularly vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity, according to Megan O'Donnell, assistant director of the Center for Global Development\u2019s gender program. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen evidence that women\u2019s businesses are more likely to close compared with men\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - Vicky Li Yip sets up a bubble machine for her children, left to right, Kelsey, 8, Toby, 10 and Jesse, 5, outside their home, July 10, 2020, in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n\nAnd with children out of school, women are picking up even more caregiving responsibilities, forcing many to step back from the workplace and exacerbating the economic consequences of the unpaid care work that women disproportionately perform. Moreover, women face an increase in domestic violence as a result of lockdowns, and find less access to sexual and reproductive health as limited resources are diverted to the pandemic. \nWomen also make up 70 percent of healthcare workers worldwide risking their lives to save others, according to the World Health Organization. \n\u201cAdvancing women's economic participation in the midst of the COVID crisis will require attention to these issues \u2014 something the W-GDP initiative should take into account to deliver on its promise,\u201d said Jamille Bigio, senior fellow in the Women and Foreign Policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. \nWomen as economic drivers \n W-GDP believes that women should not be viewed as victims who are waiting for somebody to come and save them, but should be seen as the drivers of economic recovery from the pandemic, said Kelley Currie, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues. \n\u201cWe are focused on how the barriers to women's participation can be removed so that women can be full participants in the economy and how they can drive prosperity and growth,\u201d said Currie. \nStill some observers question whether the initiative\u2019s limited scope and relatively small budget of $100 million under the W-GDP Fund will be enough to meet the challenge. \nThough W-GDP has grown steadily from its initial $50 million allocation, it\u2019s nowhere near the tens of billions invested in PEPFAR  for example, said Megan O'Donnell, referring to the initiative to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic launched by President George W. Bush in 2003. \n\u201cTo match the scale of the problem, W-GDP will need to be able to support at-scale solutions,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, adding that the likelihood of success will increase if those implementing the initiative have increased financial resources at their disposal. \nReproductive health \nW-GDP has been lauded for ensuring that a range of U.S. government agencies including USAID, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Development Finance Corporation, Peace Corps and others feed into its three-pillar strategy and report their progress according to a standard set of metrics. But its biggest criticism remains that the initiative, in line with broader Trump administration policies, ignores investments that support women\u2019s health, sexual and reproductive rights, and mitigate gender-based violence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - President Donald Trump speaks with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, July 31, 2020.\n\n\n\nIn his first week in office, President Donald Trump reinstated and expanded the Global Gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy, that prohibits U.S. global health assistance organizations from providing information, resources, or services on safe abortions.\nIn 2018, the State Department removed reproductive health from its annual country reports, and in May 2020, USAID acting administrator John Barsa sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General demanding that sexual and reproductive healthcare be removed from the U.N.'s COVID-19 response plan. \n\u201cAll the collaboration in the world cannot erase the fact that the overall women\u2019s rights legacy of the Trump administration is one that is anti-women and anti-rights,\u201d said Amanda Klasing, acting co-director of the women's rights division at Human Rights Watch. \u201cIf the Trump administration keeps actively attacking sexual and reproductive rights at every opportunity and failing to address gender-based violence, the W-GDP successes are just on paper.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFILE - U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues Kelley Currie attends an event celebrating the anniversary of the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) initiative at the State Department in Washington, Feb. 12, 2020.\n\n\n\nResponding to VOA\u2019s question, Kelley Currie, the State Department\u2019s ambassador-at-large for global women\u2019s issues, defended the initiative. \nW-GDP is \u201cvery focused\u201d and \u201cvery consensus-based,\u201d Currie said. \u201cWe believe that this is the best way that we can use the resources we have to address the barriers that are holding back women.\u201d \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvanka Trump Launches \u2018Farmers to Families\u2019 Food Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvitation to Ivanka Trump Draws Backlash at Big Tech Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvanka Trump: Whistleblower's Motives More Important Than ID\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorocco's Female Landowners Give Ivanka Trump a Warm Welcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvanka Trump Defends Goya Post that Watchdogs Call Unethical\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Entrepreneurship news \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Study Reports Widespread Forced Labor Abuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of Japan Scraps Radical Policy, Makes First Rate Hike in 17 Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Price Key Reason Some Voters Frustrated by US Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Buying Costs Could Fall in Big US Real Estate Group Settlement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservers: US Investments in Philippines Seen Easing Reliance on China\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Day in Photos \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS News\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\nAll About America\n\n\nSilicon Valley & Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThe Americas\n\n\nEast Asia Pacific\n\n\nEurope\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOA Programs\n\n\nSpecial projects\n\n\nDay in Photos\n\n\nPress Freedom\n\n\nRefugees\n\n\nVOA News on Iran\n\n\nVOA News on China\n\n\nArts & Culture\n\n\nEconomy & Business\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nExtremism Watch\n\n\nStudent Union\n\n\nVOA Connect\n\n\n52 Documentary\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From VOA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOAAfrica.com Programs\n\n\nVOA Learning English\n\n\nPolygraph.info\n\n\nEditorials\n\n\nSatellite schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use & Privacy Notice\n\n\nAbout VOA\n\n\nGet VOA+\n\n\nVOA Around the World\n\n\nContact VOA\n\n\nMedia Relations\n\n\nUsage Requests\n\n\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nXS\nSM\nMD\nLG\n\n\n\n"
