Julia Brownley, D-Calif., shown here at a hearing in 2018, called on VA Secretary Robert Wilkie \"to prioritize reproductive care and expand medical care to include abortion and abortion counseling.\u201d (Stars and Stripes)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Department of Veteran Affairs\u2019 nearly 30-year abortion ban received a critical look from lawmakers Tuesday, some of whom argued it was a \u201charsh\u201d inequity for a growing number of female veterans.\nA law passed by Congress in 1992 prohibits the VA from performing abortions or counseling women about them. On a VA webpage about women\u2019s health services, the department states, \u201cPlease note that we cannot, by law, provide abortion services.\u201d\nRep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., juxtaposed the ban with the U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday to strike down a controversial Louisiana abortion law that critics argued would\u2019ve closed two of the state\u2019s three abortion clinics. Brownley said the legal battle \u201chighlighted how denying veterans health care within a system they rely on imposes prohibitive, geographic and financial barriers on women.\u201d\n\n \u201cI call on Secretary Wilkie to prioritize reproductive care and expand medical care to include abortion and abortion counseling,\u201d Brownley said.\nShe introduced the Reproductive Health Information for Veterans Act earlier this year, which would require the VA to provide abortion services.\nBrownley, a member of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, held a hearing Tuesday to address gaps in reproductive health care for female veterans, including the ban on abortion services, limited access to infertility care and a policy that requires veterans to provide copayments for birth control.\nKayla Williams, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and the former director of the Center for Women Veterans, said Congress would need to take action on all three issues, rather than relying on the VA to intercede.\nThe VA \u201chas neglected to take action for so long now that I believe they require congressional attention,\u201d Williams said.\nWilliams focused on the abortion ban, in particular, arguing it was an \u201cappalling\u201d inequity for veterans. Women who benefit from other federal systems \u2013 including Medicare, Tricare, the Indian Health Service and the federal prison system \u2013 have more access to abortion services, Williams said.\n\n \u201cHowever we feel about abortion, we should not deny it to women veterans just because they use the VA and take away their ability to make important decisions about their health and futures,\u201d she said.\nRep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, opposed any effort to lift the ban.\n\u201cI will oppose any effort the VA has to expand abortion,\u201d Roe said. \u201cI want to make that part of the record right now. I will oppose that with every effort in my body. I think we need to change hearts and minds.
