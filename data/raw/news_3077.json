According to a December 2021 survey by Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core, 10 percent of Americans say they believe getting a COVID-19 vaccine conflicts with their religious beliefs.\nAmong their objections is that in developing or testing their vaccines, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson all used cell lines in various ways that trace their origins to aborted fetuses from the 1970s and 1980s. The most commonly used in medical laboratories are known as HEK293 and PER.C6.\n\nBishop Joseph Strickland of the Diocese of Tyler, Texas, has defied Catholic Church hierarchy by taking a hardline stance against COVID-19 vaccines because of the controversial cell lines.\n\u201cI WILL NOT take an abortion tainted vaccine, I wish other bishops had joined me months ago,\u201d Strickland tweeted in April 2021. But he linked from the tweet to an article from the website Catholic Culture, which promoted Novavax\u2019s shot in a separate December 2020 post as \u201capparently developed and produced without any involvement of fetal tissues.\u201dNovavax CEO Stanley Erck has expressed hope his vaccine could win over vaccine skeptics in general. \u201cIn the US, the primary market I think in 2022 is going to be to supply a vaccine, our normal two-dose regimen, to a lot of people who have been hesitant to get other vaccines,\u201d Erck told CNN in November.\nSome prominent anti-vaccine activists, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have been cautious but notably less hostile toward Novavax because it uses protein-based technology, a more traditional approach than the mRNA-based vaccines created by Moderna and Pfizer. The animal cells employed in its development, Novavax notes, come from moths.\nThe company claims the shot was up to 90 percent effective in preventing the original strain of COVID-19 and announced in December that it also generates an immune response against the omicron variant.\nAbby Johnson, a prominent anti-abortion activist who has repeatedly condemned many COVID-19 vaccines because of their connection to fetal cell lines, celebrated Novavax\u2019s approach.\n\u201cIt is my understanding that (Novavax) has been used successfully in several countries with a high efficacy rate,\u201d she told RNS in a statement. \u201cIt is also my understanding that there are not any ethical concerns regarding Novavax, which is hopeful for pro-lifers who have avoided the vaccine due to those objections.\u201d\nScientists and faith leaders have dismissed criticism of HEK293 and other cell lines, explaining that the cells used today are clones many steps removed from the original tissue and not present in the mRNA-based vaccines themselves.\nBoth the Vatican and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops have issued statements declaring it morally permissible for Catholics to get Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson shots despite use of the cell lines.\nTexas pastor Robert Jeffress, onetime adviser to former-President Donald Trump, has similarly derided the cell line argument, pointing out that they are used to develop a host of common medicines.\n\u201cChristians who are troubled by the use of a fetal cell line for the testing of the vaccines would also have to abstain from the use of Tylenol, Pepto Bismol, Ibuprofen, and other products that used the same cell line if they are sincere in their objection,\u201d Jeffress told the Associated Press in September.Yet religious arguments have continued to crop up among those who oppose vaccine mandates. A major protest in Washington, DC, last month began with a musical number that characterized vaccine mandates as \u201ca war on religion.\u201d What\u2019s more, vaccine controversy has spurred fusions of Christian nationalism and anti-vaccine rhetoric.\nNovavax\u2019s distance from the cell lines might not be enough for some, however. Asked about the Novavax shot, Sarah Quale, president of the anti-abortion Personhood Alliance Education, pointed to a scientific study of Novavax\u2019s vaccine that referred to the use of HEK-293 cells.\n\u201cThe Personhood Alliance\u2019s official position on vaccine ethics asserts that the use of aborted fetal cell lines at any point in vaccine creation is morally unacceptable,\u201d Quale said via email. \u201cAll currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the US used aborted fetal cell lines at some point in the design, production, and/or testing processes.\u201d\nPressed about the study, a Novavax spokesperson said the company \u201cdid not use HEK-293 cells in the testing of NVX-CoV2373.\u201d\n\u201cThe reference in the Science paper to HEK293 cells was based on well-established scientific knowledge, did not include our vaccine protein, and is completely independent of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine development,\u201d the spokesperson said in a followup email.\nQuale remained skeptical, noting Novavax has \u201cnot made information available as to which cells were used in testing.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Johnson noted that while any use of the cell lines would change her opinion of the shot, she\u2019s \u201cnot seeing any evidence that they were, and Novavax is denying they were used.\u201d\nStacy Trasancos, who recently left her post at the St. Philip Institute of Catechesis and Evangelization and co-leads the anti-abortion group Children of God for Life, both of which are tied to Bishop Strickland, called Novavax\u2019s initial response \u201cconfusing,\u201d but did not immediately respond to the company\u2019s clarification.\nWhether Novavax\u2019s efforts will be enough to win over Strickland or those who agree with him is an open question.\nThe marriage of anti-vaccine sentiment and opposition to vaccine mandates has emerged as a political force all its own, and many who oppose vaccines root their views in a variety of conspiracy theories, not just faith. Even if it does convert some of the unvaccinated, it\u2019s unclear if the shift would be significant.But as the US nears 930,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control, any increase in vaccinations may make a difference.\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionCoronavirusMedicine and HealthPro-Life MovementScienceUnited StatesVaccines\n\nPosted by:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJack Jenkins - Religion News Service\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 18, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead These NextRelated\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAmerican Bible Society Will Close Its $60 Million Museum\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Bible museum on Independence Mall in Philadelphia was open less than three years and had attracted fewer visitors than projected. \r\n\t\t\nEmily Belz\nTrending\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter 140 Years, Alliance University Will Close\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFormerly Nyack College, the school was in bad financial shape for several years.
