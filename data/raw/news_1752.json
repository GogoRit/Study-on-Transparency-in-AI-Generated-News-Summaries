Kim Reynolds signed the measure into law. That means abortion is once again legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the courts assess the new law\u2019s constitutionality.The new law prohibits almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the measure in a rare, all-day special session last week, prompting a legal challenge by the ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic. Judge Joseph Seidlin held a hearing on the matter Friday, but said he would take the issue under advisement \u2014 just as Reynolds signed the bill into law about a mile away.\n\nAbortion providers said they scrambled last week to fit in as many appointments as possible before the governor put pen to paper, preemptively making hundreds of calls to prepare patients for the uncertainty and keeping clinics open late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill shelved that sought changes to Iowa law outlining penalties for terminating a pregnancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP Player of the Week: Caitlin Clark helps Iowa win third straight Big Ten Tournament title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA century before Caitlin Clark, 6-on-6 basketball players in Iowa were blazing trail for her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReynolds swiftly put out a statement underscoring her intention to fight the issue all the way to the state Supreme Court.\u201cThe abortion industry\u2019s attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruling Monday does specify that while the law is temporarily paused, the state\u2019s Board of Medicine should proceed with creating rules for enforcement, as the law specifies. That way the guidance for health care providers would be well defined if the law were to be in effect in the future.There are limited circumstances under the law that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality \u201cincompatible with life;\u201d or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman.\n\nSeidlin specified that his ruling today hinges on the \u201cundue burden\u201d test, which is an intermediate level of scrutiny that requires laws do not create a significant obstacle to abortion.The state Supreme Court, in its latest rulings on the issue, said that undue burden remains in effect \u201cwith an invitation to litigate the issue further,\u201d Seidlin wrote. \u201cThis, perhaps, is the litigation that accepts the invitation.\u201dUsing that standard, abortion advocates are likely right to say the new law violates Iowans\u2019 constitutional rights, Seidlin said, which led him to grant the temporary block.Lawyers for the state argued \u2014 and will likely continue to argue \u2014 that the law should be analyzed using rational basis review, the lowest level of scrutiny to judge legal challenges.\u201cWe are deeply relieved that the court granted this relief so essential health care in Iowa can continue,\u201d said Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director of the Iowa City-based Emma Goldman Clinic, in a statement. \u201cWe are also acutely aware that the relief is only pending further litigation and the future of abortion in Iowa remains tenuous and threatened.\u201d\n\nMost Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings, as is now the case in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
