The U.S. Food and Drug Administration eased restrictions on abortion medications during the pandemic. Some lawmakers want to reverse that. Charlie Neibergall/The Associated Press \n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weaken or topple its nearly 50-year-old abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade, giving states wide latitude to restrict the procedure. \u00a0\nBut most legislatures will be adjourned by then, and anti-abortion lawmakers aren\u2019t waiting to address what they expect will be one result of widespread limits on clinical abortions: spiraling demand for medication abortions. \nSince January, legislators in at least 20 states have proposed bills that would restrict or ban access to abortion pills approved more than two decades ago by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \u00a0\nThis year\u2019s flurry of bills was spurred in part by an FDA ruling during the coronavirus pandemic that eliminated a long-standing requirement that patients consult with prescribers and pick up the pills in person. \nUnder the FDA\u2019s temporary ruling, which was made permanent in December, patients for the first time can consult with prescribers via telehealth and receive the pills by mail. \u00a0\nIn response, lawmakers in Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Tennessee quickly proposed bills that would reinstate the old FDA rules. \nThe bills would require patients to pick up the pills at a medical facility rather than receive them in the mail, and in South Dakota, take the pills under observation by a medical professional. \nLawmakers in Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Missouri proposed bills that would ban telehealth consultations and instead require one or more in-person visits to a medical facility to receive abortion pills.\nOutright bans on dispensing or using the FDA-approved medications have been proposed in Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, South Dakota, Illinois, Washington and Wyoming.\nLawmakers in 13 states also proposed legislation requiring physicians to tell patients that medication abortions can be reversed by administering doses of progesterone, a controversial treatment the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u00a0says is not based on science and does not meet clinical standards. \nLast year, Indiana enacted a law prohibiting medication abortions after 10 weeks of pregnancy, and Texas banned medication abortion after seven weeks of pregnancy. \nThe FDA approves use of the pills during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. But doctors and abortion rights advocates say many patients have successfully used the medications later. \nOriginally called RU-486, a drug called mifepristone was developed by a French drugmaker in 1980 as a method of terminating an early pregnancy by blocking the natural production of progesterone, a hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy.\nFrance became the first Western nation to approve the pills in 1988. But the FDA didn\u2019t follow suit until 2000, when it approved mifepristone when used in combination with a drug called misoprostol, which causes uterine\u00a0contractions to expel the embryo.\u00a0\nAlthough widely used elsewhere by then, the drugs were slow to take off in the United States. \nBy 2017 medication abortion had gained momentum, representing 39% of all abortions in the United States. In 2020, the non-surgical method accounted for 54% of abortions, according to a February report by the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy and research organization. \nWomen\u2019s health experts predict that if more states enact abortion bans, the number of people who seek to end their pregnancies outside of the formal health care system will soar.\nTexas last year banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a statute the U.S. Supreme Court let stand while abortion supporters pursued a case against licensing officials who might discipline health care providers for performing abortions later in pregnancy. \u00a0\nLast week, the Texas Supreme Court upheld the law, which includes a provision that thwarts federal lawsuits against state officials by allowing anyone who is not a state or local official to sue a person who provides an abortion or \u201cengages in conduct that aids or abets\u201d one. \nIn the first week after the Texas law took effect in September, medication abortions in the state increased more than twelvefold, according to researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.\nLegal Strategies\nStates first enacted laws restricting abortion pills in 2010, two years after Planned Parenthood began offering the medications in small towns in the Midwest through telehealth consultations with medical professionals based in larger cities. \nOklahoma enacted the first law, requiring the provider and the patient to be in the same room. Then in 2011, six more states\u2014Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee\u2014adopted similar requirements. \nAs of last year, more than half of all states had either banned telehealth for medication abortion or required one or more in-person visits. This year, conservative lawmakers are doubling down on those laws, said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute. \u00a0\n\u201cAs abortion opponents watched what was going on with telehealth during the pandemic, it became apparent to them that access to medication abortion was expanding,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing this year and last is a reaction to that.\u201d \nIn addition, she said, \u201cwith all signs pointing to the [Supreme Court] substantially damaging or even overturning abortion rights, it\u2019s a way of hedging their bets and not putting all of their political capital into enacting new abortion bans that may or may not hold up in court.\u201d \nAt least 21 states already have abortion bans on the books that could be enforced if Roe is overturned, according to Guttmacher. \u00a0\nClarke Forsythe, senior counsel at Americans United for Life, which opposes abortion rights, agreed that state lawmakers would be wise not to put their efforts into enacting new abortion bans, since it is still uncertain what the high court will decide in the Mississippi case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, that it heard last fall. \nInstead, he said, he expects more states to focus on restricting medication abortion now that the FDA has relaxed regulations. \n\u201cShort of a state trying to prohibit a chemical abortion altogether, I would expect that limits on chemical abortion will be enforceable no matter how the Dobbs decision goes,\u201d Forsythe said.\nOnline Pills\nIn the District of Columbia and the 23 states that allow the use of telemedicine for prescribing abortion pills, patients can obtain the medication through the mail using a variety of online services.\nIn states where telehealth abortion medication is legal, prices range from $150 to $375, with discounts for those who are unable to pay and the possibility of charging the fees to Medicaid or private insurance.\nWomen in states that prohibit telehealth for medication abortion also can acquire the pills online through an offshore medical service called Aid Access, started by a Dutch physician in 2018. People seeking abortions can consult with a medical professional online or by phone and receive the pills in the mail for fees of up to $150, depending on income. \n\u201cWe have this huge discrepancy in abortion access in this country,\u201d said Elisa Wells, cofounder of Plan C, a nonprofit organization that supports access to abortion medication. \u201cIt\u2019s an injustice that disproportionately affects people of color, LGBTQ and others who are marginalized. \n \u201cBut even in states where legislators are trying their hardest to obstruct access to medication abortion,\u201d she said, \u201cthere are these online services available that offer alternate routes of access.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexasUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAs Abortion Pills Take Off, Some States Move to Curb Them\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline March 16, 2022\nAs Abortion Pills Take Off, Some States Move to Curb Them\nby Christine Vestal, Stateline March 16, 2022\n In June, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weaken or topple its nearly 50-year-old abortion rights decision, Roe v.
