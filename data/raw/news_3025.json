Sincerely, Jane\u2019s Revenge,\u201d the note,\u00a0which was posted online, says.\nThe note was addressed to Father Dan Andrews, pastor of the St. John Paul II Newman Center.\u00a0\nThe threat is the latest in a series of intimidation tactics used against pro-life organizations. In other instances,\u00a0the threats\u00a0have come in the form of spray-painted messages with a variation on the words, \u201cIf abortion isn\u2019t safe, neither are you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocated near the University of Nebraska at Omaha\u2019s Scott campus, the Newman Center is about a 14-minute drive south of Omaha in the town of Bellevue.\u00a0\nKristan Hawkins, president of the pro-life group Students for Life, shared the note on social media.\u00a0KETV.com\u00a0reported that the pro-life group was hosting a \u201cpolitical leadership workshop\u201d at the Newman center on Saturday morning.\u00a0\nBREAKING: Jane\u2019s Revenge threatens to shoot pro-lifers. This morning in Nebraska, our team arrived for our @SFLAction Poltical Leadership Workshop where we are gathering activists from across the state to strategize about how to use @studentsforlife\u2019s Campaign for \u2026\u2014 Kristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) December 3, 2022 \n\u201cThis morning, a threatening note was found on the St. John Paul II Newman Center Oratory door. The author of the note claims to represent Jane\u2019s Revenge,\u201d a Saturday statement from the Newman Center reads.\u00a0\nAndrews called the note \u201cunsettling and unfortunate\u201d but added that the \u201cChrist-centered residents and parishioners are undeterred,\u201d according to the statement.\n\u201cThis obviously causes us great concern. Our number one priority is the safety of our students,\u201d the priest said in the statement. \u201cWe are thankful for UNO Police\u2019s prompt response and attention to this threat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a string of tweets, Hawkins related what took place, and called on the Biden administration to act against \u201cpro-abortion terrorist groups.\u201d\n\u201cBREAKING: Jane\u2019s Revenge threatens to shoot pro-lifers. This morning in Nebraska, our team arrived for our @SFLAction Political Leadership Workshop where we are gathering activists from across the state to strategize about how to use @studentsforlife\u2019s Campaign for Abortion Free Cities to shut down the late-term abortion facility in the state. When we arrived, a death threat via guns from Jane\u2019s Revenge was posted on the door. We\u2019ve called the police and are scrambling to make it safe.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe are headed towards tragedy if [U.S. Attorney General] Merrick Garland continues to refuse to act to protect peaceful pro-lifers from pro-abortion terrorist groups. Sadly, the incendiary comments of leaders like Hillary Clinton yesterday comparing pro-lifers to the Taliban is case in point the poisoned political climate being deliberately fostered by corporate abortion and their allies,\u201d Hawkins added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration is laying the groundwork for deadly violence against pro-lifers while they support violence against those in the womb. They must act.\u201d\nThe University of Nebraska at Omaha\u2019s Department of Public Safety said in a Saturday statement that the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s office and the Omaha Police Department are working together to investigate the threat and increase security measures.\u00a0\nThe Newman Center and the campus are maintaining normal operations, the statement said.\u00a0\n\u201cIndividuals with information that can assist with the investigation are encouraged to contact UNO Public Safety by phone at 402.554.2648, by email at unopublicsafety@unomaha.edu, or by text using\u00a0U-TIP. The latest information will be published on the\u00a0UNO News Center\u00a0as it becomes available,\u201d the statement said.\u00a0\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of the most popular novenas\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nCNA reached out to the Archdiocese of Omaha for comment but did not immediately hear back by time of publication.\nEditor's note: A correction has been made to this article.
