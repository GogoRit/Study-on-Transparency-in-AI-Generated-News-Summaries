Previously, she was an editor and writer at the New York Times. She is also the author of three novels, including the New York Times bestseller Outlawed.\n      \n\n\n\n\nWhen Aya got a positive pregnancy test, she wanted to confirm the results at a clinic.\nBut the first six places she called either required her to pay out of pocket, or had no appointments for a week. So Aya went to a pregnancy resource center.\nSometimes called crisis pregnancy centers, the facilities\u2019 \u201cprimary mission is to dissuade women from choosing abortion,\u201d Katrina Kimport, an associate professor at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), a group at the University of California San Francisco, writes in a new study of patients at the centers, published on Friday in the journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health. The centers, most of which are religiously affiliated, typically offer services like pregnancy tests and sometimes resources like diapers or baby clothes, alongside counseling with an anti-abortion message.\nThe inner workings of pregnancy resource centers don\u2019t always get a lot of coverage in the media, and unless they\u2019ve visited one, many people may not know much about the facilities. But they have been a subject of major concern among abortion-rights advocates in recent years, because such centers have been found to give misinformation about the risks of abortion. Some advocates feared that the centers \u201cinappropriately interfered\u201d in patients\u2019 decisions around their pregnancies, \u201cpreventing people from being able to choose or obtain an abortion,\u201d Kimport told Vox.\nBut that\u2019s not what Kimport found in interviews with 21 patients, including Aya, who later went to a prenatal care clinic. Most of those patients had already decided to continue their pregnancies when they went to the resource centers. They visited the facilities for basic necessities \u2014 like ultrasounds and diapers \u2014 that were expensive or difficult to get elsewhere.\nIn many cases, the patients did get help at the centers. But some resources came with strings attached \u2014 free baby clothes and other supplies, for example, were only available if patients took workshops or classes, some of which had a religious component. Some women found the required instruction troubling, with one saying of a parenting video, \u201cit hurt me.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the patients Kimport talked to, most of whom were low-income, also had major needs that could not be met by pregnancy resource centers, from food insecurity to homelessness to high-risk pregnancies that required specialized care.\nIt\u2019s not necessarily surprising that the centers couldn\u2019t help women with these problems, Kimport told Vox \u2014 that\u2019s not really what they were designed to do.\nBut in recent years, states and the federal government have been increasingly positioning the centers as social safety-net providers, shifting money toward them and away from other facilities that provide a wider range of services, like family planning clinics. The Trump administration, for example, last year barred groups that provide or refer abortions from getting federal family planning funds, but awarded a grant to a network of pregnancy resource centers in California. \nKimport\u2019s research suggests that as family planning clinics and other service providers lose funding, pregnancy resource centers, at least as they\u2019re currently designed, won\u2019t be able to fill in the gaps. \nFor the patients Kimport talked to, going to such a center \u201cdidn\u2019t meet all of their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even meet most of their needs.\u201d\nThe women in the study mostly went to pregnancy resource centers for things like pregnancy tests or baby clothes\nPregnancy resource centers as they exist today first began appearing in the 1960s, after states began liberalizing their abortion laws, according to Heartbeat International, which identifies itself as the country\u2019s first network of such centers. Their spread increased after 1973, when the Supreme Court established Americans\u2019 right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. Today, there are around 2,500 such centers across the country.\nIn general, the centers\u2019 goal is to encourage people to carry their pregnancies to term rather than having abortions. For example, Heartbeat International aims \u201cto make abortion unwanted today and unthinkable for future generations,\u201d according to its website.\nHeartbeat\u2019s affiliates around the world \u2014 the organization says it has more than 2,800 facilities on six continents \u2014 offer a range of services. \u201cSome pregnancy resource centers provide pregnancy tests and material aid (diapers, clothing, etc.) while other pregnancy help medical clinics offer limited ultrasounds, STI testing, and prenatal care,\u201d said Andrea Trudden, the group\u2019s director of communications and marketing, in an email to Vox. Some also offer financial aid courses or mentorship for couples.\nPregnancy resource centers have been criticized in the past for ads and website copy that made them look like they offer abortions. In fact, they do not offer the procedure, and research has shown that their websites often include misinformation about its risks, like the false claim that abortion is linked to breast cancer or mental health problems. This has led to concerns that the centers will trick people into believing they offer abortion, then dissuade them from the procedure with false claims about its dangers.\nFor Heartbeat International, individual affiliates have a lot of autonomy when it comes to services they offer and information they provide, Trudden said. But in general, \u201cour clients have the right to choose an abortion, and they also have the right to know more fully what may be at stake in their decision.\u201d\nBecause of concerns about misinformation, however, Kimport wanted to learn more about why patients go to pregnancy resource centers, and what happens when they get there. Other researchers have studied the centers in recent years, often looking at the information presented on their websites. \nBut, Kimport writes, \u201cthe voices of pregnant people who have visited the centers\u201d are largely missing from the existing scholarship. So she and her team asked patients who came to prenatal care clinics in southern Louisiana and Baltimore, Maryland if they\u2019d ever been to such a center, and if they were willing to talk about their experiences.\nThe first surprise for Kimport was that relatively few patients had actually been to the centers. Over a two-year period from 2015 to 2017, she found just 21 people who had been to one and were comfortable talking about the experience (a few said they had visited a center but preferred not to talk about, but about 80 percent agreed to be interviewed). Nineteen of the 21 patients were black, one was Latina, and one was white; most worked low-wage jobs or were unemployed.\nThe second surprise was that despite the centers\u2019 mission to dissuade people from having abortions, most people were not even considering that option when they went to the centers. Just four of the 21 women were thinking about terminating the pregnancy when they went to the center, and all four were also thinking about continuing it.\nMost of them went to the centers not for help deciding what to do, but to get resources or services they needed for their pregnancies or eventual children. \nOne woman, identified in the study as Samantha (all names are pseudonyms), needed proof of pregnancy to qualify for Medicaid insurance. Aya wanted proof of her pregnancy from an \u201cofficial\u201d entity because she believed it would help with her husband\u2019s green card application. In contrast to the other facilities she called, the pregnancy resource center could see her for a same-day appointment at no charge, so she went there.\nAll the women in the study were \u201cdeeply concerned about their ability to materially provide for a new baby,\u201d Kimport writes, and some went to the centers at least in part to get baby products like clothes. \u201cThey had clothes, they had baby chairs and bouncers,\u201d one woman told the researchers. \u201cThey offered a lot.\u201d\nThe services and baby products weren\u2019t necessarily \u201cfree\u201d\nThese items didn\u2019t cost money, but they typically came with strings attached: namely, that pregnant people would keep coming to the center and participating in programs. \u201cI went to a parenting class,\u201d one said. \u201cWhen you go, you watch, like, two movies, and you earn five [center] \u2018dollars,\u2019 and they give you a list of things that they have that you can shop for.\u201d \nA points system is common at pregnancy resource centers, Trudden of Heartbeat International said. \u201cIt encourages continued learning while providing practical items for the family,\u201d she added. \u201cMany parents find this to be a great benefit and love the fact that they can provide for their family while learning life skills.\u201d \nBut in Kimport\u2019s study, some of the women described the classes as unpleasant or upsetting. While respondents did report that the counseling they received was \u201creligiously inflected,\u201d Kimport said, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the problem \u2014 in some cases the women were religious themselves. In one case, however, a woman was shown a video with an explicitly anti-abortion message and was angry that the center presumed she was seeking an abortion. Another woman felt hurt by a video because it reminded her of past trauma in her life.\nIn some cases, the need to show up to appointments in order to get resources caused problems for women. One respondent, Katelyn, told researchers that the pregnancy resource center scheduled her appointment for a time when she was supposed to be working. \u201cDesperate for the resources they offered and believing that attending all of the center\u2019s appointments was important for the health of her pregnancy, Katelyn missed work to go to the appointment,\u201d Kimport writes. Katelyn was fired, and she and her boyfriend ended up losing their apartment because they couldn\u2019t pay rent.\nThe findings underscore what other researchers have found about pregnancy resource centers and their offerings. \u201cWhile their services may not cost money, they\u2019re not necessarily free,\u201d said Andrea Swartzendruber, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia who studies the centers. \u201cThey cost people\u2019s time and energy.\u201d\nOnce they had attended classes, the women were not always able to choose what items they received. One woman, Danielle, said she was considering saving up her points to get something larger, but her counselor at the center \u201cwas like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just so excited. I want you to get something.\u2019 So, she picked out a bottle, a blanket, a little set of lotions and some onesies.\u201d Danielle was grateful for the items, but, Kimport writes, \u201cthey were not her own choice.\u201d\nIn general, the products the women reported getting were relatively minor, like prenatal vitamins, a water bottle, or baby clothes. \nAll of the women in the study \u2014 including Katelyn \u2014 said their visit to a center was a positive experience. Many were grateful for the baby items they got, even if they weren\u2019t necessarily what they would have chosen. \nOne thing the centers did provide for respondents, Kimport writes, was a place where \u201ctheir desire to have a child was supported and encouraged.\u201d That\u2019s significant because, as she notes, low-income women, especially women of color, are sometimes actively discouraged from having children, including by their health care providers. \nHowever, the centers are not truly \u201csafe spaces for emotional support\u201d for many people of color, Nourbese Flint, policy director at the reproductive justice organization Black Women for Wellness, told Vox. \nBlack people who have visited pregnancy resource centers have told her they faced racist assumptions about things like their income or whether their fathers are in their lives, Flint said. They also, she said, sometimes heard the increasingly common anti-abortion message that abortion is a conspiracy against black people. That message implies that \u201cblack women are not able to make decisions about whether or not they want to keep a pregnancy by themselves,\u201d she added \u2014 \u201cthat it\u2019s just outside forces and we\u2019re not smart enough to understand what\u2019s best for our lives.\u201d\nAnd overall, Kimport said, while pregnancy resource centers did supply some of what the study participants needed, \u201cthere were still, for many of the respondents, very acute social and material needs that were not met through going to these centers.\u201d\nPregnancy resource centers are being touted as a replacement for the social safety net. The study suggests they aren\u2019t one. \nPregnancy resource centers weren\u2019t necessarily set up to meet all those needs \u2014 as Kimport noted, they are privately run and often staffed largely by volunteers. \nBut increasingly, they\u2019re being asked to take the place of social services agencies.\nIn 1996, Missouri and Pennsylvania began to allocate state funding to pregnancy resource centers. Other states began to make similar moves, including Louisiana, which began devoting some of its budget for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \u2014 meant to help low-income people with their basic needs \u2014 to programs offering \u201cabortion alternatives,\u201d including pregnancy resource centers. Today, 16 states directly fund the centers, Swartzendruber told Vox. \nMeanwhile, the Trump administration last year awarded a grant to Obria, a network of pregnancy resource centers in California, under Title X, a program designed to provide family planning support to low-income Americans. The same year, the administration issued a rule barring providers that receive Title X funds from providing or referring for abortions. That forced Planned Parenthood and many other providers that offer a full range of reproductive health services \u2014 including, in some cases, prenatal care \u2014 to stop taking Title X money, and some have closed as a result.\nNationwide, research has shown that \u201cdecreases in the social safety net have been accompanied by a growth of privately run pregnancy resource centers,\u201d Kimport said.\nBut her research suggests that those centers aren\u2019t offering the same services as the social safety net providers they\u2019re supposed to replace \u2014 and that the help they do offer comes at a cost to pregnant people, even if that cost isn\u2019t financial.\nKimport acknowledged some limitations in her study. Since the people she interviewed had visited a prenatal care clinic after going to a pregnancy resource center, the study might not have captured the full range of experiences of people who went to the centers \u2014 for example, she might have gotten a different picture if she interviewed people who went to the center but then ended up getting abortions. And while most of the people in Kimport\u2019s study were already decided about their pregnancies when they went to centers, Swartzendruber said her research suggests people go to such facilities for a variety of reasons, including help with decision-making.\nStill, the study can help flesh out Americans\u2019 understanding of pregnancy resource centers \u2014 especially since research and media coverage delving into people\u2019s experiences there has been relatively rare \u2014 as well as pointing out holes in the social safety net that cause some people to go to the centers in the first place. For example, Kimport said, \u201cif you need proof of pregnancy in order to get on Medicaid, but it costs money to get an official proof of pregnancy, that does seem to be a contradiction.\u201d\nAnd for Flint, the centers are \u201cunfortunately capitalizing on a gap that we have in our system in terms of responding to the actual real needs of pregnant folks and the actual real needs of families.\u201d \nOverall, the study is a reminder that for too many pregnant people in America, getting basic care and resources is difficult or impossible \u2014 and at least as of now, pregnancy resource centers don\u2019t change that reality.\n\n\n\nWill you help keep Vox free for all?\n\n      At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn\u2019t only be available to those who can afford to pay.
