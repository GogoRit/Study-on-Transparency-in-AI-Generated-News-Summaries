Those are the types of images that would stop me visiting my own town square.\u201d\n\n\n\n  Another witness, Lesley Finlayson, said: \u201cI totally agree with that campaign but it\u2019s not about that, that image was wrong.\n\n\n  \u201cIt was used to cause anger and cause upset in my community. It seems over the top, the size of them, they were the size of a person, it was vile.\u201d\n\n\n  Regarding these and more testimonies from residents, Judge Radway said: \u201cThese are not hollow, empty descriptions given by over-sensitive people; they are the very real consequences for these local witnesses.\"\n\n\n  He added that he did not agree that the CPN was an attempt on the council\u2019s part to shut down the campaign, pointing out that \u201cat most it was blunted a little\u201d, since they could still campaign in many other ways.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anti-abortion group were protesting against MP Stella Creasy\n\n\n  Mr Hacking is an employee the Centre for Bioethical Reform UK (CBR UK), which organised a number of demonstrations against local MP Stella Creasy after her amendment extending abortion rights to Northern Ireland.\n\n\n  On October 3, the court heard Mr Hacking was given a warning to remove the banners within 15 minutes after the crowd became agitated.\n\n\n  Anti-social behaviour service delivery manager Philip Connor, who issued the CPN, told the court he was worried the situation \u201cwould have continued to escalate\u201d otherwise.\n\n\n  He said: \u201cI made the decision I felt was best for the safety of everyone there. That was as feisty a space as I have seen professionally, people were evidently upset.\n\n\n\n  \u201cI have a duty to protect people\u2019s physical and mental health. It was not a case of who shouts loudest. We have a statutory duty to tackle behaviour likely to cause alarm or distress.\n\n\n  \u201cThere were numerous further demonstrations after the event and on many of those occasions we took no action because we respect their freedom of speech.\u201d\n\n\n  Campaigners will appeal their appeal\n\n\n  Responding to the outcome, Mr Hacking said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d his case was not successful and he intends to further appeal this decision.\n\n\n  He added that, in his view, it was the foetus and not MP Creasy or those negatively impacted by the display which is \u201cthe real victim of abortion\u201d.\n\n\n  He said: \"How can we see positive change in the UK if politicians and councils are allowed to dictate how we express peaceable opinions in public?\n\n\n  \"For the sake of the unborn and for freedom of speech we must take this appeal further and hold those authorities to account.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more breaking news, local headlines and features,\u00a0\u2018like\u2019 our Facebook page.\n\n\nWe also have a Twitter account: @ELondonGuardian\n\n\nFollow us to keep up-to-date with news in Waltham Forest and Redbridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Comments: Our rules\n            \n\n\n                    We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
