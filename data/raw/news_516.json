The law would effectively prohibit abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they\u2019re pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn Friday, a federal judge temporarily blocked South Carolina\u2019s ban from staying in effect. Courts have prevented similar near-total abortion bans from going into effect in several other states, including North Dakota, Iowa, Kentucky and Ohio.\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAbortion bans disproportionately hurt those that already have the least access to quality health care, including people with low incomes, people of color, people who are LGBTQ, and those who live in rural areas,\u201d Jenny Black, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement. \u201cIf this law is allowed to go into effect, it will pose a serious threat to South Carolinians\u2019 health and livelihood.\u201d\nSouth Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican, released a statement on Thursday acknowledging the lawsuit.\n\u201cMy office will vigorously defend this law in court because there is nothing more important than protecting life,\u201d he said.\nThe law would make abortion illegal, with narrow exceptions including cases of rape or incest or if the life of the pregnant person is at risk. Doctors who perform an abortion on a victim of rape or incest will be required to report the allegations to law enforcement, including contact information for the pregnant person.\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Pregnant people who violate the law do not face charges.\nHours after the legislature voted to pass the bill, Gov. Henry McMaster signed it surrounded by abortion opponents who have framed the legislation as a \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill. The governor said he had a \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cprotect life above all else.\u201d He also called the law a step that \u201cwas long in coming and monumental in consequence.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a great day. It\u2019s a happy day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of happy hearts beating right now all across South Carolina.\u201d\nRepublican lawmakers who support near-total abortion bans have indicated that they\u2019re advancing these bills to bring such legislation in front of a conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court. Attorneys for abortion-rights advocates have successfully argued in court that these laws violate Roe v. Wade \u2014 the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\u00a0\n\u201cThey see new justices, and they think they have a chance of overturning nearly 50 years of precedent, so they\u2019re spending taxpayer dollars to defend what are actually blatantly unconstitutional laws,\u201d said Alexandra Thompson is a staff attorney for Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the co-lead counsels in the lawsuit.\nThe South Carolina measure advanced quickly through the legislative process over several weeks. Republicans control both chambers of the South Carolina statehouse and expanded that control in the 2020 election. The additional power gave them more leeway in advancing the bill this session.\u00a0\nThe Senate passed the bill late last month before the final vote Thursday in the House. The Democratic minority caucus, during a procedural vote on the bill the previous day, walked out of the House chamber in protest.\nAbortion-rights advocates say the legislation is the first major abortion restriction passed out of a statehouse in 2021. In mid-January, they estimated that they\u2019ve tracked more than 100 bills filed in statehouses this year around the country that would curtail abortion access. One month later, they said that tally is now up to more than 200 bills aimed at restricting or banning abortion.\nIn South Carolina, most abortions are already restricted after about 20 weeks of pregnancy. Telemedicine abortion is also prohibited.\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood are representing Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and Greenville Women\u2019s Clinic in the lawsuit. Several state officials, including members of the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners, are listed as defendants.\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina House passes six-week abortion ban\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina passes 12-week abortion ban\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is banned after six weeks of pregnancy in South Carolina\n\n\n\n\nState lawmakers prepare for a future without Roe v.
