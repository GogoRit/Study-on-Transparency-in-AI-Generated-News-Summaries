The official also administered the sacrament to the president's consort, who is by protocol Argentina's first lady.\nArgentine Bishop Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences, administered Holy Communion during a Mass offered Jan. 31 in the grotto of St. Peter's Basilica, shortly before a meeting between Fern\u00e1ndez' and Pope Francis.\nArgentine newspaper La Naci\u00f3n posted a video of the Mass, in which Argentina's President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Fabiola Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the president's domestic partner, can be seen approaching the bishop to receive the Eucharist.\nFern\u00e1ndez has pledged to promote a bill in the country's legislature that would legalize abortion. In 2018, Argentina's Senate defeated a bill that would have legalized abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Argentine bishops have responded to the president's abortion advocacy with a planned pro-life Mass and other pro-life activities.\nFern\u00e1ndez was divorced in 2005. Yanez has been his consort since 2014; in 2019 she moved into Argentina's presidential residence.\nSorondo was asked by online newsite LifeSiteNews last week about the distribution of Holy Communion to Fernandez.\nThe bishop said that according to canon law \"you are obliged to give communion if somebody asks you for communion. Only in the case that he is excommunicated. The President is not excommunicated, so I can give communion if he asks me for communion.\"\nCanon 915 of the Church's Code of Canon Law says that Catholics who are \"obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion.\"\nIn 1994, the Congregation from the Doctrine of the Faith clarified that \"Members of the faithful who live together as husband and wife with persons other than their legitimate spouses may not receive Holy Communion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regard to advocacy for the legal protection of abortion, in 2004 Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then Prefect for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a memorandum to US bishops which stated that a Catholic politician who consistently campaigns and votes for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws \"should not present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin\" and that his pastor should warn him \"that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist.\"\nAlso present at the Mass were members of Fern\u00e1ndez' government, accompanying him on a European trip: Foreign Minister Felipe Sol\u00e1; Secretary for Strategic Affairs, Gustavo Beliz; Justice Minister, Marcela Losardo; and the Secretary for Religious Affairs, Guillermo Oliveri.\n\n\nTags:\nEucharist, \nBishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, \nAlberto Fernandez\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\nOur mission is the truth.
