Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization\u00a0has renewed attention to medication abortion as a way to expand access to abortion in states protective of abortion access and to preserve access to abortion in states that seek to enact restrictive laws. In recent years, telehealth has been explored\u00a0and tested\u00a0as a way to\u00a0expand access to medication abortion,\u00a0with growing importance\u00a0for communities with\u00a0few abortion providers. This approach has gained additional attention\u00a0given\u00a0the\u00a0need to limit in-person contact during the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic.\nHowever,\u00a0expanding access to medication abortion via telehealth has been\u00a0limited by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u00a0restriction\u00a0that\u00a0had permitted only\u00a0certified clinicians\u00a0to dispense\u00a0mifepristone\u00a0at a health care\u00a0setting.\u00a0Enforcement of this requirement has been temporarily\u00a0paused during the pandemic emergency. On\u00a0December 16,\u00a02021, the\u00a0FDA\u00a0permanently revised\u00a0the\u00a0policy following a review prompted by a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0challenging these rules. This change, which no longer requires clinicians to dispense the drug in person, opens\u00a0the door\u00a0in many states\u00a0for more people to have access to\u00a0medication abortion via telehealth.\u00a0However,\u00a0the impact of this policy change will not be the same across the country, as many states have established abortion-specific policies that either require abortion patients to come in person to get the service, set their own policies\u00a0regarding\u00a0the\u00a0dispensing\u00a0of the medications used for abortion care,\u00a0or\u00a0directly\u00a0ban\u00a0the use of\u00a0telehealth\u00a0for\u00a0abortion care.\nThis\u00a0brief\u00a0outlines\u00a0the intersection of\u00a0federal policy\u00a0regarding dispensing medication abortion\u00a0with\u00a0state laws\u00a0regulating the\u00a0provision of abortion services and mifepristone dispensing via\u00a0telehealth and considers\u00a0the implications of\u00a0the recent\u00a0FDA change\u00a0in different states.\nCurrent Federal Policies Regarding Medication Abortion\nMifepristone, often referred to as\u00a0medication abortion,\u00a0RU-486, or the abortion pill,\u00a0was approved by the FDA as a medication to end pregnancy 20 years ago.\u00a0A regimen of\u00a0mifepristone,\u00a0followed by misoprostol, is\u00a0an FDA approved protocol\u00a0for abortion during the first 70 days\u00a0or\u00a0up to\u00a010 weeks\u00a0after the first day of a missed period. Medication abortions account for over a third\u00a0(39%)\u00a0of\u00a0all abortions in the US.\u00a0Medication abortion is a safe and highly effective method of pregnancy termination.\u00a0The pregnancy is terminated successfully\u00a099.6%\u00a0of the time, with a\u00a00.4%\u00a0risk of major complications, and an associated\u00a0mortality rate\u00a0of less than 0.001 percent (0.00064%).\nIn 2011, the FDA added a\u00a0Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)\u00a0to the dispensation requirements for\u00a0mifepristone\u00a0(see box below),\u00a0which\u00a0permitted\u00a0only\u00a0medical providers who had\u00a0received special certification from the manufacturer to prescribe and directly dispense the drug. This requirement not only limited the number of clinicians able to prescribe medication abortions, necessitated a visit to a health care setting and also meant patients\u00a0could not\u00a0obtain the medication from a retail pharmacy or by mail.\n\n\n\nBox 1: Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)\n\n\nREMS 2011-2021\nREMS as modified December 16, 2021\n\n\nThe prescribing clinician had to be certified by one of the two mifepristone distributors (Danco Laboratories and\u00a0GenBioPro).\nBroadens to Certified Pharmacies: The prescribing clinician or pharmacy must be certified by one of the two mifepristone distributors (Danco Laboratories and GenBioPro).\n\n\nThe prescriber had to obtain a patient agreement form from the patient before dispensing mifepristone.\nNo change:\u00a0The prescriber\u00a0must\u00a0obtain a patient agreement form from the patient before dispensing mifepristone.\n\n\nThe prescriber could only dispense to patients in health care settings.\nRemoved health care setting dispensing requirement: mifepristone may be dispensed by certified pharmacies and through the mail.\n\n\n\nOn December 16, 2021, after an extensive scientific review of the safety of medication abortion in part prompted by litigation, the FDA removed the in-person dispensing requirement for Mifepristone and now allows certified pharmacies, in addition to certified providers, to dispense the drug. Both of these changes broadened the modes in which the medication can be dispensed. However, the FDA still requires doctors and pharmacies to be certified by the manufacturers. In April 2022, the manufacturers will submit proposed protocols to the FDA.\u00a0 After the FDA accepts the submissions, it has 180 days to review or modify the proposed protocols. Pharmacies may be able to sign up for certification to dispense mifepristone by late 2022. In the meantime, the Federal Public Health Emergency allows the FDA to pause enforcement of the health care setting dispensing requirement.\nState Policies Requiring In-Person Visits for Abortions Effectively Ban Telehealth for Medication Abortion\nAccess to medication abortion\u00a0hinges not only on the\u00a0Federal\u00a0FDA\u2019s decision but also on the\u00a0abortion-specific regulations that are on the books in many states (Appendix 1). While\u00a0some states have\u00a0directly\u00a0banned\u00a0telemedicine abortions,\u00a0other state\u00a0regulations\u2014including ultrasound and counseling requirements, waiting periods, and specific in-person dispensing\u00a0mandates\u2014also play a role\u00a0in\u00a0limiting\u00a0the feasibility of using telehealth\u00a0for medication abortion.\u00a0The map below illustrates how state laws\u00a0force people to\u00a0make,\u00a0in some cases, multiple in-person visits to\u00a0a\u00a0clinic to complete a medication abortion. In states\u00a0without\u00a0restrictions, people do not need\u00a0to make\u00a0any visits to a clinic\u00a0to safely\u00a0have a medication abortion under the supervision of a health care provider.\n\n\n\n\n.\nAs the option of telehealth abortions has been broadened federally,\u00a0some states have\u00a0moved to\u00a0enact new policies that further restrict\u00a0access to medication abortion. For example,\u00a0an executive order by South Dakota\u2019s Governor directed the state\u2019s health department to ban telehealth for medication abortion. The Department established a new rule\u00a0requiring pregnant patients\u00a0to\u00a0obtain each of the drugs\u00a0used in\u00a0medication abortion\u2014mifepristone and misoprostol\u2014 in person at a licensed abortion facility, and to come back for a follow up\u00a0visit. The\u00a0FDA has never required\u00a0misoprostol to be\u00a0dispensed by a doctor or\u00a0taken at a medical facility and there is no FDA requirement for an in person follow up visit. South Dakota also requires an in-person counseling and consent visit and a 72-hour waiting period before any abortion care can be provided. With the new rule, patients would be required to have 4 in-person visits (Figure 2). Planned Parenthood, the only abortion provider in South Dakota, has challenged South Dakota rule, stating, \u201cThe Rule will impose severe obstacles to abortion access for South Dakotans and may subject patients to unnecessary health risks, with absolutely no benefit to health and safety, in violation of their constitutional rights.\u201d On January 26, 2022, the day before the rule would have become effective, the federal district judge blocked the state from enforcing the rules while the litigation continues.\nFigure 2: Court Blocks South Dakota Rule Requiring Four In Person Visits for Medication Abortion while the Litigation Proceeds\nIn the run up to the FDA\u2019s change in policy\u00a0in 2021,\u00a0six states (AZ,\u00a0IN, OH, MT\u00a0OK,\u00a0and\u00a0TX)\u00a0passed laws banning mailing abortion medication.\u00a0Although the Montana and Ohio laws are currently blocked by court order, other states could move to enact similar policies.\u00a0In contrast, patients in states that have no restrictions can obtain a medication abortion with a telehealth visit and no required in-person visits.\nPotential Litigation\nIt is unusual, but not unheard of,\u00a0for states to enact policies that overrule\u00a0an FDA-established protocol for dispensing a drug.\u00a0In 2014 Massachusetts attempted to restrict an opioid more stringently\u00a0than\u00a0the FDA recommended, and after the manufacturer sued, a\u00a0court\u00a0invalidated the law, finding the state law was preempted by federal law. The court\u00a0ruled\u00a0that\u00a0allowing the law to stand would \u201cundermine the FDA\u2019s ability to make drugs available to promote and protect the public health.\u201d\u00a0It is unknown whether the same preemption argument might be used to challenge state laws that restrict use of mifepristone to earlier in pregnancy than 10 weeks, the time period allowed by the FDA-approved protocol.\u00a0For example, in\u00a02021\u00a0a new\u00a0Texas\u00a0law (SB 4)\u00a0restricts\u00a0the use of\u00a0mifepristone\u00a0to 7 weeks.\u00a0The\u00a0recent Texas law\u00a0on medication abortion\u00a0has not yet been challenged.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0it is not clear how states\u2019\u00a0authority to regulate or ban mifepristone will\u00a0be affected\u00a0if the Supreme Court overturns\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and eliminates the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability.\nUnanswered Questions & Looking Forward\nFederal and state policy both impact the availability of medication abortion. While the FDA has modified the rules in which mifepristone can be dispensed, the availability of telehealth for abortion medication will continue to vary by state. In some states, the option of a telehealth medication abortion will expand access to abortion for the people who reside there. In other states where there are laws or policies that fully ban telemedicine abortion or greatly restrict the circumstances in which this service can be provided and obtained, there is less clarity. Can out-of-state providers who provide telehealth abortion services to people residing in states that ban or restrict it be prosecuted? Or are there actions that policy makers in states that allow telehealth abortion can take to protect the clinicians who reside in their states? Distribution issues, such as whether providers can mail the medication across state lines and whether patients would need to travel to access the medication, are still not clearly resolved.\nLater\u00a0this year,\u00a0the Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0will issue its\u00a0decision in\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization,\u00a0that\u00a0could dramatically alter\u00a0the landscape of abortion law\u00a0in states\u00a0across the country.\u00a0It is clear that the FDA\u2019s decision to remove the in-person requirements for dispensing mifepristone will greatly expand\u00a0access to abortion care\u00a0through telehealth, particularly for\u00a0people living far from clinics in states that will continue to allow abortions regardless of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Dobbs.\u00a0What is less clear, however, will be the impact of existing\u00a0and forthcoming state policies\u00a0limiting\u00a0abortions\u00a0on the availability of medication abortion for the people who reside in those states.\u00a0Regardless of the outcome of the\u00a0Mississippi law being challenged at the Supreme Court,\u00a0access to medication abortion\u2014either over state lines\u00a0by mail\u00a0or when traveling\u00a0from a state that bans abortion to one that\u00a0permits\u00a0it\u2014could play an\u00a0increasingly\u00a0important role\u00a0for those seeking abortion care.\n\u00a0Appendix 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nWomen's Health Policy\n\n\n\nTags\n\nAbortion\nTelehealth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnews release\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFeb 2022\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMedication Abortion Via Telehealth: What You Need to Know About State Regulations\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso of Interest\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion at SCOTUS: Dobbs v.
