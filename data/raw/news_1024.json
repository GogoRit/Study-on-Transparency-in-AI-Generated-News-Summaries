Wade, June 24, 2022, in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nHenrietta Wildsmith/The Shreveport Times/AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington\nCNN\n        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n    \n\n\n            Abortions are legal once again in Louisiana after a state court on Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order against the state\u2019s ban that took effect following the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n    \n\n            The court order allows abortion services in the state to resume at least until July 18, when a hearing is set to consider whether a preliminary injunction should be issued.\n    \n\n            It\u2019s just the latest legal twist for Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban, which was temporarily blocked last month by a state district judge. The state\u2019s attorney general asked the state Supreme Court to step in, and it kicked it back to the lower courts. There, a different judge, Ethel S. Julien, ruled Friday that the New Orleans court did not have the authority to pause the law as the case was transferred to a Baton Rouge state court. The move cleared the way for the state\u2019s trigger law to immediately take effect and blocked abortion clinics in the state from operating.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gather to protest against the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health case on June 24, 2022, in Austin, Texas.\n\nMaggie Boyd/Sipa/AP\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhere state abortion bans stand amid legal challenges\n\n\n\n\n            The abortion ban remained in place until Baton Rouge District Judge Donald Johnson\u2019s ruling on Tuesday.\n    \n\n            The Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the litigators in the case, has asked the court in Baton Rouge to more permanently block the bans.\n    \n\n            \u201cThis is an incredible relief for people who need abortion care right now in Louisiana. Abortion care in the state can resume today, and further irreparable harm has been avoided,\u201d Jenny Ma, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cOur work continues and we now look ahead to our hearing on Monday, where we will ask the judge to block the bans more permanently.\u201d\n    \n\n            Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, meanwhile, tweeted from his verified account Tuesday that \u201cthe people of Louisiana have spoken both directly at the ballot box and through their elected legislature again and again and again - not only statutorily but also constitutionally.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cTo have the judiciary create a legal circus is disappointing and what discredits the institutions we rely upon for a stable society,\u201d Landry said. \u201cThe rule of law must be followed, and I will not rest until it is. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer for that to happen.\u201d\n    \n\n            The Supreme Court\u2019s majority decision to strike down the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which established a federal right to abortion, has led states like Louisiana to implement their own abortion laws. The high court ruling has, as anticipated, already resulted in a patchwork system across the country in which access to the procedure is, for many people, determined largely by whether a state is controlled by Republicans or Democrats.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
