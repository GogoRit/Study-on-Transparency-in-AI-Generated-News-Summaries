The proposal provides exceptions for victims of rape and incest, and it would also allow abortion to save the life of the mother.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are pushing to protect abortion rights nationally. In July, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to prohibit abortion bans in line with Roe v Wade, enshrining the right to the procedure until fetal viability \u2013 around 24 weeks.\nBut like Graham\u2019s bill, the Democratic-led proposal has little chance of being approved in the Senate, where a legislative procedure known as the filibuster requires 60 votes for the 100-member chamber to pass major legislation.\nDemocratic leaders, including President Joe Biden, have vowed to carve out an exception for the filibuster to pass the abortion legislation next year if they gain two seats in the Senate in the upcoming midterms.\nWhile Democrats have the thinnest of majorities in the chamber, two more conservative Democratic senators currently oppose abolishing the filibuster.\u00a0\u201cImagine if we just elected two more Democrats to the Senate and keep the House of Representatives. We\u2019ll codify Roe v Wade,\u201d Biden said in a speech last week.\n\nBREAKING: Lindsey Graham has introduced a NATIONAL abortion ban. Despite knowing bans are unpopular and put people\u2019s lives in danger \u2014 this is anti-abortion politicians' end goal.\nLet's show them the hell we're about to raise in the comments.\n\u2014 Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) September 13, 2022\n\nUpcoming midterms\nAbortion has taken centre stage in the lead-up to the November election, with Democratic candidates accusing their Republican opponents of pushing to violate women\u2019s right to autonomy over their own bodies.\nIn conservative Kansas, where Trump beat Biden by 15 percentage points in the 2020 presidential elections, residents overwhelmingly voted to preserve abortion rights in a referendum in early August.\nIn New York, a Democratic candidate who centred abortion rights in his campaign won a contested special House election. And late last month, a Democratic House candidate won a state-wide election in Alaska, defeating former vice presidential candidate and Trump ally Sarah Palin.\nThe White House denounced Graham\u2019s bill on Tuesday, calling it \u201cwildly out of step\u201d with the views of the US public.\n\u201cPresident Biden and Congressional Democrats are committed to restoring the protections of Roe v Wade in the face of continued radical steps by elected Republicans to put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians instead of women and their doctors, threatening women\u2019s health and lives,\u201d White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\nBut Graham said his bill aims to counter the Democrats\u2019 own proposal, and he called for a debate on the legislation. He stressed that Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the court case that led to the overturning of Roe v Wade, does not ban abortion; rather, it leaves it to elected officials to regulate the procedure.\n\u201cAbortion is a contentious issue,\u201d the Republican senator said. \u201cPost-Dobbs, America\u2019s got to make some decisions.\u201d\n\nDemocrats slam bill\nSeveral Democrats criticised Graham\u2019s proposed legislation and rejected its title, which proclaims to target \u201clate-term\u201d abortions.\n\u201cRepublicans are now coming after the right to abortion at the federal level,\u201d Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cOverturning Roe was never about giving power back to states \u2014 it was about controlling our bodies and our personal autonomy. We cannot let this happen.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Graham\u2019s proposal \u201cradical\u201d, accusing Republicans of seeking to punish women who seek abortions.\n\u201cFor MAGA Republicans \u2013 it\u2019s always been about making abortion illegal everywhere,\u201d Schumer tweeted, referring to Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d.\nNARAL Pro-Choice America, an advocacy organisation that backs abortion rights, also said the bill shows that Republicans\u2019 true aim is to ban abortion.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about what a bill like this would do \u2013 it could put a ban on abortion in place in every state in our country, including blue states that have laws protecting abortion rights and access on the books,\u201d Mini Timmaraju, the group\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\u201cThis is about who gets to decide what\u2019s right for our lives and our families. Should it be a person who is pregnant? Or Lindsey Graham and MAGA Republicans?\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Graham is pushing a radical bill for a nationwide abortion ban\nFor MAGA Republicans\u2014it's always been about making abortion illegal everywhere\nDems are fighting to protect abortion rights\nMAGA Republicans want to punish women & doctors for carrying them out\n\u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 13, 2022\n\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
