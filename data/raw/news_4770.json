Only minor restrictions were permissible, such as licensing of abortion facilities and banning late terminations.The two dissenting justices were Byron White and William Rehnquist, who stated, \u201cTo reach this result the court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the amendment.\u201dAdvertisementThe seven other justices agreed that \u201cthe right to abortion is \u2018within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019\u201dAdvertisementThe court divided a pregnancy into three-month trimesters and ruled that the state has \u201cno right to restrict abortion\u201d during the first trimester. During the second trimester, \u201cminimal curbs are permitted.\u201d And during the third trimester, when a fetus is able to live outside of the womb, the justices ruled states could forbid abortion except in cases where it is necessary to save the mother\u2019s life.Related:Norma McCorvey\u2019s oldest daughter talked family, issues before abortion case overturnedThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on a 1965 ruling that struck down the anti-contraception law in Connecticut.
