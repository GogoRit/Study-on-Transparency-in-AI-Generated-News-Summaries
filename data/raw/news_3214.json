To me, the right choice is to have the courage to let the unborn be born.\"STAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!The abortion debate has been reignited across the country after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, sending the decision back to individual states.\u00a0Abortions are currently legal in Michigan because\u00a0a state judge in May issued an injunction against a 1931 law\u00a0allowing the procedure only when \"necessary to preserve the life of such woman.\"Sharing the stage\u00a0with the Rev. John Riccardo, founder of Acts XXIX, a Catholic organization designed to support other clergy, Harbaugh spoke of courage necessary to stand up for one's beliefs.\"I believe in having the courage to let the unborn be born,\" Harbaugh said, according to the Detroit Catholic. \"I love life. I believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drives these beliefs in me.\"\u00a0More:Gov.

During the beginning of the Colin Kaepernick controversy, Harbaugh first said in 2016 he didn't \"respect the motivation or the action.\" He later called Kaepernick a hero and hosted his former Super Bowl quarterback to a throwing exhibition during Michigan's spring game in April.\u00a0In 2017, Harbaugh spoke in Washington about his involvement with the Legal Services Corporation, addressing the access to justice for low-income Americans.\u00a0In 2020, Harbaugh spoke out against the death of George Floyd, the Black man killed by a police officer kneeling on his neck in Minneapolis. He also\u00a0attended an anti-police brutality march in Ann Arbor a few days later.Sarah Harbaugh, who spoke after her husband and Riccardo, said there is some thought that their pro-life stance may impact the Wolverines on the recruiting trail, but the couple are not worried about it.\u00a0\"During halftime of a game, talking with the players, I say they are here because they have chosen to be here,\" Jim Harbaugh said according to the publication. \"If someone believes in what they stand for, they are choosing to stand for that position, and what kind of person are you if you don\u2019t fight tooth and nail for what you stand for? You get to change hearts by fighting for what you stand for.\"Harbaugh, the father of seven including Jay, one of his assistant coaches at Michigan, said his views on abortion were shaped by his own parents\"Passions can make the process messy, but when combined with respect, it ultimately produces the best outcomes,\" Harbaugh said according to the Detroit Catholic. \"This process has been passionate and messy, but I have faith in the American people to ultimately develop the right policies and laws for all lives involved. I recognize one\u2019s personal thinking regarding morality of a particular action may differ from their thinking on whether government should make that action illegal. There are many things one may hold to be immoral, but the government appropriately allows because of some greater good or personal or constitutional right.\"Harbaugh then said while the rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn child may conflict, the choice should be in favor of the child.Between the dinner, auction of Michigan football items and other prizes, and other donations, some $144,000 were raised at the sold-out event. One person reportedly pledged $2,300 to catch a pass in the ballroom from Harbaugh.\u00a0Follow Kirkland Crawford\u00a0on Twitter @HiKirkHere.Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."
