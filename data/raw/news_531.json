Among the suggestions was for women to get a \u201cpersonal room\u201d and the \u201cchance to have a cry\u201d.\nThe proposal is among a number of ideas being put forward by political parties in response to last week\u2019s publication of a ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal, thereby bringing it into force. The ruling outlaws abortion due to birth defects of the foetus, which previously made up around 98% of legal terminations in Poland.\nThe judgement has prompted discussion of new legislation in parliament. The national-conservative ruling coalition is seeking ways to support women who must now give birth to foetuses diagnosed with defects, while a left-wing opposition group is proposing a law to decriminalise doctors who provide abortions.\n\nProtests return to Polish streets as anti-abortion ruling finally goes into force\n\nAmong the proposals is draft legislation announced last week by United Poland (Solidarna Polska), one of two junior partners in a ruling coalition with the Law and Justice (PiS) party. The bill would create hospices to support mothers giving birth to non-viable foetuses.\nToday, the spokeswoman for the justice ministry \u2013 which is headed by Zbigniew Ziobro, leader of United Poland \u2013 was asked by broadcaster TVN24 for details of what the bill would provide for a woman giving birth to a foetus with fatal defects.\n\u201cShe will have, for example, a separate room, the chance to have a cry,\u201d replied Agnieszka Borowska. She also outlined that such women would be offered \u201cspecial care\u201d, including psychological treatment and \u201cadvice on what to do next\u201d.\n\n\nOgl\u0105da\u0142em kiedy\u015b serial w kt\u00f3rym by\u0142o podobnie, ale s\u0105dzi\u0142em wtedy \u017ce to fikcja. Nazywal si\u0119 \"Opowie\u015b\u0107 Podr\u0119cznej\". https://t.co/hrAu1uLP27\n\u2014 Micha\u0142 Kolanko (@michal_kolanko) February 3, 2021\n\nBorowska\u2019s comments quickly drew criticism from a variety of commentators. Micha\u0142 Kolanko, a political reporter for the centre-right Rzeczpospolita, wrote that the remarks reminded him of\u00a0The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\u201cI would prefer for the Polish state to do everything [possible] so that women do not have to cry,\u201d tweeted Renata Grochal, a journalist at the liberal Newsweek Polska. \u201cTabliban,\u201d wrote Joanna Mizio\u0142ek of the weekly Wprost.\nPiS has not yet publicly responded to its coalition partner\u2019s proposal. However, last week one of the party\u2019s MPs called for the government to \u201cpresent a complex support package for mothers as soon as possible\u201d. Work on such measures has been underway for months, reported Interia today.\nPiS has, however, made clear its support for the abolishment of what it calls \u201ceugenic abortions\u201d. Its leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, promised in 2016 \u201cto strive so that even in cases where there is a very difficult pregnancy, when the child will inevitably die, when it is severely deformed, it will end in birth, so the child can be christened, buried and given a name\u201d.\n\nPolice deploy force against Polish abortion protests as hospitals cancel terminations following ruling\n\nAt the opposite end of the political spectrum, The Left (Lewica), which is the second largest opposition group in parliament, has called for other opposition parties to support legislation decriminalising those who help women obtain abortions.\nAnnouncing the proposal on Monday, Magdalena Biejat, an MP, noted that hospitals have already been cancelling planned terminations. Doctors \u201cnow face the dilemma of whether to help women and thus expose themselves to criminal consequences or to violate their Hippocratic Oath\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Our] legislation will support doctors and women,\u201d said Biejat, quoted by Dziennik Gazeta Prawna. \u201cNo one will have to fear imprisonment for wanting to help women who come to a doctor with a fatal defect of the foetus. [It will ensure] that the decision belongs to the doctor and, above all, to women.\u201d\n\n\n.@MagdaBiejat: #UstawaRatunkowa autorstwa Lewicy, dekryminalizuje pomoc przy aborcji, jest w stanie pom\u00f3c lekarzom i kobietom oraz ich wesprze\u0107.\u2013 Wzywamy, aby dzisiaj rozmawia\u0107 o tej ustawie i o tym, co mo\u017cemy zrobi\u0107, aby ta ustawa zosta\u0142a przyj\u0119ta i z\u0142agodzi\u0142a efekty wyroku TK. pic.twitter.com/SDdC5gxkXI\n\u2014 Lewica News \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f\ud83d\udcfb\ud83d\udcfa (@Lewica_News) February 1, 2021\n\nWhile The Left has previously pushed for liberalisation of Poland\u2019s abortion law \u2013 which, even before the latest ruling, was the strictest in the EU apart from Malta\u2019s \u2013 the main centrist opposition has generally favoured maintaining the status quo. Polling also suggests that most Poles support neither liberalisation nor restriction of the law.\nThe largest opposition party, Civic Platform (PO), has criticised the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling, and accused PiS of using it as a way to distract from criticism over its rollout of the coronavirus vaccine and growing protests by businesses against lockdown.\nHowever, PO \u2013 a party that incorporates both liberal and conservative wings \u2013 has so far failed to present an alternative. It this week announced that it was appointing a team led by former presidential candidate Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska to work out a new position.\n\nCivic Platform turns 20: is Poland\u2019s \u201czombie party\u201d now undermining opposition to PiS?\n\n\u201cThere can be no return to the abortion compromise [the previous situation] that has been destroyed by PiS,\u201d said Urszula Augustyn, a member of PO\u2019s board, quoted by Polsat News. \u201cWe want to work out a position that will accommodate both the right and the left, a position closest to the centre.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, leader of the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050) movement that is currently third in the polls, has also expressed opposition to the Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s ruling.\nHo\u0142ownia, a devout Catholic who once began training as a priest, has in the past supported a ban on abortion, which he called \u201cmurder in all cases\u201d.\nHowever, speaking to Polsat News this week, he said that that had been a personal opinion expressed in his former career as a journalist. He has \u201cnot changed\u201d his own view, but now, as a politician \u201ctaking responsibility for the country\u201d, he respects the fact that his position is \u201cmore conservative\u201d than most.\n\nPolish opposition leader sets out plan to end \u201ccorrupting\u201d links between church and state\n\nMain image credit: Cezary Aszkielowicz / Agencja Gazeta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel TillesDaniel Tilles is editor-in-chief of\u00a0Notes from Poland.
