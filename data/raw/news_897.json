In that document, the White House vowed to \u201cprotect the constitutional right to safe and legal abortion established in Roe v. Wade.\u201d\nThat commitment included \u201csupporting the repeal of the Hyde Amendment,\u201d which bars the use of federal funds to pay for an abortion. In practice, the Hyde Amendment prevents most states\u2019 programs for Medicaid \u2014 the federal-state health insurance plan that covers low-income people \u2014 from covering abortion, which can cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheoretically, the administration has taken steps in the direction of maintaining abortion access. It submitted a budget to Congress last May that would repeal the Hyde Amendment, though in Washington, the president\u2019s budget is treated more as a signal of priorities than a serious policy proposal. It also endorsed the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a bill that would codify Roe v. Wade protections.\u00a0\nBut the impact has been minimal. While both proposals have passed the U.S. House of Representatives, they have little chance of success in the Senate. Passing legislation such as the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act requires 60 votes. Meanwhile, all 50 Democrats would need to unite to repeal the Hyde Amendment. Neither of those appears likely to happen.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Two Democratic senators \u2014\u00a0Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania \u2014 are generally unfriendly toward legislation that expands abortion access and declined to sign on in support of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act. Democrats\u2019 margin has for now become even slimmer, with Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, of New Mexico, temporarily incapacitated after a stroke.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Biden has said little publicly about the White House\u2019s stance on abortion rights.\u00a0\nThe White House did not respond to multiple requests for updates on how or when it hopes to move forward with either effort. But the looming midterm elections mean the window to pass either bill into law may be growing narrower. Democrats are considered at great risk of losing their slim governing majorities in both the House and Senate this November, though some believe a ruling by the Supreme Court that restricts abortion access could mobilize their voters.\u00a0\nSome experts suggested that, given the limited possibilities in Congress, the administration should use executive power.\n\u201cLegislative fixes are nonstarters, and every second that\u2019s spent trying to work on legislation is a second that\u2019s not being spent trying to affect access on the ground,\u201d said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Kline School of Law, who focuses on constitutional law and gender. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks legislation is going to happen, and if they do they\u2019re living in a fantasy world.\u201d\nThere are a few avenues the White House could take, suggested Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies abortion. In particular, she said, the Biden administration should rely on the the Food and Drug Administration to issue regulations that expand access to medication abortion, a two-pill regimen that people can use to safely end a pregnancy at home up until 10 weeks.\u00a0\n\u201cThe most significant thing the Biden administration has done is through the FDA, and the most significant things the Biden administration will be able to do going forward are through the FDA,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Laws restricting abortion may also limit options for people who miscarry\n                \n\n\n\n                    \u2018You never forget it\u2019: These are the stories of life before Roe v. Wade transformed America\n                \n\n\n\n                    Proposed bill would cover breastfeeding support for families fleeing natural disasters\n                \n\n\n\n\nAlready, the administration has moved in that direction.This past December, the agency loosened regulations on how one of the medication abortion pills \u2014 a drug known as mifepristone \u2014 is dispensed. Previously, the agency held that the mifepristone must be administered in-person, even though medical groups have long said that the pill can be safely taken at home.\u00a0\nThe FDA\u2019s move \u2014 initially prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic and made permanent in December \u2014 allowed for medication abortion pills to be prescribed virtually and sent to patients through the mail, eliminating numerous barriers for patients who do not have the time or resources to travel to a licensed clinic or health care facility.\u00a0\nBut without more White House action, the impact will probably be limited. So far, 19 states have laws in place that require physicians to dispense mifepristone in-person, essentially rejecting the FDA guidance. More state legislatures are preparing similar legislation. The administration could attempt to overrule those state laws, Ziegler and others said, challenging them in court and arguing that the FDA regulations, as a representation of federal law, preempt state ones.\u00a0\nThere is no precedent for using FDA guidance to overrule state limitations on medication abortion. But it\u2019s an argument that at least has a chance of succeeding in courts, legal experts said.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is some support for the idea that states cannot ban FDA-approved medication,\u201d said Greer Donley, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, who specializes in laws surrounding medication abortion access. \u201cThis is a novel legal argument. Maybe it would mean states cannot ban the sale of medication abortion, which would mean states must allow abortion up to 10 weeks.\u201d\nAbortion rights activists demonstrate outside the Supreme Court in January 2022.\n (ALEX EDELMAN/AFP/Getty Images)\nThat could take on new relevance if the Supreme Court does use its major abortion case \u2014 Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2014 to overturn or severely weaken Roe v. Wade, an outcome legal observers say is highly likely. Such a ruling would eliminate the federal abortion rights guarantee and could allow states to ban abortion entirely. A decision in the case is expected this summer.\u00a0\nIf such an argument withstood legal challenges, it could render toothless any state law that attempted to ban abortion prior to 10 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court does overrule Roe, there is more urgency for the Biden administration to pursue arguments like this,\u201d Donley added.\u00a0\nThere are other strategies the administration could explore, experts said. The Department of Health and Human Services could encourage states to use their own Medicaid funds \u2014 which are not governed by the Hyde Amendment \u2014 to cover abortion services, though it\u2019s not clear how much impact that would have.\u00a0\nCohen also suggested looking at whether the government could lease federal land to abortion clinics. In theory, those clinics could then operate within the borders of a state that has limited or even banned abortion. Since they would not be on state property, those clinics could be exempt from the state\u2019s abortion laws and instead governed by only federal statute. (Similar approaches could be tried on reservation land, if tribal leaders also sought to maintain abortion access.)\nAgain, he added, it\u2019s not guaranteed that such an approach would survive a court challenge. But it\u2019s not out of the question, either.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is possible that clinics can operate on federal lands without having to follow state law. That has to be explored.
