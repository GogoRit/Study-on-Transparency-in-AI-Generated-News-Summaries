We want women to know that we are already working to help them, and that no woman needs to stand alone.\u201d\nSusan Berry, PhD, is national education editor at The Star News Network.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIssues\n\nHealth Care\nPro-Life\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\u00a0E-NEWSLETTER\nFirst Name:*\n\nLast Name:*\n\nEmail Address:*\n\nAddress:\n\nCity:\n\nState:\n\nZip:\n\n\n* indicates a required field.\nBy completing this form, you are authorizing us to send regular e-mail updates to your e-mail account.\nIN THE NEWS\n\n\n\nSenators press for AEWR freeze\nKatie Britt Predicts GOP Senate Majority Next Year, Movement on Protecting Women\u2019s Sports\nRepublicans Block Bogus Democrat IVF Bill That Would Allow Destroying Human Embryos\n\n\n\n\nRECENT RELEASES\n\n\n\nHYDE-SMITH, COLLEAGUES CHALLENGE UNLAWFUL FCC \u2018DIGITAL EQUITY\u2019 RULES\u00a0\nHYDE-SMITH HAILS VICTORY FOR U.S. CATFISH PRODUCERS AS COMMERCE DEPT.
