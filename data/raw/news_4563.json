With the old law still on its books, Michigan is one of 28 US states that would ban or be likely to ban abortions if the US Supreme Court reverses its 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade legalising abortion rights nationwide.\nWhitmer was expected to request that the Michigan Supreme Court quickly take her case rather than let it wind through lower trial and appellate courts. A favourable decision in Whitmer\u2019s case would allow abortions to continue in Michigan even if the top federal court reverses Roe v Wade.\n\n\u201cIt was important for us to take action now, to ensure that women and providers across the state of Michigan know whether abortions will still be available in the state because it impacts their lives and our healthcare providers\u2019 practices,\u201d Whitmer told The Associated Press, saying nearly 2.2 million women may lose access to a safe, legal medical procedure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that we take this action now to secure and ensure that the Michigan Constitution protects this right that we have had available for 49 years,\u201d she said.\nMichigan\u2019s unenforced abortion ban was enacted before the 1973 Roe decision that legalised abortion. States on both sides of the abortion issue have been taking a variety of steps to prepare for Roe being eroded or rescinded, including\u00a0making it a crime\u00a0to perform an abortion or\u00a0banning legal action\u00a0against people who aid or receive an abortion.\nMichigan\u2019s law makes it a felony to use an instrument or administer any substance with the intent \u201cto procure the miscarriage\u201d of a woman unless necessary to preserve her life.\nStephen Parlato of Colorado holds a sign that reads \u2018Hands Off Roe!!!\u2019 as rights advocates and protesters demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court in December 2021 [File: Andrew Harnik/AP Photo]\nWhitmer wants the Michigan Supreme Court to declare a state constitutional right to abortion and to strike down the 1931 law, a near total ban that the governor called \u201cone of the most extreme laws in the country\u201d.\nHer lawsuit argues that the law is invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. Calls to repeal the law have gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature.\nWhitmer will ask that the court intervene in part to\u00a0avoid legal uncertainty\u00a0when the federal high court issues its ruling on Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe complaint says that while the Michigan Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that Roe limited the effect of the state ban, the right to abortion has been undermined over 50 years of litigation in federal courts. The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in 1997 that there is no constitutional right to abortion, but the state\u2019s high court has never ruled on the question.\nFormer President Donald Trump\u2019s seating of three justices gave the court a new, 6-3 conservative majority [Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo]\nAbortion rights advocates in Michigan have launched a ballot drive to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution,s but need about 425,000 voter signatures to put the initiative up to a vote in November.\nMeanwhile, seven Democratic county prosecutors who were named in Whitmer\u2019s lawsuit pledged to not enforce the anti-abortion law. The other six elected prosecutors named are Republicans.\n\u201cWe cannot and will not support criminalizing reproductive freedom or creating unsafe, untenable situations for healthcare providers and those who seek abortions in our communities,\u201d said a joint statement from the elected prosecutors of Michigan\u2019s Wayne, Oakland, Genesee, Washtenaw, Ingham, Kalamazoo, and Marquette counties.\n\u201cInstead, we will continue to dedicate our limited resources towards the prosecution of serious crimes and the pursuit of justice for all.\u201d\nWhitmer\u2019s case will be decided by four Democratic and three Republican justices on the state high court.\nSource: APaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
