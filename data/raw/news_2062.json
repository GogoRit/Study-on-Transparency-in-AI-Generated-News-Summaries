The law, Senate Bill 23-190, came with a caveat that if the state\u2019s medical board, nursing board and pharmacy board agreed that abortion reversal is a generally accepted standard of practice by Oct. 1, the procedure would remain legal.\nAs of now, the three boards have not come to that conclusion. The medical board ruled it as outside of \u201cgenerally accepted standard of practice\u201d last month, and last week the nursing and pharmacy boards declined to classify it as either unprofessional or accepted conduct. All three boards decided to review abortion reversal on a case-by-case basis.\nThat means the law will go into effect if the boards don\u2019t reverse their decisions by the Oct. 1 deadline.
