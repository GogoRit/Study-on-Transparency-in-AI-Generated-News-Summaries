In reality, the events had nothing to do with each other, and the SGA was not happy about Students for Life piggybacking off of its event. After SGA confronted them over the use of their promotional material, the conflict was then brought to administration to resolve.\u00a0\nFor Students for Life, the controversy with SGA was the climax of an eventful day that began with their pro-life exposition, their first event of the semester. The expo displayed multiple graphics on abortion and the pro-life movement as a whole.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are a fairly new organization, this is our first semester here. Really, our goal is to let people know that there are resources out there. You do not have to choose an abortion. We just want to be a voice for those that are in a rough spot in their life, and we\u2019re just here to support them,\u201d said Trent Rodriguez, the group\u2019s secretary.\u00a0\nStudents for Life is led by its president Harlee Barbier. She\u2019s been a pro-life activist since she was 15, according to the organization\u2019s Instagram page. Barbier is a volunteer coordinator for the organization Live to Love for Life, a ministry \u201cfocused on educating and empowering others to advocate in a culture of life,\u201d according to its website.\u00a0\nThe expo featured large abortion and pro-life graphics. One banner included murals of adopted celebrities including Jamie Foxx, Steve Jobs, Marilyn Monroe and Nelson Mandela, the former South African president who helped end apartheid. The graphic suggested their accomplishments would have been impossible if their moms had abortions.\nAnother graphic on display during the event featured a young man named Nik Hoot, a former high school wrestler who survived an abortion attempt that cost him his \u201cright leg, left foot, and a few of his fingers.\u201d He rose to prominence in Feb. 2013 when the Catholic News Agency chronicled his story while he was a 16-year-old sophomore attending Woodlawn High School in Woodburn, Ind. Ever since, he and other abortion survivors have served as symbols for the pro-life movement.\u00a0\nWhile many students came to learn more about the pro-life movement, not all were pleased with the display. Matty Matthews, a senator for Student Government Association, was among the students who voiced their displeasure with the organization\u2019s presence on campus.\u00a0\n\u201cI am very pro-choice. As a trans man, I understand what it\u2019s like to have your body policed. I\u2019d never put that kind of pressure on a woman, it\u2019s her body and it\u2019s her choice,\u201d Matthews said.\u00a0\nOn the other side of the issue was Louisiana Right to Life\u2019s college director and youth programs director for North Louisiana Kandace Landreneau, who led the expo. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve never met a woman who said that they were thrilled about having an abortion, that they were so excited to have an abortion. They did it because they couldn\u2019t afford it, or they were scared they were going to have to drop out of school, or things of that nature. That\u2019s a travesty. That\u2019s not a choice.\u201d\nLandreneau expressed the pro-life movement \u201cabsolutely support[s] giving resources out to women\u201d in need of assistance during pregnancy. She said they \u201cdon\u2019t take a stance\u201d on providing resources such as contraceptives, comprehensive sex education and affordable health care, though. However, according to a study done by the Guttmacher Institute, access to contraception, especially highly effective contraception, leads to a decrease in abortions.\u00a0\nAffordable health care and abortion were linked in another study by the Society for Human Resource Management, which found that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate to cover birth control and other contraceptives reduced abortion rates. Also, research from the online science forum NewsWise suggests comprehensive sex education decreases abortion rates by lowering the level of teen pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMatthews said he felt it is not \u201cappropriate for people like that to be on campus.\u201d He acknowledged Students for Life didn\u2019t verbally berate anyone during its expo, which he admits is better than other pro-life groups that have been on campus. The event\u2019s seeming warmth did nothing to change his stance on its message.\n\u201cTheir group is probably the best of the protestors coming to campus, but that isn\u2019t saying much at all. Not verbally assaulting people really shouldn\u2019t be the bare minimum,\u201d Matthews said.\u00a0\nThough its exposition was met with backlash, Students for Life intends to stay and continue the spread of pro-life ideals on campus.
