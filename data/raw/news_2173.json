But he\u2019s already dealing with anti-abortion groups and MPs tweeting out conspiracy theories. RBby Rachel BrowneAugust 31, 2020, 5:29pmShareTweetSnapConservative Leader Erin O'Toole holds his first news conference as leader on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean KilpatrickErin O\u2019Toole became the new leader of the Conservative Party of Canada one week ago, declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s time for more Canadians to look at the Conservative Party again.\u201dTo help with that, O\u2019Toole has tried to pitch himself, and the party, as open to all Canadians.\u201cWhether you are Black, white, brown or from any race or creed, whether you are LGBT or straight,\u201d O\u2019Toole said during his victory speech. (Although he wouldn\u2019t say whether he believes systemic racism exists in Canada during an interview on Sunday with Global News.)AdvertisementAnd O\u2019Toole is already grappling with a number of tests to his leadership, including balancing the social conservative base that contributed to the downfall of former leader Andrew Scheer, dealing with a Twitter controversy involving caucus members sharing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and introducing himself to Canadians, and the world, as a serious alternative to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with the possibility that an election could be called as early as this fall.After O\u2019Toole became leader, the more progressive wing of the party rejoiced that O\u2019Toole repeated his pro-choice stance, and said that he would champion LGBTQ+ rights. It was starkly different from Scheer who had refused to march in Pride parades and had previously opposed same-sex marriage.Moments after O\u2019Toole won the leadership race, Conservative Alberta MP Michelle Rempel Garner tweeted she was \u201cfeeling renewed and excited.\u201d O\u2019Toole \u201cclearly articulated his position on women\u2019s and LGBTQ rights right up front\u2014full support and proud of his voting record. YASSS! More of this!\u201d she said.Yet O\u2019Toole made a concerted effort to court the party\u2019s social conservative base throughout his leadership campaign, leaning as far right as possible, and vowing to \u201cTake Back Canada.\u201dNow that he\u2019s leader, the so-cons have high expectations that O\u2019Toole and the party will support their goals when it comes to a range of moral issues, including restricting funding for abortions abroad. But this vocal cohort is likely a stumbling block for O\u2019Toole as he tries to unite the party and attract support from the majority of Canadians who may not share these same moral preoccupations.Advertisement\u201cThere's this real dissonance between the party members, particularly the social conservatives within the party, and the broader electorate,\u201d said Lori Williams, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Calgary. And O\u2019Toole\u2019s allyship with them could make him vulnerable.NewsJustin Trudeau\u2019s Billion-Dollar  Scandal Is a Story of Power, Branding, and Charity Justin Ling07.22.20One of the groups that\u2019s keeping a close eye on O\u2019Toole and the party is the anti-abortion group RightNow, formed in the wake of the 2015 election with the sole mission of electing federal candidates who identify as \u201cpro-life.\u201d RightNow claims they sold at least 10,000 Conservative Party memberships during this leadership race alone.Leslyn Lewis, a Toronto lawyer and unabashed social conservative who ran on an anti-abortion platform, was the group\u2019s first choice for leader followed by rookie MP Derek Sloan, who\u2019s also anti-abortion and known for spouting far-right rhetoric. O\u2019Toole was propelled to first place because half of Lewis\u2019 60,000 supporters named him their second choice over perceived frontrunner Peter MacKay, who earlier this year described Andrew Scheer\u2019s social conservatism as a \u201cstinking albatross\u201d around his neck.Scott Hayward, RightNow\u2019s co-founder, told VICE News that O\u2019Toole has the backing of social conservatives\u2014in spite of being pro-choice\u2014for a number of reasons: he didn\u2019t insult them like MacKay did; he\u2019ll allow MPs to raise issues that are important to them, including \u201cpro-life\u201d ones; he would allow MPs to vote freely on \u201cpro-life\u201d matters; his Conservative government wouldn\u2019t allocate any foreign aid for abortion services; and he would oppose the Liberals\u2019 attempts to expand the criteria for medical assistance in dying.Advertisement\u201cThose five things are the red line for pro-lifers in the party,\u201d Hayward said. He pointed to O\u2019Toole\u2019s interview with RightNow earlier this year in which O\u2019Toole said: \u201cI do not think that abortion services should be part of our foreign aid funding in any way.\u201d I think he's going to present a formidable challenge to Justin TrudeauLast year, Trudeau announced his government would increase international aid for women\u2019s health to $1.4 billion a year, half of which would be earmarked for safe abortion and reproductive health services.In that same interview with RightNow, O\u2019Toole said he values \u201cthe pro-lifers in our party\u201d and respects \u201ctheir important role in our movement.\u201d Hayward clearly agrees, adding that the social conservatives aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201cIt\u2019s alive and well. It\u2019s growing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe'd much rather work with (O\u2019Toole) and his team on those five points, accomplishing them, than having to deal with them backtracking on it, which at this point, we have no indication they would.\u201dAnother anti-abortion group, Campaign Life Coalition, the largest in the country, claims it brought in more than 26,000 members, and has launched a petition calling on O\u2019Toole to put Sloan in his shadow cabinet. Lewis announced she\u2019ll run for the party during the next election somewhere in Ontario or Western Canada, and will announce which riding sometime this week.Last weekend, O\u2019Toole and the party faced a flare-up over a now-deleted tweet by British Columbia MP Kerry-Lynne Findlay who had retweeted a 2009 clip of Liberal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland interviewing billionaire philanthropist George Soros when she worked as a journalist with the Financial Times.AdvertisementOn Saturday, Findlay tweeted that Canadians should be alarmed by the \u201ccloseness\u201d between Freeland and Soros, who is Jewish, and frequently referenced in anti-Semitic and far-right conspiracy theories.After hours of outcry, Findlay, the party\u2019s environment critic, deleted the retweet and apologized.\u201cI thoughtlessly shared content from what I am now learning is a source that promotes hateful conspiracy theories,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have removed the tweets and apologize to anyone who thinks I would want to endorse hateful rhetoric.\u201dMP Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative\u2019s finance critic, re-tweeted Findlay\u2019s now deleted tweet, but it\u2019s gone from his page and he hasn\u2019t commented since.NewsJustin Trudeau's Past Comes Back to Haunt Him as He Shuts Down ParliamentAnya Zoledziowski08.18.20However, Findlay\u2019s apology was not enough for Charles Adler, a high-profile conservative radio host who chastised O\u2019Toole, a frequent guest of his, for not condemning or sanctioning Findlay. It should be noted that O\u2019Toole\u2019s campaign was largely led by Jeff Ballingall, a political consultant behind the vehemently anti-Trudeau Ontario Proud and Canada Proud Facebook pages and co-owner of right-wing media site The Post Millennial, which has been criticized for spreading misinformation.\u201cThe Erin O'Toole I used to know would have unhesitatingly condemned the old #antisemitic libel about wealthy Jewish financiers controlling governments around the world,\u201d Adler tweeted in a 19-post thread on Sunday.Adler had been disillusioned with the party for years, but said this was the end.Advertisement\u201cIt's now blindingly obvious to me that calling myself a Canadian conservative is nothing more than an exercise in self delusion,\u201d Adler wrote. \u201cAnd so on this day, August 30th 2020, let's make it official. I am no longer a conservative.\u201dWhen asked about Findlay\u2019s tweets and Adler\u2019s thread, O\u2019Toole spokesperson Kelsie Chiasson sent VICE News a single sentence by email: \u201cMP Findlay has removed the tweets and apologized.\u201dGarnett Genuis, Conservative MP for Sherwood Park\u2014Fort Saskatchewan, told VICE News that \u201cif we want to move forward together and effectively deal with problems of misinformation online, I think we need to work to identify those problems when they happen while extending grace to people, instead of cancelling anybody who makes an honest mistake.\u201dAlthough he doesn\u2019t have much brand recognition within the Conservatives, let alone outside of it, O\u2019Toole\u2019s next moves will make or break his reputation, and determine whether he can succeed where his predecessor failed. While the party won the popular vote, it did not garner enough support in Ontario and Quebec, where the majority of the seats in the House of Commons reside. Critics blamed party infighting and Scheer\u2019s history of conservatism as the main reasons why Scheer was unable to overtake the Liberals, especially as they were embroiled in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, and multiple images of Trudeau in blackface emerged during the campaign.AdvertisementFor University of Saskatchewan political science professor Greg Poelzer, O\u2019Toole\u2019s platform signals O\u2019Toole is taking a different direction from Scheer with promises that include guaranteeing clean drinking water \u201cfor every Indigenous community in Canada\u201d and proposals on the environment. However, O\u2019Toole has also promised to \u201cfight the carbon tax with every last breath.\u201d\u201cHe is moving the Conservative Party much more to the mainstream than it was under Andrew Scheer,\u201d Poelzer said.Poelzer added O\u2019Toole has the potential to be more successful than Stephen Harper, who served as Conservative Prime Minister for nearly 10 years before Trudeau.\u201cI think he's going to present a formidable challenge to Justin Trudeau. The challenge he's got, of course, is most Canadians don't really know him,\u201d Poelzer said.An Ipsos survey conducted just before the leadership race found that 68 percent of Canadians didn\u2019t know enough about O\u2019Toole to come up with an informed opinion about him\u2014and a majority of party members were not familiar with him.NewsErin O\u2019Toole Is the New Conservative Leader of Canada. But Who Is He?Mack Lamoureux08.24.20Alanna Clark, a senior consultant at Earnscliffe Strategy Group and organizer for O\u2019Toole\u2019s leadership campaign, told VICE News that the most important thing for O\u2019Toole now is to be able to define himself before his opponents have the chance to do so.\u201cIn the last election, we saw the Conservatives completely shut out of basically every major urban centre in the country,\u201d Clark said, adding that O\u2019Toole will have to find ways to appeal to urban and suburban regions.\u201cThat\u2019s going to mean having an answer to climate policy. It\u2019s going to mean\u2026 not being a scary conservative with a hidden agenda, which he is not, but finding a way to communicate that to people.\u201dFollow Rachel Browne on Twitter.
