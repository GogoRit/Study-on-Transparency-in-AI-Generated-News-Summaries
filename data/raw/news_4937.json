(Kevin J. Parks/CR Staff)\u2018Dismantle Roe v. Wade\u2019 is anthem at Maryland March for Life 2022\n February 4, 2022By Priscila Gonz\u00e1lez de Doran Catholic Review\n\nFiled Under: Feature, Local News, Maryland General Assembly, News, Respect Life\n\n\nANNAPOLIS \u2013 Anticipating the fall of Roe v. Wade, many of the more than 250 people who participated in the Feb. 3 Maryland March for Life said the pro-life movement across the country must be ready to help mothers in need.\nIn Maryland, which has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the country, a decision by the Supreme Court to turn the abortion issue back to the states isn\u2019t likely to affect existing statutes. But an influx of pregnant women coming from other states seeking abortions could become a reality should other states ban the procedure.\nLynn Watts, director of the respect life ministry at Our Lady of the Fields in Millersville for 10 years, attended the Maryland March for Life with her husband and spoke of the progress of the Archdiocese of Baltimore\u2019s \u201cWalking with Moms in Need\u201d outreach to women in crisis pregnancies.\u00a0\nWatts said it will take changing hearts to change the \u201cculture of death\u201d mentality in the state.\n\u201cMany women had an abortion because they felt they had no choice,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if they had the help, understanding, compassion and love they needed, maybe they would not have felt coerced.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA group of approximately 250 pro-life supporters braved a cold and rainy Feb. 3, 2022, at the Maryland State House in Annapolis for the annual Maryland March for Life. (Kevin J. Parks/CR Staff)\n\nShe said she hopes her parish can \u201cbecome a beacon of refuge and compassion for moms so they don\u2019t feel they have to make the choice of abortion.\u201d\nCurrently there are 10 active members in Our Lady of the Fields\u2019 \u201cWalking with Moms in Need\u201d ministry. The team visited all the pregnancy centers in the area, talked to different organizations, did research on resources and set up an inventory for assisting mothers and their babies.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s Maryland March for Life was \u201cUnited for Life.\u201d The prayerful demonstration is always timed to coincide with the legislative session in Maryland, which runs this year from Jan. 12 to April 11.\nDue to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, this year\u2019s march did not include the traditional respect life Mass at St. Mary in Annapolis. There was also no procession through the streets of the capital.\nInstead, participants gathered for a rally outside the statehouse featuring pro-life speakers and prayers led by a variety of religious leaders. Those in attendance then proceeded to the sidewalk to show their pro-life signs while they shouted \u201cWe are the pro-life generation!\u201d\nThe crowd was enthusiastic about the Dobbs v. Jackson case now being considered by the Supreme Court, with many expressing optimism that a favorable ruling will overturn Roe v. Wade. Many in attendance also participated in the national March for Life in January.\nFrancis \u201cFrank\u201d Arlinghaus and his wife Susan \u201cSue\u201d Arlinghaus, the Knights of Columbus State Pro-Life Couple and parishioners for 22 years of St. Louis in Clarksville, were among the marchers. They lead the respect life committee at St. Louis and have served in the pro-life movement for 40 years.\n\u201cI expect the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade in some form, but it will make more of a difference in other states than (in) Maryland,\u201d Francis Arlinghaus said.\nHe highlighted the hostility of Maryland\u2019s legislature when it comes taking what he called \u201ccommon sense\u201d votes, such as for the protection of women as patients and retricting late-term abortions.\u00a0\n\nKevin and Donna Scott, parishioners of St. Philip Neri in Linthicum, attend the Feb. 3, 2022, Maryland March for Life at the Maryland State House in Annapolis. (Kevin J. Parks/CR Staff)\n\n\u201cWithin the Catholic Church, people need to recognize the truth of the catechism which reflects God\u2019s teaching: We believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death,\u201d he said.\nHis son, Peter Arlinghaus, looks forward to starting a pro-life club at Marriotts Ridge High School in Marriottsville. Peter Arlinghaus said Catholics need to \u201ctake their faith out of the church and into the streets.\u201d\nKacie Swann is a freshman from Mount de Sales Academy in Catonsville and a volunteer at Mary\u2019s Home Maryland in Ellicott City, an outreach to pregnant women.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to help all these single moms who are struggling with their lives and need some help to get back on track,\u201d she said. \u201cThe moms are really sweet and appreciative of everything you do for them. They\u2019re determined to have a good rest of their life.\u201d\nFathers Matthew DeFusco, associate pastor at St. Margaret in Bel Air; Andrew DeFusco, pastor of St. Andrew by the Bay in Annapolis; and Jeremy J. Smith, associate pastor of Immaculate Conception Church in Towson, attended the march together.\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, demonstrations such as the Maryland March for Life could have a great impact on local voters, Father Matthew DeFusco said.\nSandra Nettina is a nurse practitioner and parishioner of St. Paul in Ellicott City whose job focuses on house calls for the homebound elderly. She is an activist in the coalition against physician-assisted suicide, collaborating with the Maryland Catholic Conference and Maryland Right to Life.\n\u201cFamilies get all these messages from the outside like \u2018the older person is a burden\u2019 or \u2018having a baby is a burden,\u2019 and yet I see a tremendous amount of love in the families caring for their elderly relatives,\u201d she noted. \u201cWe need people speaking of the dignity of the elderly and sharing their stories.\u201d\nEven though steady rain was expected during the march, there was barely any.\u00a0\nThe march participants held the newly-adopted international pro-life flag and an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe as the protector of unborn children. Some held signs had messages such as \u201cDefund Planned Parenthood,\u201d \u201cPray to end abortion\u201d and \u201cLove them both.\u201d\u00a0\nA message proclaiming \u201cDismantle Roe v. Wade\u201d was projected onto the Maryland State House facing the crowd.\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail Priscila Gonz\u00e1lez de Doran at pdoran@CatholicReview.org\n\nRead More Respect Life\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. bishops urge prayer as high court poised to hear cases on pill used in abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life group deplores Harris\u2019 historic visit to Planned Parenthood abortion clinic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody of preterm baby found in Virginia pond prompts prayers, resource reminders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople touched by adoption look to St. Joseph in national novena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarchers at Maryland March for Life call for defeat of constitutional amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSister of murdered French priest tells story of forgiveness, friendship with killer\u2019s mother\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Catholic Review Media\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nPriscila Gonz\u00e1lez de Doran\n\nA native of Mexico, Priscila Gonz\u00e1lez de Doran is a former staff writer for the Catholic Review.
