Photo via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anti-abortion doctor attempting to restore Arizona\u2019s near-total abortion ban has no legal standing in the case and his petition should be rejected by the court, according to Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes.\u00a0\nLast December, the state\u2019s appeals court upheld a 2022 law that prohibits most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy over a near-total ban from 1864. That decision came after a year of turmoil as elected officials and abortion providers in Arizona battled over the procedure\u2019s legality following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that eliminated its status as a constitutional right. But in March, anti-abortion law firm Alliance Defending Freedom asked the Arizona Supreme Court to overturn the appellate court\u2019s opinion and outlaw all abortions except in life-saving emergencies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nMayes, whose predecessor Republican Mark Brnovich fought to reinstate the territorial ban, refused to defend his position. The Democrat, a staunch abortion advocate, campaigned on the promise to protect reproductive rights. Instead, the appeal to the state supreme court is headed by Dr. Eric Hazelrigg, medical director for Choices Pregnancy Centers, a chain of anti-abortion clinics in the Valley. Hazelrigg was admitted into the case in the early stages at Brnovich\u2019s request as the \u201cguardian ad litem\u201d\u00a0 for unborn fetuses, a position created in 1971.\u00a0\nJane Roe brought the original lawsuit in 1971, challenging the state\u2019s abortion ban to gain access to the procedure. A doctor was appointed as guardian ad litem to represent her unborn fetus and \u201call others similarly situated\u201d. While the case was later abandoned after the high court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, last year\u2019s events revived it. But circumstances are substantially different, and Hazelrigg doesn\u2019t have the authority to submit an appeal, Mayes said in the most recent filing.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Court should be wary of overturning a well-reasoned decision on an issue of great public importance when no proper party seeks to review,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0\nFirst, Mayes argued, the legal criteria for a guardian ad litem are narrowly defined in state law and Hazelrigg\u2019s position doesn\u2019t meet them. Guardians are appointed to represent the interests of specific plaintiffs under specific conditions, such as for minors when asked to stand trial or if they seek emancipation or an abortion without parental permission. At times, they may be selected to represent several plaintiffs in agreement with each other. Hazelrigg, however, purports to speak for an undefined population of unborn fetuses in Arizona, without regard to whether or not conflicts of interests exist. Some fetuses, Mayes pointed out, suffer life-threatening conditions that guarantee an early death.\u00a0\n\u201cThe class of\u2026unborn fetuses plainly is not homogenous,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt a minimum, the variety of medical characteristics and risks unique to any given pregnancy guarantees that not all fetuses share common circumstances and interests.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd the initial guardian appointment in 1971 itself disqualifies Hazelrigg. At the time, the guardian was charged with representing Roe\u2019s unborn fetus, as well as other fetuses \u201csimilarly situated\u201d, but there\u2019s no pregnant woman seeking an abortion in the renewed case. The issue was brought instead by then-Attorney General Brnovich and challenged by abortion provider Planned Parenthood of Arizona.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no plaintiff seeking an abortion, and therefore no individual fetus or \u2018similarly situated\u2019 fetuses for (Hazelrigg) to represent. How can there be a guardian when there are no wards?\u201d Mayes asked.\nIn the end, she said, Hazelrigg is nothing more than a bystander upset with the outcome of the state appellate court\u2019s ruling. And allowing his appeal sets a dangerous precedent for a flurry of future challenges from people with moral objections to court decisions.\u00a0\nMayes noted that other parties with more standing had the opportunity to intervene in the case but chose not to. Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen and Speaker Ben Toma have both taken up the state\u2019s position to defend laws they helped pass when Mayes refused to, including abortion laws. Besides Hazelrigg, only Yavapai County Attorney Dennis McGrane has filed a petition to represent the state\u2019s interest, which Mayes has asked the court to dismiss as an unwarranted attempt to overrule the state\u2019s actual position, which she represents.\u00a0\n\u201cThe fact that no party involved in the law-making process or with a direct interest has sought review in this case should give the Court serious pause about entertaining a request to resurrect an extreme law from a time before women could vote,\u201d she wrote.\nIn an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood of Arizona agreed with Mayes\u2019 reasoning, adding that the initial conflict between the 2022 law and the 1864 ban has already been satisfactorily resolved by the appeals court. The three judge-panel, confronted with confusion about which law should reign supreme, ruled that women can access elective abortions up to 15 weeks and the 1864 ban applies to non-physicians who might perform abortions and not pregnant women themselves. That ruling harmonized the two conflicting statutes and avoided nullifying decades of abortion regulations passed since the 1864 law was in place.\u00a0\nHazelrigg, said PPAZ spokesman Andrew Feldman, doesn\u2019t bring up new issues and the state supreme court should refuse to entertain his allegations.\u00a0\n\u201cAs we have said before, the intervenor\u2019s petition is a last-ditch effort to ignore the well-reasoned decision of the Court of Appeals \u2014 which follows Arizona law \u2014 and what is best for Arizonan\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cThere is nothing for the Arizona state Supreme Court to engage in.\u201d\nBut Kevin Theriot, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, refuted the claim that Hazelrigg\u2019s appeal is groundless, saying his position as a voice for unborn fetuses is essential.\u00a0\n\u201cThose children deserve an advocate. While Attorney General Mayes has made clear that she is only willing to push extreme policies that benefit abortion businesses, Dr. Hazelrigg is ideally situated to represent the unborn children of Arizona and defend Arizona\u2019s pro-life law,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXMayes: Effort to revive Arizona\u2019s abortion ban should be dismissed\nby Gloria Rebecca Gomez, Arizona Mirror May 4, 2023\nMayes: Effort to revive Arizona\u2019s abortion ban should be dismissed\nby Gloria Rebecca Gomez, Arizona Mirror May 4, 2023\n The anti-abortion doctor attempting to restore Arizona\u2019s near-total abortion ban has no legal standing in the case and his petition should be rejected by the court, according to Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes.\u00a0\nLast December, the state\u2019s appeals court upheld a 2022 law that prohibits most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy over a near-total ban from 1864.
