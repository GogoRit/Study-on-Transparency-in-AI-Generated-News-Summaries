They predicted the ban, which followed the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, would motivate voters to kick out Republican lawmakers.\nIn some places, that may have been the case. Voters in California, Michigan and Vermont added abortion protection to their state constitutions. In Kentucky and Montana, voters rejected anti-abortion amendments.\u00a0\n \n\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter.

In state Senate races, the only Democratic win was for Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, the sole Democrat in that chamber to support the ban. Democratic Delegate Barbara Fleischauer, a longtime vocal supporter of abortion rights, lost her bid for a Senate seat to Republican Mike Oliverio, who is anti-abortion.\u00a0\nAcross the country, high youth turnout tipped some races to Democrats. But not in West Virginia.There were 49% fewer young West Virginians voting early and absentee during this year\u2019s election, compared with the 2018 midterms. For voters of all other ages, that decline was just 22%, according to data from the West Virginia Secretary of State. And a typical young West Virginian was five times less likely to vote early or absentee than folks from other age groups.\u00a0\nCounties where early and absentee voting declined among young voters, compared to 2018\n\n\n \n\nMap by Ellie Heffernan.

But there\u2019s no evidence to suggest young West Virginians vote in disproportionately high numbers on Election Day, compared to early voting.\nMatt Jacobsmeier, a political science professor at West Virginia University who specializes in political behavior, said he\u2019s pretty confident that a lack of competitive races contributed to voter apathy.\u00a0\n\u201cPeople might be more likely to vote if they think there\u2019s a decent chance that their vote is actually going to make a difference in the outcome of the election,\u201d Jacobsmeier said. \u201cAnd when one party is so dominant in the state, a lot of people unfortunately might be thinking, well, you know, my vote is not going to do much, and they stay home for that reason.\u201d\nEven if folks were motivated to vote for pro-abortion rights candidates, many of the statehouse races between Democrats and Republicans weren\u2019t considered competitive, Jacobsmeier said. And in over a fifth of last Tuesday\u2019s statehouse races, no Democrat ran.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nrelated stories\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWest Virginia 2022 election: Republicans expand majorities, amendments defeated \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe West Virginia statehouse races where abortion is on the ballot \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2018Keep the door closed\u2019: Inside the chaotic week when West Virginia Republicans\u2019 efforts to ban abortion stalled \n\n\n\nChairman of the state Democratic Party Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, said Republican redistricting also helped make races less competitive. He said that\u2019s part of the reason the party struggled to find candidates to run in certain races.\n\u201cThe places where we felt were even less competitive, it\u2019s a lot to ask somebody out there and run when the cards are stacked against them,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nBut just making sure that a Democrat runs in each race likely won\u2019t be enough to motivate more young people \u2014 and West Virginians of all ages to turn out. Platforms matter too.\u00a0\nHayley Boso, a Democratic voter and graphic designer from Morgantown, said she believes the party didn\u2019t focus enough on progressive issues that could unify working-class West Virginians.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a party of catering to the wealthy people, and not focusing on the workers,\u201d Boso said. \u201cI feel like ever since the 90s, whenever Bill Clinton won, they\u2019ve tried to pivot to be just like Republicans, but with abortions and no guns. And that\u2019s clearly not working. But they won\u2019t give that up.\u201d\nJacobsmeier said survey research from the Pew Research Center shows abortion wasn\u2019t always the most important issue on registered voters\u2019 minds, even among Democrats. Overall, those surveyed cared more about the economy, gun policy, education and health care. Abortion was more of a priority among Democrats, but it still wasn\u2019t right at the top of their list.\u00a0\nWhile statehouse Republicans were able to overcome most Democratic opposition to pass this year\u2019s abortion ban, adding any additional restrictions will be easier next time around, now that the party controls 118 of the 134 seats in the House and Senate.\n\n\nREAD MORE\n\nFederal judges ask West Virginia Supreme Court to weigh in on opioids caseMarch 18th, 2024\nWest Virginia regulators agree to consider whether Corridor H could \u2018go north,\u2019 amid push from community groupsMarch 15th, 2024\nThe federal government gave West Virginia $525,000 to prevent gun deaths.
