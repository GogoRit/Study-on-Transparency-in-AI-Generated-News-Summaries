The study, which examined 239 pregnancies with one of 18 malformations typically considered fatal between 2013 and 2018, appears in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Global Reports.\nIn explaining why they took up their research, Viterna and co-authors Carolina Mena Ugarte and Mar\u00eda Virginia Rodr\u00edguez Funes, wrote that a \u201cstriking number of national and subnational governments that previously allowed legal abortion in cases of severe fetal anomaly\u201d had passed laws to remove the allowances, but that little was known about the maternal health implications.\nViterna, who has spent nearly 10 years researching reproductive justice in the small Central American country, says she sees some parallels between issues raised by the research in El Salvador and those arising in the U.S. as several states have tightened restrictions on abortion after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. In both countries, doctors are forced to follow a course of care that elevates the risk of health complications for pregnant patients to protect themselves from prosecution, she said.\n\u201cThe more time I spend working on cases in El Salvador, the more I\u2019m convinced that we cannot legislate abortion,\u201d said Viterna, a professor of sociology. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to legally define viability. There\u2019s no way to legally define the exact moment when a woman\u2019s life is in danger or not. Pregnancy on its own is high-risk. Anytime someone is pregnant, it brings risks to the health and to the life of the pregnant person.\u201d\nSandra Carolina Mena Ugarte collects data in the National Women\u2019s Hospital. Photo by Jocelyn Viterna\t\t\t\nLike many Latin American nations, El Salvador banned abortion except in three scenarios: when the life of the mother was at risk, when the fetus had an anomaly incompatible with life, or if the pregnancy was the result of rape. That changed in the 1990s, when the anti-abortion movement in the heavily Catholic nation began to press for major changes. Abortion became illegal in all circumstances in 1998.\nThe study was sparked by conversations Viterna had with Mena, who expressed frustration over the lack of research into the effects of fatal fetal malformations on maternal health.\n\u201cHer sense was that pregnant women were suffering significant health costs, both physical and psychological, by being required to carry to term nonviable pregnancies,\u201d the sociologist said. The research tested Mena\u2019s hypothesis, and found high rates of negative health outcomes across the entire study population.\n\u201cThe more time I spend working on cases in El Salvador, the more I\u2019m convinced that we cannot legislate abortion.\u201d\nJocelyn Viterna, professor of sociology\nAfter examining six years of cases at the National Women\u2019s Hospital in the capital city of San Salvador, the researchers found that there was at least one serious pregnancy-related health complication in 54.9 percent of the cases that involved severe fetal malformations. Additionally, 47.9 percent required physically invasive medical procedures \u2014 including fetal head decompressions, decompression amniocenteses, cesarean deliveries, and a hysterectomy \u2014 to manage complications.\nOverwhelmingly, the cases involved individuals who were low-income, poorly educated, and young. Nearly 40 percent were first pregnancies, and 75 percent were unplanned, she said. Pregnant people with financial resources in El Salvador typically do not seek health care at the public National Women\u2019s Hospital, opting instead for private providers.\nThe researchers also discovered a range of clinical treatments within the same institution, which suggests physicians interpreted the abortion ban differently. Physicians defied the law in 10 cases, and induced labor in those patients before the pregnancy reached 37 weeks (full term). In 21 cases, doctors did not induce early and went as far as treating the fetus as viable even though it had been diagnosed with a fatal malformation. Pregnant patients in 21 cases discontinued treatment after receiving the diagnosis of fatal fetal malformation.\n\u201cForcing these women to carry these pregnancies to term not only is tremendously psychologically damaging for the woman, it\u2019s also tremendously physically damaging for the woman,\u201d Viterna added. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about this that seems humane to me, especially considering the painful deaths that these babies frequently suffer after birth.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tShare this article\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail article\n\n\n\nPrint/PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might like\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nIt may be neither higher nor intelligence\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReligious scholars examine value, limits of AI\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nBolsonaro, Trump election cases share similarities, but not rulings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFormer Brazilian judge, legal scholar says deciding who can be blocked from running is perilous, fraught\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tNation & World\t\t\nDark concerns over upcoming vote in world\u2019s largest democracy\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSocial scientists discuss controversial Indian prime minister Modi, rise of right-wing populism, erosion of political journalism\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 min read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tArts & Culture\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo what exactly makes Taylor Swift so great?\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExperts weigh in on pop superstar's cultural and financial impact as her tours and albums continue to break records.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCampus & Community\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn the first day of Christmas \u2026 we partied like it was 1499\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChurch historian traces celebration\u2019s path from wild revelry through Puritan\u2019s progress to Hallmark holiday\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlong read\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHealth\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 20-minute workout\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPressed for time?
