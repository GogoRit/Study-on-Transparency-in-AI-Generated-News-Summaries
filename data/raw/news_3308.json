Wade Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.Going forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.

Joe Manchin said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed that the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade,\" and he was \"alarmed\" that justices pulled back from their testimonies that it was settled law.  \"It has been the law of the land for nearly 50 years and was understood to be settled precedent. I trusted Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh when they testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans,\" Manchin said in a statement. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs a Catholic, I was raised pro-life and will always consider myself pro-life. But I have come to accept that my definition of pro-life may not be someone else\u2019s definition of pro-life. I believe that exceptions should be made in instances of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. But let me be clear, I support legislation that would codify the rights Roe v. Wade previously protected. I am hopeful Democrats and Republicans will come together to put forward a piece of legislation that would do just that,\u201d he added. Over in the House of Representatives, Rep. Henry Cuellar, a rare Democrat who opposes abortion rights and narrowly survived his primary against a progressive challenger, was positive on Friday's ruling.\u00a0Cuellar had the backing of Democratic leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in his primary.\u00a0Cuellar said he still has the \"same position I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m pro-life.\"\u00a0When CNN's Manu Raju pointed out that he is in the minority of his caucus on this issue, he replied, \"in my district I'm not.\"\u00a0share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:09 p.m. ET, June 24, 2022US Attorney General Garland says DOJ \"strongly disagrees\" with SCOTUS decisionUS Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks on June 8 in Washington, DC.  (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201cThe Supreme Court has eliminated an established right that has been an essential component of women\u2019s liberty for half a century \u2013 a right that has safeguarded women\u2019s ability to participate fully and equally in society. And in renouncing this fundamental right, which it had repeatedly recognized and reaffirmed, the Court has upended the doctrine of\u00a0stare decisis, a key pillar of the rule of law,\" according to the statement from Garland. \u201cThe Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Court\u2019s decision. This decision deals a devastating blow to reproductive freedom in the United States. It will have an immediate and irreversible impact on the lives of people across the country. And it will be greatly disproportionate in its effect \u2013 with the greatest burdens felt by people of color and those of limited financial means,\" he said. Garland reiterated that the decision today does not ban states to keep abortion legal within their borders.\u201cWe recognize that traveling to obtain reproductive care may not be feasible in many circumstances. But under bedrock constitutional principles, women who reside in states that have banned access to comprehensive reproductive care must remain free to seek that care in states where it\u00a0is legal.\u00a0Moreover, under fundamental First Amendment principles, individuals must remain free to inform and counsel each other about the reproductive care that is available in other states,\" he said. \u201cAdvocates with different views on this issue have the right to, and will, voice their opinions. Peacefully expressing a view is protected by the First Amendment. But we must be clear that violence and threats of violence are not. The Justice Department will not tolerate such acts,\" he continued. The DOJ \"will work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom\" and \"strongly supports efforts by Congress to codify Americans\u2019 reproductive rights,\" according to his statement. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:04 p.m. ET, June 24, 2022SCOTUS opinion to overturn Roe v.

Warren on Roe v. Wade decision: \"The Supreme Court does not get\u00a0the last word, the people do\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks with CNN on Friday.  (CNN)Sen. Elizabeth Warren said there are ways now to \"fight back\" against the ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, accusing Supreme Court justices of not staying true to their words when they were nominees. \"I am spitting mad over this.\u00a0We have six extremist justices\u00a0on the United States Supreme\u00a0Court who have decided that\u00a0their moral and religious views\u00a0should be imposed on the rest of\u00a0America.\u00a0This is not what America wants,\" Warren told CNN's Erica Hill. \"And in a democracy on this issue,\u00a0the Supreme Court does not get\u00a0the last word, the people do.\u00a0We are going to fight back.\u00a0We've got tools.\u00a0We're going to use them and in\u00a0November, we're going to make\u00a0sure that we elect enough people\u00a0who believe in that democracy\u00a0that we can pass Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the\u00a0land again \u2014 only this time we'll do it by\u00a0statute and enforce it,\" Warren said. She said justices, when they were appointees, promised to follow the law \"but wink, wink, nod, nod,\u00a0were cleared in order to get\u00a0where they got today.\"\"One Supreme Court nominee after\u00a0another stood in front of\u00a0Congress, raised their right\u00a0hand and said 'not interfering\u00a0with settled law, I believe in the rule of law' and\u00a0said Roe v. Wade is settled\u00a0law.\u00a0That means that a huge\u00a0proportion of the population in\u00a0America believed this is not a\u00a0huge issue,\" she said. Warren also said that the midterm elections in November will have a focus on abortion. \"It looks like getting two\u00a0more Democrats in the United\u00a0States Senate who are willing to\u00a0support both filibuster reform\u00a0and making Roe v. Wade the\u00a0law of the land.\u00a0It means hanging onto the House\u00a0of Representatives and it means passing\u00a0Roe into law.\u00a0That's what November will be all\u00a0about,\" she said. Warren said that she and Sen. Patty Murray led a letter with more than half of Democratic senators calling on President Biden to take immediate federal action to strengthen abortion rights. \"He can make medicated abortion\u00a0more widely available.\u00a0He can help with money and time\u00a0off for people to be able to\u00a0move across state lines.\u00a0He can consider using federal\u00a0lands as a place where we can\u00a0set up abortion clinics,\" she said.

Chris Smith of New Jersey \u2013 one of the GOP\u2019s leading anti-abortion voices who said the issue is what inspired him to run for office \u2013 said he\u2019s planning to lower his proposed 20-week abortion ban down to 15 weeks in light of the Supreme Court eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion.\u00a0Smith is the chief sponsor of \u201cThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d which would\u00a0ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. The bill has previously passed the House when Republicans were in power, and the GOP has pointed to that measure as a piece of legislation they would like to again put on the floor if they regain control of the chamber next year.But Smith said he\u2019s planning to make the ban stricter.\u201cWe\u2019re working on something along those lines,\u201d Smith said, when asked by CNN about a nationwide abortion ban. \u201cI have the Pain Capable at 20 weeks. We\u2019re going to lower it to 15. There are all kinds of ideas there.\u201d\u201cBut we don\u2019t have at this point the ability to overcome a veto or a filibuster,\u201d he added.In anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v Wade, House Republicans have started discussing what anti-abortion bills they would put on the floor if they win the majority and have used recent closed-door party meetings to discuss their messaging and strategy on abortion.\u00a0CNN reported that earlier this month, the head of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List addressed a House GOP conference meeting, where she talked to members about how to message on the issue and encouraged members to take incremental steps toward banning abortion if they win the majority.\u00a0Besides\u00a0the 20-week ban bill, there is also a stricter measure in the House that would prohibit abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which has more than 100 Republican co-sponsors in the House.\u00a0Top House Republicans, however, have been wary to push for stricter, nationwide abortion bans\u00a0and are instead expected to focus their messaging on calling for bans on so-called late term abortions, which are rare. But Republicans feel like it\u2019s a more popular message and that polling is on their side when it comes to late term abortions.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1:09 p.m. ET, June 24, 2022Civil and reproductive rights groups criticize \"devastating\" SCOTUS decision on abortion rightsFrom CNN\u2019s Nicquel Terry Ellis, Chandelis Duster and Nicole Chavez\u00a0Dozens of civil and reproductive rights groups are denouncing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u00a0The National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda released a statement calling it a \u201cdevastating blow against women\u2019s civil and human rights.\u201d\u00a0\u201cEliminating abortion rights in many states will be an inconvenience for women and birthing people of means \u2014 mostly white \u2014 who will be able to afford the high cost of accessing safe abortion,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMany Black women and birthing people will lose all access \u2014 for them, the cost may be their health, lives or livelihood.\u201dThe NAACP also rejected the move by the Supreme Court with one leader saying it sets the country back to a \u201cdangerous era where basic constitutional rights only exist for a select few.\u201d\u201cThere is no denying the fact that this is a direct attack on all women, and Black women stand to be disproportionately impacted by the court\u2019s egregious assault on basic human rights,\u201d said NAACP General Counsel Janette McCarthy Wallace. \u201cWe must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure.\u201dLeaders from Movement for Black Lives say the decision further guts reproductive health care access for millions of Black women, girls, transgender and gender nonconforming people.\u00a0\u201cDobbs v. Jackson is another affront to Black lives in this country, with those in power continuously proving that they do not care about the health and well-being of Black people,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cAs a Black liberation movement guided by Black feminist values and a commitment to abolition, we see the fall of Roe for what it is: another avenue for the state to criminalize, surveil and harm the most vulnerable among us.\u201dThe Lilith Fund, which provides financial assistance and emotional support for people who need abortions in Texas, responded to the decision with a tweet saying \u201cAnother #SCOTUS day and we are struggling.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSending love and power to everyone who\u2019s had abortions, those seeking care right now, and to anyone who has been or will be denied the right to an abortion because of racist and classist laws,\u201d the tweet continues.Lupe M.

In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.Still, even before Friday\u2019s opinion, some red states were testing the waters around how fair they could reach to regulate outside their borders. A proposal in Missouri sought to apply the state\u2019s criminal abortion laws to abortions obtained in other states by its residents. The proposal would even extend to cases where \"sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.\"In Texas, some state lawmakers have vowed to punish companies that pay for the out of state travel of their employees who seek abortions. Medication abortion \u2014 and the way that women can order the two-pill regimen over the internet and be delivered it via the mail \u2014 is further complicating the legal questions around states efforts to eradicate the procedure. Blue states have proactively sought to protect their providers from extradition and other legal risks if red states try to prosecute them for facilitating an abortion.As the liberal justices see it, the questions over interstate abortion access is also shaping up to the next big court battle that Friday\u2019s ruling will prompt. They wrote that \u201cthe majority\u2019s ruling today invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts.\u201d\u201cCan a State bar women from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? Can a State prohibit advertising out-of-state abortions or helping women get to out-of-state providers? Can a State inter ere with the mailing of drugs used for medication abortions?\u201d they write. \u201cThe Constitution protects travel and speech and interstate commerce, so today\u2019s ruling will give rise to a host of new constitutional questions. Far from removing the Court from the abortion issue, the majority puts the Court at the center of the coming \u2018interjurisdictional abortion wars.\u2019\u201dshare with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:46 a.m. ET, June 24, 2022National Right to Life Convention erupted in cheers when ruling was announcedFrom CNN's Veronica StracqualursiAt the annual National Right to Life Convention in Atlanta, which is being held this weekend, cheers erupted when someone shouted \u201cRoe\u2019s been overturned!\u201d at 10:10 a.m. ET.Attendees hugged one another, and some were visibly emotional.\u201cWe are all excited,\u201d Carol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, told CNN. \u201cOf course, everybody here is erupting in tears of joy that this has finally happened.
