Patheos has the views of the prevalent religions and spiritualities of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDoes the Bible say that life begins at first breath? If so, that strengthens the pro-choice argument.\nTim Barnett from the Stand to Reason ministry uses his background as a teacher to grade the logic of arguments that attack his conservative Christian beliefs. His video series is called Red Pen Logic. Today\u2019s topic is, \u201cThe Bible Doesn\u2019t Say What He Thinks It Says.\u201d\nThe problem comes from actor and political commentator John Fugelsang, who attacked the popular Christian claim that life begins at conception with this tweet:\nWell don\u2019t tell God [that life begins at conception], bc the Bible says Life begins at First Breath.\nSorry, I didn\u2019t write it.\nFugelsang is probably referring to this verse from the Garden of Eden story: \u201cThen the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being\u201d (Genesis 2:7).\nThe importance of \u201cbreath\u201d\nBarnett responded that God breathed into Adam, and then Adam came to life. The \u201cbreath\u201d wasn\u2019t Adam\u2019s first breath, like a newborn\u2019s first breath would be. This is a unique situation and doesn\u2019t apply elsewhere.\nBut the Jewish interpretation disagrees, and this is critical since Jesus was a Jew. Breath is central to the Genesis idea of life. In the verse above, \u201cthe man became a living being,\u201d is literally translated as, \u201cthe man became a breathing creature.\u201d Breath is roughly synonymous with life.\nNot only does the Bible say that the \u201cbreath of life\u201d is what living things have, it\u2019s what they don\u2019t have when they die. This is what the dying animals during the Flood lost: \u201cEverything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died\u201d (Gen. 7:22). Another example is from the Canaanite genocide: \u201cBut as for the towns of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not let anything that breathes remain alive\u201d (Deuteronomy 20:16). One commentary says, \u201cBreath is understood to be essential to life; and that when the breathing stops, life ends.\u201d\nThe Christian case\nAnd now comes the obligatory dueling Bible quotes part of the argument. Barnett says that the Bible recognizes life before \u201cfirst breath\u201d and says, \u201cThe Bible consistently elevates the status of unborn humans to valuable individuals.\u201d\nHe cites two Bible passages. First, \u201cYou formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother\u2019s womb\u201d (Psalm 139:13). That sounds pretty bland, but Barnett interprets this to mean that we exist \u201cas ourselves\u201d before birth.\nI don\u2019t see it. First, \u201cknitted\u201d (Strong\u2019s #05526) is more literally \u201cwove,\u201d as would be done with a protective screen or fence woven from branches, and by implication it can mean to fence in, cover, or protect. Yes, it\u2019s important for a fetus to be in a protective womb when it is developing, but this simply acknowledges the gestation process. During that process, you aren\u2019t you, but (with luck) you will be by the end.\nRead that entire psalm. It\u2019s a worshipful acknowledgement of God\u2019s omniscience and power. Some variation on \u201cyou were you even at the beginning of the gestation process\u201d is not the message.\nBarnett\u2019s second Bible response is Luke 1:41\u201344 where John the Baptist (as a fetus in his mother Elizabeth) leapt for joy when he first came in contact with Jesus (as a younger fetus in Mary). He tells us, \u201cJesus and John were themselves long before first breath.\u201d\nWhat does that even mean? Yes, the process of gestation was underway. That\u2019s it. At that stage, they might have looked to the untrained eye indistinguishable from an elephant. \u201c[They] were themselves\u201d distills down to their DNA being in place and functioning, I guess\u2014pretty underwhelming.\nPassages on the other side of the question\nLet\u2019s return to the Bible for verses showing God\u2019s attitude toward life. Exodus 21:22\u20133 says that if a man injures a woman and causes a miscarriage, he is only fined. If instead he causes an injury to the woman, he is penalized \u201can eye for an eye.\u201d In other words, a fetus is less important than an adult.\nHere, though, experts differ on the best interpretation. Are we talking about a miscarriage (the fetus dies) or just a premature birth (it lives)? If the latter, just a fine might be reasonable. This passage doesn\u2019t help us much.\nAnother is the \u201ctrial of the bitter water\u201d in Numbers 5. Here, the issue is a husband who suspects his wife of adultery. The priest creates a potion for the wife to drink, with a curse if she\u2019s guilty. To be clear, the problem isn\u2019t \u201cMy wife is pregnant, and I want that fetus gone if it\u2019s not mine\u201d but rather \u201cI need to know if my wife has been unfaithful.\u201d (More here.)\nGod\u2019s judgment on the woman, if guilty, sounds like a prolapsed uterus. And if the woman were pregnant, that curse would likely cause a miscarriage. God clearly doesn\u2019t much care about a little collateral damage in the pursuit of justice. Maybe pro-lifers like Barrett should take the hint.\nThe hint gets far louder when you remember God\u2019s rampages. He drowned almost all the life on the planet, and he commanded genocide.\nHe even demanded human sacrifice. First, he created the law:\nConsecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal (Exodus 13:2).\nAnd later, he mocked Israel for it:\nSo I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live; I defiled them through their gifts\u2014the sacrifice of every firstborn\u2014that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am Jehovah (Ezekiel 20:25\u20136).\nAnd the Bible contains a scattering of killings to show that God doesn\u2019t place the lives of babies at the top of his list (see here and here).\nJewish sources on abortion\nThe Talmud is the source of religious law for rabbinic Judaism. It draws the rather common sense conclusion that the fetus, especially in its earliest days, has a very different moral value than a human child or adult: \u201cThe [Talmud] states that: \u2018the embryo is considered to be mere water until the fortieth day.\u2019 Afterwards, it is considered subhuman until it is born\u201d (source).\nAnother source says,\nUnlike in Catholicism, in Judaism the fetus isn\u2019t a legal person until it\u2019s born, so abortion can\u2019t be murder. (This isn\u2019t even as different from Catholicism as it seems. The Catholic Church itself didn\u2019t insist that life began at conception until 1869. Before that, the Church tolerated abortions through the 40th day of pregnancy.)\nAbout the abortion debate, one rabbi said,\nMost of the [Old Testament verses] that [conservative Christians are] bringing in for this are ridiculous. They\u2019re using my sacred text to justify taking away my rights in a way that is just so calculated and craven.\nWhen does life begin?\nThis is Barnett\u2019s final question, and here he turns to science rather than the Bible. He cited a book on embryology that said, \u201c[an embryo] is a human being from the time of fertilization.\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t help. It just raises the question, what is a \u201chuman being\u201d? If it\u2019s by definition a Homo sapiens life form from single fertilized egg cell until death, then sure. But quoting a definition is no argument.\nLet me respond with three points. First, the answer to \u201cWhen did life begin?\u201d is \u201cLife began on earth about 3.5 billion years ago.\u201d The egg and sperm are already alive, so when they join, the fertilized egg cell doesn\u2019t then become alive. What begins is the gestation process for a new offspring.\nNote how off-target the mindless celebration of \u201clife\u201d can be. Slugs and mosquitoes are alive, but pests don\u2019t have much inherent value. There\u2019s a range of value here, and we kill living things all the time. We\u2019re all on the same page about the value of a newborn. The problem is giving that single cell the value of a newborn right now, not nine months from now.\nA newborn is really complicated\nAnd finally, that brings us to the strangely appealing desire that sucks in many conservative Christians, the need to dismiss the changes that happen during the course of a human pregnancy. Comparing the two ends of that process, there are a few things that are the same. The single cell and the newborn are both alive, and they both have H. sapiens DNA. That\u2019s about it.\nBut there are some things that are radically different. The newborn has about one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) cells, each one differentiated and fitted with other cells in a precise arrangement. The single cell is\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 1 cell. The newborn has arms and legs, eyes and ears, a stomach and digestive system, brain and nervous system, heart and circulatory system, skin, liver, and on and on. The single cell doesn\u2019t have a single cell of any of this.\nIf you want to define \u201chuman being\u201d so that it includes both newborn and single cell, that\u2019s fine. But then you need to come up with some term that describes that gap. We have lots of words for subtle differences among young children\u2014newborn, baby, child, infant, toddler, and so on\u2014so surely we can find a word for the enormous change that happens from fertilization until birth. For example, I\u2019d say that a newborn is a person while the single cell isn\u2019t. If you object to the word \u201cperson,\u201d then suggest something better. We need a term like \u201cpersonhood\u201d to describe the enormous spectrum from single cell (not at all a person) to the newborn (100% person).\nBiblical arguments have no place in making laws in a country governed by a secular constitution like the United States. And even when we look in the Bible to see what it says, the pro-life argument is poorly supported.\nAbortion\u2014the issue that gets followers of Christ\nto vote against everything Christ talked about,\nby talking about something Christ never talked about.\n\u2014 @JohnFugelsang\n.\nImage from Kelly Sikkema (free-use license)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Previous Post\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nOctober 28, 2020\nChristianity Missed the Opportunity to Advance Civilization by 1500 Years\n\n\n\n\n\n Next Post\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 3, 2020\n\t\t\t\t\tCan a Moral Person Eat Meat?\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Our Archives\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a Category\nAbortion\nApologetics\nAtheism\nBible\nChristianity\nCosmology\nCreationism/ID\nDebate\nEvolution\nHistory\nHomosexuality\nHumor\nMorality\nOther Religions\nProphecy\nReligion\nScience\nSeparation of Church and State\nSkepticism\nSocial Issues\nUncategorized\nWords\n\n\n\n\nSelect a Month\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nSeptember 2021\nAugust 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nJuly 2019\nJune 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJuly 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nJanuary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJuly 2014\nJune 2014\nMay 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nFebruary 2014\nJanuary 2014\nDecember 2013\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nSeptember 2013\nAugust 2013\nJuly 2013\nJune 2013\nMay 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\nDecember 2012\nNovember 2012\nOctober 2012\nSeptember 2012\nAugust 2012\nJuly 2012\nJune 2012\nMay 2012\nApril 2012\nMarch 2012\nFebruary 2012\nJanuary 2012\nDecember 2011\nNovember 2011\nOctober 2011\nSeptember 2011\nAugust 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER RELATED CONTENT\n\t\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 20 Most Damning Bible Contradictions\n\n\nCross Examined\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nLauren Boebert And Marjorie Greene's Adult...\n\n\nLaughing in Disbelief\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nFACT CHECK: Melania Was A Sex...\n\n\nLaughing in Disbelief\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nIf There's a Yellow Deli in...\n\n\nNo Sacred Cows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks by This Author Books by Bob Seidensticker     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee All Titles \u00bb\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated posts from Cross Examined\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonreligious\n\n\nOne small Christian conclusion has sweeping political consequences\n\n\n\nCross Examined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonreligious\n\n\nWhy a Single Human Cell is Not a...\n\n\n\nCross Examined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonreligious\n\n\nMost U.S. Abortions are Due to Pro-Life Movement\n\n\n\nCross Examined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonreligious\n\n\n6 Flaws in the Pro-Life Position (that Pro-Lifers...\n\n\n\nCross Examined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRENDING AT  PATHEOS Nonreligious\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticism and Critiques\n\nIntroduction It's been a couple of weeks since I've blogged, but I...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Love\n\nIn the bustling whirlwind of our daily lives, where the cacophony of...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Make Remote Work Effective, Think About Others\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced many companies to rapidly transition to remote work....\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility Is Key to Solving Problems of Tomorrow\n\nThe world of work is undergoing a dramatic transformation.
