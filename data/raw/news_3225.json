Wade, causing analysts to warn of a rising threat of violence. Eight abortion-related demonstrations featured armed individuals in the week after the June 24 ruling, bringing the total number of such protests in 2022 to 10\u2014nearly twice as many as in all of 2021, according to a new analysis shared with TIME by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a nonprofit that tracks political violence and demonstrations.Anti-government militias and extremist groups like the Proud Boys have appeared at 27 abortion-related events as of July 1, according to ACLED\u2019s data, a 160% spike over the previous year. In 2020, far-right groups appeared at only 1% of demonstrations related to abortion rights; so far this year, almost one in five events involved members of a far-right group. As armed demonstrators and far-right groups flock to abortion-related protests, abortion-rights activists have begun bringing guns themselves, according to ACLED, including at a rally in Dallas on July 2. The combination of the presence of firearms and competing demonstrators has alarmed analysts. Roughly half of the abortion-related demonstrations that have turned violent or destructive have involved counter-protestors. \u201cIt\u2019s all the makings of a really worrying trend,\u201d says  Roudabeh Kishi, the director of research and innovation at ACLED. Abortion-related demonstrations that involve people with firearms are more likely to turn violent. So far this year, 33% of them have, according to ACLED\u2019s data, compared to 0.2% of those that don\u2019t involve guns. None of that violence has included shootings. But tensions are rising, giving domestic extremists an opportunity to exploit these protests to incite violence among their supporters, national security officials say.A member of the Proud Boys stands between a group of anti-abortion people attending a celebration and a group of protestors demanding the right to abortion outside of the Idaho Statehouse in Boise, Idaho on June 28, 2022.Sarah A. Miller\u2014Idaho Statesman/APOutside the Idaho state capitol on June 28, fighting broke out between an anti-abortion prayer rally of 200 people\u2014which included a number of Proud Boys armed with assault rifles\u2014and protestors demonstrating against the Supreme Court decision. A few days earlier, on the evening of the ruling, a self-identified member of the Three Percenters militia armed with an AR-15 started recording a group of protestors outside a crisis pregnancy center in Eugene, Ore. The protest was dispersed after police fired tear gas, leading to the arrest of 10 people.Read More: Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Centers Are Collecting Troves of Data That Could Be Weaponized Against Women.The Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the potential for violence by domestic extremists in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. Viral posts on online forums warned that the far-left abortion-rights group \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge,\u201d which DHS calls \u201ca network of loosely affiliated suspected violent extremists\u201d linked to arsons at crisis pregnancy centers, had shared a blog post encouraging a \u201cNight of Rage\u201d after the abortion ruling was issued. In response, far-right extremists called for \u201cattacks against abortion-related targets,\u201d according to a DHS intelligence memo disseminated to federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, first responders and their private sector partners. While widespread violence failed to materialize, the dueling militant rallying cries highlighted the increasingly chaotic environment, in which both real and perceived threats are blending with disinformation, leading to a feedback loop that can be as dangerous as the threats themselves, security officials and analysts say.\u201cPeople are taking threats from more obscure, fringe groups and spreading them widely online: \u2018Oh, look, here\u2019s what they want to do to us,\u2019\u201d says Sivanne Shalev, the head of emerging trends and misinformation at ActiveFence, a technology security company that analyzes disinformation and hate speech. \u201cAmplifying threats and misinformation [causes] a lot of confusion which in itself can be dangerous and can promote real world harm.\u201dAbortion-rights activists say the uptick in violent threats and attacks they\u2019ve seen in recent years is tied to the larger rise in hate speech and political violence. Many of the same groups involved in the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 events are now threatening abortion providers, says Melissa Fowler, chief program officer at the National Abortion Federation (NAF). \u201cFor abortion providers, watching January 6 was really very familiar,\u201d says Fowler. \u201cPeople with militia gear, with weapons, the rhetoric like calling for people to be hung and to be harmed\u2026those are all things that that these extremists do outside of clinics and have been using to torment providers for years.\u201dArmed militia members guard the route of abortion rights demonstrators\u2019 march in downtown Denton Texas, on June 28, 2022.Shelby Tauber\u2014ReutersViolence against abortion providers rose significantly in 2021, according to a report last month from NAF, which has been tracking this data for 45 years. Assaults of abortion-clinic employees and patients increased 128% year-over-year, while stalking leaped 600% and bomb threats jumped 80%. When Texas passed a law last year significantly restricting access to abortion, there was an escalation of violent and aggressive activity there and in surrounding states where women sought care, Fowler says, such as harassment, intimidation, forcibly entering abortion clinics, and death threats. Abortion-rights activists fear a similar surge with even greater intensity in the aftermath of the Dobbs ruling. \u201cA political victory like this can really embolden people who want to harass and terrorize abortion providers,\u201d Fowler says.Read more: Inside the Biden Administration\u2019s Uphill Battle Against Far-Right Extremism.In the days since the ruling, posts in extremist online spaces have lauded violent anti-abortion activists like Robert Lewis Dear, who killed three people and wounded nine others in 2015 in a mass shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic. One poster, citing Dear, wrote, \u201cIf you\u2019re \u2018pro-life\u2019 but aren\u2019t prepared to follow in their footsteps\u2026you\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d according to the internal DHS memo, first reported by Axios.The memo warns that federal judges, state lawmakers, abortion clinics and abortion rights protests, as well as faith-based anti-abortion centers, could all be targeted. \u201cSome racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists\u2019 embrace of pro-life narratives may be linked to the perception of wanting to \u2018save white children\u2019 and \u2018fight white genocide,'\u201d it says. \u201cViolence could occur for weeks\u2026 particularly as [domestic extremists] may be mobilized to respond to changes in state laws and ballot measures on abortion stemming from the decision.\u201dAt the same time, the FBI is investigating a spate of threats and arson targeting anti-abortion pregnancy centers that began in the weeks after the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion indicating that Roe would be overturned. The June 24 DHS memo also cites at least 11 incidents of vandalism \u201cthreatening violence targeting religious facilities perceived as being opposed to abortion.\u201dAnti-abortion groups say they\u2019ve stepped up security amid rising tensions. Students for Life, a national anti-abortion organization, has been adding safety trainings for its staff as well as \u201cmore and more paid security,\u201d spokesperson Kristi Hamrick says. Heartbeat International, a national organization that runs more than 2,500 anti-abortion centers, told TIME the week before the ruling that \u201cthe primary concern we have from affiliates is regarding their centers\u2019 security and protection given the increase of attacks directed at pro-life organizations.\u201dWith abortion-related protests set to continue in the months leading up to the midterm elections, federal law-enforcement officials acknowledge they\u2019ll have to walk the line between monitoring these often amorphous threats and protecting peaceful protests. As DHS itself notes itself in its memo, \u201cstrong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute domestic violent extremism or illegal activity and is constitutionally protected.\u201dWith reporting by Abigail Abrams/WashingtonMore Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
