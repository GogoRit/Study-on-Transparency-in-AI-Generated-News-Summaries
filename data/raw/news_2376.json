Pierce\u00a0\u00a0| Jan. 25, 2020, 11:16 p.m. | Updated: Jan. 26, 2020, 4:51 a.m.(Rick Egan  |  The Salt Lake Tribune)     Hundreds of marchers walk around the  Utah State Capitol, in the March for Life Utah 2020, Saturday, Jan. 25, 2020.<>After the morning fog lifted, hundreds of protesters marched around the Utah Capitol on Saturday afternoon with a clear message: End legal abortion in the United States.Organizers of the March for Life event wanted to draw attention to the \u201capproximately 3,000 Utah babies\u201d who \u201close their lives through abortion\u201d every year and the \u201cmillions of lives that have been lost since the passage of Roe v. Wade,\u201d according to march organizers.The march was set to roughly coincide with the anniversary of that landmark ruling by the Supreme Court, which was handed down on Jan. 22, 1973. It struck down many state and federal anti-abortion laws, declaring that women have a right to end their pregnancies without excessive government restriction.The Salt Lake City event began with a prayer by Bishop Oscar A. Solis, who leads Utah\u2019s 300,000-plus Catholics, and featured remarks from Deanna Holland, vice president of Pro-Life Utah, and anti-abortion activist Dusty Johns. State Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, announced plans to introduce a bill that would end elective abortions in Utah.After those remarks, marchers circled the Capitol, carrying signs proclaiming, \u201cDefend life,\u201d \u201cChoose the gift of life,\u201d \u201cBabies are murdered here\u201d and \u201cAll lives matter, even the unborn, in the eyes of God.\u201dThe event was held in conjunction with other marches around the country this weekend. On Friday, Donald Trump became the first sitting president to address the March for Life in the nation\u2019s capital, telling thousands on the National Mall they were motivated to be there by \u201cpure, unselfish love\u201d and declaring, \u201cUnborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\u201dPrevious anti-abortion presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, invited march leaders to the White House, sent messages or delivered messages over the phone but did not attend.spierce@sltrib.comFollow @ScottDPierceDonate to the newsroom now.
