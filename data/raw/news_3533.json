An incident involving a crackdown on a pro-choice protest at Loyola University New Orleans, a Catholic and Jesuit institution, raised FIRE\u2019s hackles given the university\u2019s fairly strong promises of free expression and administrators\u2019 changing story.\nLoyola\u2019s student newspaper, The Maroon, reported on a situation in which student Elena Voisin was handing out flyers on campus to promote a pro-choice march organized by the Louisiana Abortion Rights Action Committee. Ken Weber, Loyola\u2019s associate director of student life, ordered Voisin to stop handing out the flyers because they conflict with the university\u2019s Jesuit values.\nVoisin complied, but continued to verbally promote the march, at which point two police officers ordered Voisin to stop. According to a second administrator quoted by the paper, the police were called in response to Voisin being loud and causing a disturbance. But afterward, a third administrator told The Maroon the flyers could not be distributed because they violated the school\u2019s solicitation policy, which required the flyers to be pre-approved by the university.\n\nIf administrators ended Voisin\u2019s demonstration because it was not in line with the school\u2019s values, that is viewpoint discrimination.\n\nFIRE wrote Loyola on Nov. 7 to request more information about this incident and to urge the university to narrow the solicitation policy and bring its other policies into agreement with one another. The university responded by saying it acted in accordance with its policies, but offered no further details.\nThis is troubling, because the details we already know paint a different picture.\u00a0\nLoyola\u2019s promises of free expression include the right to dissent. University policy reads: \u201cFreedom of speech and freedom of assembly are encouraged and supported at Loyola University New Orleans. Implicit in these freedoms and with regard for the common purposes of the institution is the right to dissent and demonstrate in a peaceful and non-disruptive manner.\u201d\nFurther, elsewhere in university policy, Loyola states that debate and other forms of expression are permitted on campus \u201cregardless of the content or viewpoints expressed\u201d so long as they are nondisruptive and \u201care consistent with the mission and goals of the University.\u201d\u00a0\nThese policies, read alongside each other, directly conflict, or at the very least are confusing to students, and can produce situations exactly like this one. On one hand, students have the right to dissent, but on the other, that dissent . . . needs to be in line with the university\u2019s mission. Yet dissent, by definition, involves disagreement with authority or the popular consensus.\u00a0\nFIRE has written before about how contradictory policies like these chill student speech by creating \u201ca false dichotomy that students must forgo certain interests in civil discourse and speculative conversation should they wish to pursue an education within a religious context.\u201d\u00a0\nPrivate institutions, especially religious ones, sometimes prioritize other values over free speech \u2014 often causing FIRE to label them \u201cWarning schools.\u201d Unlike a traditional Warning school which explicitly places some values above freedom of expression, Loyola tries to have it both ways, both promising free expression to its students in one policy, and contradicting that promise in another.\u00a0\n\nEven if Loyola was merely enforcing its solicitation policy, that doesn\u2019t resolve our concerns about the state of free speech at the university.\n\nLoyola is not unique in making promises of free expression that include the right to dissent, as long as that dissent is in line with the university\u2019s religious mission, but such contradictions send confusing messages and produce chilling effects on student speech \u2014 as aptly demonstrated here.\nPolicies aside, another wrinkle in the situation is the university\u2019s apparent shift in rationale after the incident, when an administrator invoked the solicitation policy to explain why Voisin could not hand out the flyers. (If that is the case, the university has some questions to answer for changing its story.)\u00a0\nEven if Loyola was merely enforcing its solicitation policy, that doesn\u2019t resolve our concerns about the state of free speech at the university. According to Loyola\u2019s policies in the Student Organization Handbook, solicitation is \u201cany activity that seeks to make contact with students, faculty and/or staff to collect information, sell items, or gain support.\u201d This definition applies to a wide range of activities, including \u201cadvertising, selling, petitioning, campaigning, distributing flyers, product orientation, and surveying residents by telephone, mail, e-mail, or in person.\u201d Under this policy, student groups must get approval from the administration in order to engage in a broad range of expressive activities.\u00a0\nIt also means the university should seriously reflect on its solicitation policy \u2014 because it\u2019s ripe for abuse. As we wrote in the letter:\n\nThe [solicitation] policy gives Loyola a loophole to control a broad range of student speech on campus by labeling it \u201csolicitation.\u201d In requiring on-campus student groups to submit such a wide range of expressive activities for pre-approval \u2014 even attempts to simply \u201cgain support\u201d or petition for a cause \u2014 Loyola erects against a wide array of students\u2019 expressive conduct a significant prior restraint \u2014 which are \u201cthe most serious and least tolerable infringement\u201d of free speech. This is so for a number of reasons, not the least of these is that they prevent students from engaging in spontaneous expression, which is required to, for example, respond to newsworthy events, or stage counterprotests, while the events remain in the public\u2019s attention.\n\nIf administrators ended Voisin\u2019s demonstration because it was not in line with the school\u2019s values, that is viewpoint discrimination, and in violation of the school\u2019s promise that students enjoy the right to dissent. If, instead, administrators ended the demonstration because of the solicitation policy, then that policy must be narrowed, as it risks implicating protected expression. Either way, the university\u2019s shifting rationale chilled speech, and its involvement of police officers to stop Voisin from verbally promoting the event is even more concerning.\nLoyola\u2019s stonewalling in response to FIRE\u2019s letter is equally disappointing. The university apparently cannot decide why it shut down Voisin\u2019s demonstration, and its stated reasons run contrary to its strong \u2014 albeit qualified \u2014 free speech promises. Whatever its reasons, student expression, even at private, religious universities, still matters, and Loyola administrators did not act above board by changing their story after the incident. This shifting rationale, combined with the university\u2019s evasive response to our inquiries, is inexcusable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue Process\nFree Speech\nStudent Rights\nLoyola University New Orleans\nLoyola University New Orleans: Student Prevented From Promoting Pro-Choice March\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Recent Articles\n      \n\n\nFIRE\u2019s award-winning Newsdesk covers the free speech news you need to stay informed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                West Texas A&M President cancels student charity drag show for second time\n               \n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n                  West Texas A&M President Wendler enforced his unconstitutional prior restraint by canceling a student-organized charity drag show for the second time. \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Supreme Court considers when government \u2018persuasion\u2019 becomes unconstitutional coercion\n               \n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n                  In today\u2019s oral argument for NRA v.
