Wade in June, all eyes will turn to Kansas, where voters will decide whether to allow the state legislature to restrict abortion.\n\u00a0On Aug. 2, about five weeks after the nation\u2019s highest federal court is expected to issue its decision, the so-called \u201cValue Them Both\u201d constitutional amendment goes to a statewide referendum. It may be the first test of where voters are on abortion in a post-Roe world.\n\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re being targeted by pro-abortion groups already. They understand that Kansas is going to be the first of the dominoes to either stand or fall. And it\u2019s going to be a knockdown, drag-out,\u201d said Chuck Weber, executive director of the Kansas Catholic Conference, which represents the four bishops of Kansas in political matters.\n\u00a0The proposed amendment wouldn\u2019t make any abortions illegal. Instead, it would add language to the Kansas Constitution stating that \u201cthe state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion.\u201d That would allow the state legislature to restrict or prohibit abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The Kansas Constitution does not currently mention abortion. But in April 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court found that the state\u2019s constitution protects abortion as a \u201cfundamental right\u201d of \u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d inherent in the constitution\u2019s declaration that \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d are \u201cinalienable natural rights.\u201d As abortion is, according to the court, a fundamental right, any laws that seek to restrict it are subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d and are \u201cpresumed unconstitutional.\u201d\n\u00a0The case, Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt, which was brought by a father-and-daughter team of doctors who perform abortions, challenged a state ban on dilation-and-extraction abortions, which some call dismemberment abortions. Pro-life advocates say the court decision overturning the law either nullified or at least undermined 23 statutes restricting abortion that the Kansas Legislature has passed since 1997.\n\u00a0While Kansas is a right-leaning state that usually (though not always) votes Republican, the state\u2019s highest court is generally left of center, in part because of the outsize role the state\u2019s board of bar overseers plays in nominating justices to the court. Lawyers elect five of the nine members of the nominating commission that presents to the governor three finalists for each state supreme court opening.\u00a0\n\u00a0In addition, three of the five most recent governors of the state have been supporters of legal abortion, including its current Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The court\u2019s decision made Kansas what some call a haven for abortion in the generally pro-life heartland \u2014 particularly when the governors of Texas and Oklahoma briefly banned abortions as unnecessary elective surgeries during the height of the coronavirus restrictions in the spring of 2020. If voters approve the amendment, it will flip the court\u2019s decision and allow pro-life statutes to take effect.\n\u00a0\u201cThis vote is critical for the pro-life movement in Kansas, critical for the protection of women and preborn babies in Kansas,\u201d said Danielle Underwood, director of communications of Kansans for Life. \u201cWe know that the abortion industry wants two things for sure: They want to keep Kansas a sanctuary state for abortion. And they want to prevent any restrictions on abortion. And that\u2019s frightening for the women and babies of Kansas.\u201d\n\u00a0Weber said three pro-life organizations in the state \u2014 the Kansas Catholic Conference, Kansans for Life, and Kansas Family Voice \u2014 have made common cause over the proposed constitutional amendment. He also said he has gotten support from the state council of the Knights of Columbus.\n\u00a0Weber expects pro-lifers will get outspent at least 3 to 1, which means opponents of the amendment will likely dominate the airwaves in the weeks leading up to the vote. Getting the word out to Catholic and evangelical Protestant churches is essential, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cOur most recent polling indicates that while Kansas is pro-life, there\u2019s a big segment of the voting population that\u2019s unsure and unclear about the amendment,\u201d Weber said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to get out there and work harder than everyone else, to explain what\u2019s going on and why this is important.\u201d\n\nOther States\nConstitutional amendments making it clear that the state constitution does not guarantee a right to abortion have already passed in Arkansas (1988), Tennessee (2014), West Virginia (2018), and Louisiana (2020).\n\u00a0In November 2022, a similar state constitutional amendment is set to go before voters in Kentucky.\n\u00a0\u201cWe have laws that prohibit abortion after 20 weeks in all but the most limited circumstances in Kentucky. We have excellent informed-consent and ultrasound requirements. Making sure that the state constitution is not used to strike those down is our No. 1 priority at the moment,\u201d said Jason Hall, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky.\u00a0\n\u00a0Other states also have generally pro-life legislatures and either pro-legal-abortion or questionable state courts. Oklahoma, for instance, has a majority of solidly pro-life legislators and electorate. But the state\u2019s courts are less reliable on that subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Three finalists for each opening on the Oklahoma Supreme Court are selected by a 15-member nominating commission, six of whom are elected by lawyers in the state.\n\u00a0Pro-lifers are interested in bringing measures before the state\u2019s voters to jettison the judicial nominating commission and replace it with a federal-style system, in which the chief executive nominates and another branch of government confirms. They also want to see a pro-life amendment added to the state constitution.\n\u00a0\u201cKansas will be a good test for us. It\u2019s going to be a good leading indicator for what we think is possible,\u201d said Brett Farley, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Oklahoma, which represents the Catholic bishops of the state.\n\n\u2018A Top Priority\u2019\nIn April 2017 the Iowa Legislature passed bills requiring a 72-hour waiting period to get an abortion and banning abortion after 20 weeks. The Iowa Supreme Court in June 2018 found on a 5-2 vote that a state right to abortion, though not mentioned in the Iowa Constitution, is \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u201d and is therefore a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d\nPro-lifers in Iowa are in the middle of trying to get a statewide referendum on a state constitutional amendment that would flip the state court ruling. The Iowa Legislature approved the amendment in May 2019; if it does so again in 2023 or 2024, then the amendment would go to the voters in November 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout it, pro-life statutes in Iowa are all but useless.\n\u201cSo the problem is, even if Roe v. Wade goes down, at the state level we still have a right to abortion here that makes it very difficult to even regulate abortion,\u201d said Tom Chapman, executive director of the Iowa Catholic Conference. \u201cSo this is really a top priority for us.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \npro-life amendments\nkansas\nmatt mcdonald\nroe v. wade\nabortion\n\n\n\n\nMatthew McDonald Matthew McDonald is a staff reporter for The National Catholic Register and the editor of New Boston Post.
