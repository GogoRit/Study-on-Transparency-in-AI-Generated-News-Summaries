Wade and another ruling. Therefore, he wrote, the measure did not become law when it was enacted and could not be law even after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that precedent last year.His ruling came in a lawsuit filed by American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of Georgia doctors and advocacy groups that challenged the law. \n\nDuring oral arguments Tuesday before the Georgia Supreme Court on the state of Georgia\u2019s appeal challenging the lower court ruling, state solicitor-general Stephen Petrany noted that the U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that Roe v. Wade was an incorrect interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan seeks clemency to avoid what could be Georgia\u2019s first execution in more than 4 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump seeks to appeal decision not to disqualify district attorney from Georgia election case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan will not run with No Labels as it seeks a 2024 candidate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Georgia abortion law \u201cwould be valid if enacted today under the exact same federal Constitution, it was valid when it was enacted,\u201d he argued.Even if the state high court doesn\u2019t agree with that, Petrany argued, the U.S. Supreme Court has made very clear \u201cthat its decisions must apply retroactively, that lower courts and state courts cannot simply decline to apply its decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia Stone, a lawyer for the doctors and advocacy groups, asserted that the lower court judge got it right, that the Georgia Constitution says a law can never be valid if it is unconstitutional at the time that it is passed. The Georgia high court has repeatedly said that the General Assembly \u201cis presumed to know the law, including judicial interpretations of that law,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case where there was gray area in this in 2019,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThis was a case where there were 50 years of Supreme Court precedent.\u201dThe Georgia high court justices asked the lawyers for each side technical questions about their own arguments and those put forth by the other side.Georgia\u2019s abortion measure was signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 and took effect in July after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It prohibits most abortions once there is a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat.\u201d Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound around six weeks into a pregnancy in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart. That means the law effectively bans most abortions in Georgia at a point before many people know they are pregnant.The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother\u2019s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney in November ruled that the Georgia abortion law was invalid because when it was signed into law, U.S. Supreme Court precedent allowed abortions well beyond six weeks.\n\nHis ruling immediately halted enforcement of the law statewide and allowed abortions to resume past the cutoff point established in the law. But the Georgia Supreme Court granted a request from the state to put McBurney\u2019s ruling on hold while its appeal moved forward, again halting most abortions after about six weeks into a pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
