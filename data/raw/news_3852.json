It was put forward by President Alberto Fernandez, who adopted much of the language and ideas championed by the feminist movement for 15 years.\nFernandez promised in his 2019 election campaign to legalise abortion, and unveiled his bill to do so in March. The pandemic delayed the initiative until now. It is the first time a president in Argentina has endorsed the legalisation of abortion. But the outcome in the more conservative Senate, which began debating the legislation on Tuesday, is too close to call.\nHistoric vote\nIn 2018, the Senate rejected a similar bill following a dramatic debate that altered public discourse on a topic long considered taboo. Now the green scarf that symbolises the legalisation movement in Argentina is held up as a banner of women\u2019s rights across the continent.\nThousands of pro-choice women are planning to camp out in front of the National Congress in anticipation of the Senate results. A smaller group of opponents is expected to show its discontent on Tuesday. The groups will be separated by fencing.\nIf Argentina legalises abortion, it would be the largest country in the region to do so \u2013 only Uruguay, Cuba, Guyana, along with Mexico City and the state of Oaxaca, have legalised elective abortion.\nAn abortion-rights activists in favour of an abortion bill going through Congress, smokes outside the legislative building during a demonstration in Buenos Aires [File: Victor R Caivano/AP Photo]\nAbortion is illegal in Argentina except in instances of rape or if the mother\u2019s life or health is at risk \u2013 but even that law is not universally applied, and there are conservative parts of the country where women are denied the service by doctors who express a moral or religious objection to it, or who avoid providing it out of fear of prosecution.\nBoth doctors and women who abort face up to 15 years in jail under a criminal code written in 1921.\nThe illegality has not stopped abortions: Argentine officials estimate that between 370,000 and 522,000 pregnancies are terminated every year, the vast majority in secret. Those with money pay for safer abortions, those without face dangerous consequences. Some 38,000 women end up in hospitals with complications due to clandestine abortions, officials say, and since 1983, at least 3,000 women have died as a result.\n\u2018The desperation\u2019\nPamela Sires, 32, saw the risky, clandestine world up close. She first considered having an abortion at 16, but decided against it when she saw the harrowing experience of her mother\u2019s friend, who had purchased pills from a woman in their low income neighbourhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, and required emergency help. She saw her sister have a similar experience.\nSo, when Sires became pregnant a few years later, she turned to a clandestine clinic that performed the surgical procedure. It took her weeks to raise the money to pay for it \u2013 which was 5,000 pesos (about $60) and represented a large sum for her at the time.\n\u201cIt was horrible because the desperation, the anguish, the fear you have going to a place like that,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to come out of there alive,\u201d\nAlanis said there are many hospitals in which, when a woman arrives with a hemorrhage, the first thing they ask her is: \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cThey are constantly penalising her. We need a law that is clear. A law that lets doctors know what their obligations are, and let\u2019s women know what their rights are and until when,\u201d said Alanis, a founder of the Argentine chapter of Catholics for the Right to Decide.\n \n\n\n\n \nThe Catholic Church and its head Pope Francis, who is from Argentina, are among the key voices in opposition. Lawmakers against legalisation centre their arguments around the concept of defending \u201cboth lives\u201d and say there are limits to what a woman should have the right to decide.\n\u201cI am in favour of life in absolute terms,\u201d said Natalia Villa, a legislator, during the debate in the House of Deputies. She called the abortion debate \u201copportunistic\u201d and a \u201csmoke screen to cover a country that is falling to pieces\u201d in the midst of a pandemic.\nNotion of citizenry\n\u201cThe society already debated this two years ago and it was rejected,\u201d said Ana Belen Marmora, a lawyer and spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Frente Joven, or Young Front. She accused the government of turning a blind eye and covering up the country\u2019s immense public health needs that have only become greater this year.\n\u201cWanting to approve something just because it happens is arbitrary and reflects a state that is not taking responsibility for the causes,\u201d she said.\nShe pointed to a public opinion poll by firm Giacobbe & Associates that found that 60 percent of Argentines are against legalising abortion.\nAnother poll, by consultancy Poliarquia, found 48 percent opposition, while the Centro Estrategico Latinoamericano de Geopolitica found that 54 percent of Argentines favour legalising abortion in all circumstances.\nA woman in favour of legalising abortion watches the debate on an abortion bill at the National Congress in Buenos Aires [File: Agustin Marcarian/Reuters]\nGiselle Carino, executive director of the New York-based International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region, said the impact of legalisation in Argentina would be enormous for the region, at a time when conditions are ripe for change elsewhere.\nA court case is seeking to make abortion legal in Brazil, Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court is considering a case seeking to strip abortion from the country\u2019s criminal code, and Chile is in the midst of rewriting its constitution.\nThe Argentine debate has included many of the same concepts that are core to the debate in other countries around public health, how illegality leads to death and that it particularly affects vulnerable women.\n\u201cWhat I see that is different in the movement here is this notion of citizenry,\u201d said Carino, an Argentine. \u201cThe idea that women are not full citizens without access to legal and safe abortion. And without full citizenry, democracy is not possible.\u201d\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
