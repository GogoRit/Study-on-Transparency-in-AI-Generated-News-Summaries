(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron on Monday said he would sign legislation allowing exceptions to Kentucky\u2019s near-total abortion ban in cases of rape and incest \u2014 signaling a departure from his past comments on the law.\u00a0\nCameron, Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, said in an\u00a0 interview on the Tony & Dwight show on NewsRadio 840 WHAS that he would sign legislation that provided exceptions in cases of rape and incest if the General Assembly approved\u00a0 it.\u00a0\n\u201cIf our legislature was to bring legislation before me that provided exceptions for rape and incest, I would sign that legislation,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first time Cameron has publicly expressed support for changing the Kentucky abortion ban by adding any exceptions.\nDuring a Republican primary debate held in Louisville earlier this year, Cameron was among candidates who signaled support for Kentucky\u2019s current law, which bans abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy. His office has also defended the law in court.\u00a0\nThe Kentucky attorney general\u2019s website says: \u201cGeneral Cameron is a fearless advocate for the unborn because every life is worth protecting. Inside the courtroom and outside of it, Daniel Cameron is the tip of the spear in the fight to preserve a pro-life Kentucky.\u201d\nThe trigger law, also called the Human Life Protection Act, went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. The law makes no exception for pregnancies resulting from rape, incest or in cases of serious fetal abnormality. It does require doctors to \u201cmake reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve both the life of the mother and the life of the unborn child \u2018in a manner consistent with reasonable practice,\u2019\u201d a 2022 advisory opinion from the Cameron\u2019s office said.\nLast November Kentucky voters defeated an anti-abortion constitutional amendment.\u00a0\nWhen asked for clarification of Cameron\u2019s latest comments and if he continued to support the law as it is, his campaign provided a statement calling Cameron \u201cthe pro-life candidate\u201d in the race and saying that he \u201csupports the Human Life Protection Act.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut if the situation in Kentucky were to change and the legislature brought him a bill to add exceptions for rape and incest, he would, of course, sign it,\u201d the statement said.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Cameron campaign called Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear \u201can extremist\u201d on abortion but\u00a0 did not indicate if Cameron would urge Republican lawmakers to add exceptions.\nA spokesperson for the Beshear campaign, Alex Floyd, issued this statement: \u201cThroughout his time in office, even before this campaign began, Daniel Cameron has made it clear that he supports Kentucky\u2019s extreme abortion ban with no exceptions for survivors of rape or incest. He has repeated that position in public statements, questionnaires, press interviews, and debates. As attorney general, Cameron repeatedly defended this extreme law with its lack of exceptions in front of multiple courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court. Either recent polling numbers have changed Cameron\u2019s core beliefs, or he is lying to Kentuckians now that he is seven weeks from an election.\u201d\nAlso on the radio show, Cameron pushed back at an attack ad from Beshear\u2019s campaign, criticizing Cameron\u2019s stance on abortion. The ad, released two weeks ago, features a Jefferson County prosecutor who claims that Cameron believes nine-year-old rape victims \u201cshould be forced to give birth.\u201d\u00a0\nNine was the age of the two youngest abortion recipients in Kentucky in 2021 and last year before the procedure was all but outlawed, Deborah Yetter reported, based on state records. In 2021 in Kentucky, 34 girls ages 15 or younger received abortions,\u00a0\nCameron chalked the Beshear ad up to a \u201csmear campaign,\u201d but reiterated that he supports \u201ca culture of life.\u201d\u00a0\nBeshear has said Kentucky\u2019s abortion ban should be amended to include expections for rape and incest. In a December interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he said the Republican-dominated General Assembly had \u201cgiven rapists more rights than their victims.\u201d\u00a0\nRepublican House Whip Jason Nemes proposed a bill in the last legislative session that would allow exceptions in case of rape and incest but the bill did not advance at all.\u00a0\n\u201cEither recent polling numbers have changed Cameron\u2019s core beliefs, or he is lying to Kentuckians now that he is seven weeks from an election,\u201d a spokesperson for the Beshear campaign said in a statement about Cameron\u2019s Monday comments.\nThe WHAS interview also touched on another area that has brought on social media criticism of Cameron \u2014 whether or not he wants to ban birth control and other contraceptives. Cameron said on the radio he supports birth control and contraception and wrote off the idea of him not supporting either as \u201ccompletely absurd.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, in response to a questionnaire from anti-abortion group Northern Kentucky Right to Life earlier this year, Cameron\u2019s campaign responded \u201cyes\u201d to all questions including the following: \u201cWill you actively support (and if in a position to do so, sponsor and vote for) legislation which prohibits all use of local, state, federal, and/or Medicare or Medicaid funds for abortion (including chemical abortions, such as RU-486, or the so-called \u201cmorning after pill,\u201d Norplant, Depo Provera, or the so-called \u201cstandard birth control pill\u201d)?\u201d\nCameron\u2019s campaign also responded yes to another question regarding funding birth control: \u201cIf there should come before you the question of appointment or confirmation of an individual to any board, agency, or committee, etc., which does or could perform, counsel, refer, or fund abortion (including chemical abortions, such as RU-486, and the so-called \u201cmorning after pill,\u201d Norplant, Depo Provera, and the so-called \u201cstandard birth control pill\u201d), will you nominate or confirm only individuals (1) who refuse to perform, counsel, refer, or fund any surgical or chemical abortion and (2) who refuse to support, vote for, or fund any government or private agency that would perform, counsel, refer, or fund any surgical or chemical abortion?\u201d\nThis story has been updated with a response from the Beshear campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXCameron now says he would sign rape, incest exceptions to Kentucky\u2019s abortion ban\nby McKenna Horsley, Kentucky Lantern September 18, 2023\nCameron now says he would sign rape, incest exceptions to Kentucky\u2019s abortion ban\nby McKenna Horsley, Kentucky Lantern September 18, 2023\n Republican gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron on Monday said he would sign legislation allowing exceptions to Kentucky\u2019s near-total abortion ban in cases of rape and incest \u2014 signaling a departure from his past comments on the law.\u00a0\nCameron, Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, said in an\u00a0 interview on the Tony & Dwight show on NewsRadio 840 WHAS that he would sign legislation that provided exceptions in cases of rape and incest if the General Assembly approved\u00a0 it.\u00a0\n\u201cIf our legislature was to bring legislation before me that provided exceptions for rape and incest, I would sign that legislation,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first time Cameron has publicly expressed support for changing the Kentucky abortion ban by adding any exceptions.\nDuring a Republican primary debate held in Louisville earlier this year, Cameron was among candidates who signaled support for Kentucky\u2019s current law, which bans abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy.
