Wade, the attorneys general write, \u201ccharities that support pregnant mothers in need have been firebombed and pro-life organizations have been attacked almost daily and terrorized.\u201d\nAlthough the attacks began last month, it was only last week that the FBI announced that it would investigate them.\nNoting that the federal government\u2019s duty to protect its citizens against violence \u201cdoes not turn on the victim\u2019s identity\u201d and that \u201caccess to justice cannot turn on partisan affiliation,\u201d the letter calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously investigate and prosecute these illegal acts.\n\u201cAmericans shouldn\u2019t fear for their lives for speaking up for what they believe in,\u201d AG Yost said. \u201cThe First Amendment provides the right to speak freely, regardless of the topic and without fear of having your home, workplace or, worse, your life threatened.\u201d\nThe letter urges the Department of Justice to begin its investigations with Jane\u2019s Revenge, a pro-choice group that has declared \u201copen season\u201d on anti-abortion organizations, urging its members \u201cto paint, to burn, to cut, (and) to jam\u201d pro-life centers and advocates. Jane\u2019s Revenge has claimed responsibility for attacks in Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.\n\u201cThe FBI has more than enough resources to determine the organization\u2019s members and to track down those carrying out these acts of violence, which qualify as terrorism under federal law,\u201d the attorneys general write.\nYost and his colleagues even offer state assistance with the investigations.\nDifferences of opinion are healthy, AG Yost noted, but how we handle such differences is key.\n\u201cIn America, we solve our differences with debates and ballots, not with bricks and Molotov cocktails.\u201d\nBesides Yost, the letter was signed by the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\r\nMEDIA CONTACT:\r\nHannah Hundley: 614-906-9113\n-30-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals & Families\nConsumers\nMilitary & Veterans\nParents\nSeniors\nTipster\nVictims\nTask Force on Criminal Justice and Mental Illness\n\n\n\n\nBusiness & Development\nBackground Check\nServices for Bingo\nCollections\nProfessional Solicitors & Fundraisers\nServices for Charities\nServices for Business\n\n\n\n\nLaw Enforcement\nBCI\nConcealed Carry\nMissing Persons\nOhio Law Enforcement Gateway\nOOCIC\nOPOTA\nUnsolved Homicides\n\n\n\n\nLegal Community\nAntitrust\nBallot Initiatives\nOutside Counsel\nProsecution\nSunshine Laws\n\n\n\n\nState & Local Government\nThe Mount Vernon Project:School of Public Service\nFormal Opinions\nOhio School Threat Assessment Training\nServices for Schools\nOneOhio Notice\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the AGO\nDave Yost\nAdministration\nPublic Records Access\nRegional Offices\nService Divisions\n\n\n\n\nServices\nWebcheck Locations\nFile a Consumer Complaint\nFile a Charitable Complaint\nCharitable Registration\nTobacco Enforcement\n\n\n\n\nTraining & Education\nNonprofit Board Governance Webinars\nOhio's Charitable Registration System Webinars\nOnline Sunshine Laws Training\nOPOTA Courses\nVictim Service Provider Training\n\n\n\n\nMedia\nEvents\nNews Releases\nNewsletters\nReports\nVideos\n\n\n\n\nCareer & Employee Resources\nAG Employee Portal\nmyOhio.gov\nDiversity & Inclusion\nJob Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice under the Americans with Disabilities Act \u00a0\u00a0 | \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n                    Privacy Statement \u00a0\u00a0 | \u00a0\u00a0\r\n                    Ohio Checkbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
