While many students at our school hold pro-life values considering their religion, it\u2019s still important to provide opportunities to discuss pro-life apologetics so students can defend their beliefs. \u00a0\nOne of our group\u2019s most popular apologetics events is National Pro-Life Chalk Day, where we chalk pro-life art and sayings on the sidewalk in front of our school building. Here\u2019s how we switched things up this year and the reaction it received: \u00a0\n\n\nWe wanted to hold something like a\u00a0Cemetery of the Innocents\u00a0display (where crosses or flags are put out to memorialize preborn children lost to abortion)\u00a0to inform our student body of the widespread effects of abortion and to show them that, despite Roe v. Wade being reversed and the loss of the Value Them Both Amendment, abortion is a prevalent issue in our state and nation.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why for National Pro-Life Chalk Day this fall, our SFLA group, Heritage Students for Life, chalked 2,363 hearts on the sidewalk in front of our school to represent the 2,363 preborn children killed in the United States daily by abortion.\u202f We had thirteen students come out to help, and it took us thirty minutes to chalk all of the hearts. We also created posters sharing what the hearts represented and directed students to Live Action\u2019s website: 2363.org.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nOur display caused quite a bit of discussion among our school community (which is exactly what we had hoped for). We focused our conversations on the violence of abortion and the scale at which it occurs, especially in our community. Not many people who live in our city know that there are two abortion facilities nearby that perform abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy, or that the abortion industry in Kansas has been booming due to travelers from other states with more stringent abortion restrictions coming to\u202fKansas. \u00a0\nWe challenged students to define their position on abortion, and we had four new students who were interested in joining us in our mission to make abortion inaccessible and unthinkable. They became members of our group, and we are excited to have them. \u00a0\nAt our school, we have lots of students who hold pro-life convictions, but many do not know how to put those beliefs into practice. Our display helped students get plugged into pro-life activism and supportive services, and the response that the student body had makes me hopeful for the pro-life movement in Kansas and throughout the nation.\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Catholic Schools Are Forgetting Their Pro-Life Values; The Pro-Life Gen Needs to Remind Them\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 1,078\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
