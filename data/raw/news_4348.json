She said she backed the ROE Act amendment, filed by Sen. Harriette Chandler, because they\u2019re trying to safeguard the state against a possible reversal in Roe v. Wade no one could have predicted four months ago.No one could have predicted Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg would have died, Spilka told MassLive. Nor could anyone have predicted President Donald Trump would successfully nominate Amy Coney Barrett, a staunch opponent of abortion.\u201cNobody knew this, and I do believe as legislators we need to be fluid to some extent and respond to the moment,\u201d she said.The Senate ultimately approved the abortion proposal as part of the nearly $46 billion budget. Thirty-three senators voted for the proposal, while seven voted against. Republican Sens. Ryan Fattman, Patrick O\u2019Connor, Dean Tran and Tarr voted no. Democratic Sens. Michael Rush, Walter Timilty and John Velis also opposed the amendment.The legislation, named after a bill called the ROE Act, allows abortions after 24 weeks in certain cases and allows pregnant people age 16 or older to get abortions without consent from their parents or judicial approval. The House passed a similar provision during budget negotiations last week.Efforts to expand abortion protections as part of the fiscal 2021 budget have riled Massachusetts Republicans, who reminded Democratic leaders they said the extended session would focus on the budget, conference committee and any unprecedented COVID-19 matters.House Republicans blasted DeLeo over the abortion proposal, but they ultimately failed to stop the abortion protections from getting added to the $46 billion House budget plan.The move sparked criticism from Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican.\u201cI do share some of the unhappiness that was raised by a number of members of the Republican Party that putting policy in the budget was something that both leaders in the House and Senate said they would not do,\u201d Baker told reporters at a recent news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to argue this isn\u2019t a major policy initiative that is not in the budget.\u201dMassachusetts Gov. Charlie BakerBHSenate Republicans made similar criticisms when the Senate reviewed an amendment. Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr questioned why the Senate was trying to move forward with legislation that had not been favorably reported out of committee.\u201cOur body has been on record and has shown consensus on being able to achieve progress on issues relative to reproductive rights,\u201d Tarr said, referring to a 2018 bill removing or clarifying outdated reproductive health statutes, \u201cbut now we are about to depart from the incredible focus that we have had in this legislative session since the declaration of the public health emergency ... We are also going to depart from something else, which is the respect for the committee process.\u201dSen. Patrick O\u2019Connor issued his own proposal to limit the parameters of Chandler\u2019s amendment, including establishing a commission to study abortion rights for teenagers over 18 years rather than expanding the law. It failed.\u201cWe should pause with the under-18 language because we don\u2019t know the impacts of it,\u201d the Weymouth Republican said. \u201cAt the same time we do that commission, we expand access to judicial bypass across the state and we fix the issues in it.\u201dOther amendments related to the abortion protections filed by Tarr and Sen. Dean Tran, a Fitchburg Republican, also failed.The ROE Act proposal in the budget is a preemptive attempt to protect Massachusetts against a reversal of the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling made nearly four decades ago. Democratic leaders say the Supreme Court is better positioned than ever before to overturn the ruling now that it has a conservative majority.\u201cThere are 17 cases on the doorstep of the Supreme Court waiting to be heard to overturn parts or all of Roe v. Wade. They\u2019re just waiting. We\u2019re not waiting for a rainy day,\u201d said Chandler, Senate president emeritus, in a phone interview. \u201cI think the rain is here, and I think we have to prepare for that.\u201dSen. Rebecca Rausch, a Needham Democrat, said she\u2019s never known a time when abortion has been illegal and fears the return to back-alley abortions if the Supreme Court overturns the ruling.\u201cThere is a risk that when Roe falls, all of the Massachusetts pieces also fall. Should that happen, all that our constituents will have left is whatever exists on our statutory books,\u201d she told lawmakers during session. \u201cCurrent statutory law in Massachusetts governing abortion is archaic, medically inaccurate, politically charged and designed to discourage and shame pregnant people seeking abortion care.\u201dThe Senate plans to review the remaining proposals and pass a budget plan by the end of the day. The House and Senate would need to reconcile their differences before sending a finalized budget to the governor\u2019s desk.When asked about the abortion proposals, Baker noted that he had worked together with the Legislature to clarify state statutes and remove outdated language about reproductive rights through the NASTY Women Act of 2018. He expressed concerns over the addition of the abortion amendment, but he held off on saying he would veto that portion of a budget if it landed on his desk.If he did, Chandler noted both the House and Senate passed the abortion proposals with a supermajority of support. She\u2019s confident lawmakers could overcome a governor\u2019s veto, but she hopes that\u2019s not necessary.\u201cThe governor really has supported a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d the Worcester Democrat said. \u201cI have great faith in this governor because he understands health care and, frankly, abortion is health care.\u201dRelated Content:Senate President Karen Spilka expects to see abortion protections tacked onto nearly $46 billion fiscal 2021 budgetMassachusetts House approves $46 billion budget with abortion rights legislation attachedAddition of abortion proposal in state budget draws criticism from Gov.
