And that's something Ohio Republican legislators appear ready to stop.Senate Bill 260 passed the Ohio House 54-30\u00a0shortly before midnight Thursday\u00a0after Republicans blocked debate. If signed by the governor, it would ban the use of telemedicine for medication abortions by requiring\u00a0physicians to be physically present. Doctors who violate\u00a0the law could face felony charges.\u00a0Republicans who dominate both branches of the legislature and Ohio Right to Life say this would protect women seeking abortions. But Democrats and Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio say it would only make things more complicated and more expensive.\u00a0Medication or medical abortion is legal in Ohio until 10 weeks after the first day of a woman's last period. It's done using two drugs given about 48 hours apart. SB 260 would prohibit abortion providers from giving the first dose remotely.\u00a0\"The actual abortion still happens at home. They would\u00a0just take the medicine there,\" NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio spokesman Gabriel Mann said. \"It has zero impact on safety, but it has a massive impact on cost.\"Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter GuidePlanned Parenthood told NPR last\u00a0spring that its clinics in Iowa saw a 33% increase in telemedicine abortion services. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio didn't have numbers on how many women have requested telehealth services for their second visits.\"I think it\u2019s one more attempt to limit access to legal, safe abortion in the state of Ohio,\" Rep. Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said.\u00a0But Donna Harrison, from the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, disagreed. In her testimony to a House committee, she said\u00a0telemedicine shouldn't be used for procedures and taking an abortion pill is a procedure.She and others pointed to the fact that the Food and Drug Administration requires the first pill,\u00a0mifepristone, to be dispensed in a doctor\u2019s office, clinic or hospital.\u00a0\"It is clear from the scientific literature that telemedicine abortions in remote areas will initiate a procedure that commonly results in hemorrhage, ER visits, need for emergency surgery, transfusions, etc.,\" Harrison said.\u00a0\"This places the women in remote areas at the highest risk of turning a manageable complication into something life-threatening or fatal.\"\u00a0However, the FDA has an ongoing\u00a0TelAbortion Study in\u00a0eight states where all visits for medication abortions are done remotely. Any required tests (blood work, ultrasounds) are done\u00a0at local facilities and the pills are mailed to the patient's home.\u00a0\"The\u00a0argument\u00a0that it is not safe is a fringe opinion,\" Russo said.\u00a0The bill is headed to the governor's desk.astaver@dispatch.com\u00a0@annastaverAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated which steps in the medication abortion process were required to be in-person.\u00a0Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper Archives ThisWeek News ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best Events LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.dispatch.com.
