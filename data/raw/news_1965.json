(AP) \u2014 Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a bill Monday that bans abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy and restricts gender-affirming medical care for people younger than 19.The abortion ban takes effect immediately, while the ban on gender-affirming care takes effect on Oct. 1. The hybrid measure ties together restrictions that Republicans have pursued across the U.S.Pillen called the law \u201cthe most significant win for social conservative agenda in over a generation of Nebraska\u201d before he signed the law while holding the 5-day-old daughter of some friends as his two oldest granddaughters stood next to him.\u201cIt\u2019s about protecting our kids and saving babies. Pure and simple,\u201d Pillen said. Opponents have promised to sue to try and block the law. The head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, Mindy Rush Chipman, said in a statement that \u201cevery option is on the table to undo these regressive measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s decision to sign these sweeping restrictions into law betrays a total disregard for Nebraskans\u2019 freedom, health and well-being,\u201d Rush Chipman said. \u201cJust as we have seen in other states, these bans will result in significant harm, most intensely hurting already vulnerable communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new kind of hospital is coming to rural America. To qualify, facilities must close their beds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska governor blames university leadership for AD Trev Alberts\u2019 sudden departure for Texas A&M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrev Alberts is leaving Nebraska to become Texas A&M\u2019s athletic director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska had not passed a new abortion ban since 2010, when it became the first state to limit the procedure at around 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 12-week ban includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who pursued even tougher abortion restrictions during the session, wiped away tears as she said she hopes to eventually enact a ban at all stages of pregnancy.Planned Parenthood, which operates two of Nebraska\u2019s three abortion clinics, said the new law increases the burden on women who need abortions, forcing more of them to travel out of state. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that we have to tell patients that they cannot receive their health care here in Nebraska anymore,\u201d said Andi Curry Grubb, Nebraska executive director for Planned Parenthood North Central States.The law forced Planned Parenthood to reschedule three patients this week, and Curry Grubb said that within her five-state region, there has been a 40% increase in second-trimester abortions since Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer. More women are being forced to push abortions later into pregnancy because of hurdles involved with seeking care out of state. She said it\u2019s troubling that the new law doesn\u2019t include any exception for fetal anomalies, which may not be diagnosed until after the 12th week of pregnancy.North Carolina also recently passed a 12-week abortion ban, among a slew of restrictions enacted in states after the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. Fourteen states have approved an abortion ban throughout pregnancy.Nebraska\u2019s law also will prevent transgender people under 19 from receiving any gender-confirming surgery. It restricts the use of hormone treatments and puberty blockers in minors, putting the state\u2019s chief medical officer \u2014 a political appointee who is an ear, nose and throat doctor \u2014 in charge of setting the rules for those therapies. In Nebraska, people younger than 19 are considered minors.\n\nThe state\u2019s unicameral Legislature passed the bill with the two contentious issues on Friday after hours of heated debate. Conservative lawmakers wrangled just enough votes to end a filibuster before approving the bill. The proposal restricting gender-affirming care was the flashpoint of an epic filibuster led by Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh. She and a handful of progressive allies slowed the business of passing laws to a crawl by introducing amendment after amendment to every bill that made it to the Senate floor. That sent leadership scrambling to prioritize which bills to push through. Omaha Sen. Kathleen Kauth, who introduced the proposal restricting gender-affirming care, said Monday that the filibuster actually gave senators more time to discuss and research the issue.\n\n\u201cThe filibuster actually is what made this happen,\u201d Kauth said. \u201cAnd so I doubt it was their intention, but that gave us the time to make this work.\u201dNebraska is now among at least 18 states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for minors. Proposals are pending before the governors of Texas and Missouri. Medical groups and advocates say such restrictions are further marginalizing transgender youth and threatening their health.One Nebraska lawmaker, Omaha state Sen. Megan Hunt, disclosed in March that her teenage son is transgender and said Friday that she now plans to leave the state.Pillen said he didn\u2019t want Nebraska families considering gender-affirming medical care to be \u201cduped into the silliness that if you do this, you\u2019re going to become happy.\u201d ___Funk contributed to this story from Omaha, Neb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Josh Funk\n            \n\n                Josh covers railroads & Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
