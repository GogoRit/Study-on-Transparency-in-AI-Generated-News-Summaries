Sayuri Fujita, a Japanese-born television star, seemed aware of this as she posted a joyful photo of herself and her newborn on social media, writing, \u201cBecoming a single mother was not an easy decision, but it is also not a shameful decision. I want to thank my son for making me a proud mother.\u201d\nGiving birth outside of marriage is often stigmatized due to the country\u2019s Confucian culture and patriarchal family structures in which women are seen as less valued.\nAn estimated 20,761 single-parent households are headed by unmarried mothers in South Korea. The actual number may be significantly higher, as stigma leads some to conceal their unmarried status. Lack of social acceptance for unwed mothers and their children means they are more likely to be living in poverty and be socially isolated.\nAlthough South Korea\u2019s birth rate is among the lowest in the world, and the government is concerned about the country\u2019s aging population, artificial insemination and IVF treatments are not an option for unmarried women. Sperm banks set their own criteria for accepting patients and will not provide services to unmarried women.\nBut public attitudes towards single parenthood are changing; a recent survey found 31 percent of South Koreans accept having children without getting married. \u00a0\nSouth Korean women and girls have long faced violations of their reproductive rights as the government pursued policies seeking at different times to reduce and then increase the birth rate. Stigma against unmarried mothers\u2014and severe restrictions on abortion--helped drive high rates of international adoption from South Korea. Women have long fought for access to abortion, and the country\u2019s Constitutional Court recently ordered the government to reverse its abortion ban.\nIt is high time for South Korea to fully respect reproductive rights. The government should eliminate barriers to accessing abortion and make assisted reproductive services available for everyone, no matter their marital status, sexual orientation, or family configuration. It should also act to eradicate all forms of discrimination and stigma against single parents, particularly unwed mothers. Everyone has a right to decide for themselves if they want a family or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nAsia Europe/Central Asia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 29, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nBangladesh: Pivotal Moment to Stop Violence Against Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSouth Korea Partially Recognizes Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAbused by Relatives, Ignored by the State\n\n\nDomestic Violence Against and Neglect of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cSchools are Failing Boys Too\u201d\n\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s Impact on Boys\u2019 Education in Afghanistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 29, 2020\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nBangladesh: Pivotal Moment to Stop Violence Against Women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nSouth Korea Partially Recognizes Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
