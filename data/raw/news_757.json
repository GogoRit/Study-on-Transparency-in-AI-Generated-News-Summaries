Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, nearly two dozen US states have banned or limited access to the procedure. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity.\n    \n\n            All eyes are on Ohio this election cycle, as voters will be deciding whether to add an amendment protecting abortion rights in the state constitution. In a special election in August, Ohio voters rejected an initiative that would have made it harder to amend the state constitution \u2014 a critical victory for abortion rights advocates.\n    \n\n            The fight over abortion is well underway in state legislatures. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced on Sept. 18 that it would\u202fresume abortion care services, after a judge ruled that a law from 1849 widely interpreted as an abortion ban did not apply to abortion procedures.\u202f The South Carolina Supreme Court in August reversed a temporary block on a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d\u202f\u2014 which would ban abortion at the time when a fetus\u2019 heartbeat can be detected, usually as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. \n    \n\n            This year, health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced. In July,\u202fIowa banned most abortions\u202fat about six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they are pregnant. A district judge, however,\u202fplaced a temporary hold \u202fjust a few days after it went into effect. Abortions remain legal in Iowa until 22 weeks. \u202fAlso in July, a \u202fWisconsin\u202fjudge\u202fblocked a first-of-its-kind ban\u202fon abortion pills a week before it was intended to take effect\u202fin the state.\u202fGeorgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban\u202fwas stopped last November\u202fby a state court, but days later,\u202fthe state\u2019s\u202fSupreme Court allowed the\u202fban to go into effect\u202fwhile an appeal plays out. \n    \n\n            As these legal challenges make their way through the courts, patients seeking access to the procedure must navigate a complicated patchwork of legislation, often requiring them to travel hundreds of miles.\n\n\n            Here\u2019s where abortion access currently stands in the United States.\n
