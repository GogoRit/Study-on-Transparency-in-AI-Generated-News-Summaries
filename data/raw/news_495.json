Robin Bartleman, whose second pregnancy ended in tragedy, tells Florida legislators they have no right to intervene in intimate decisions about bearing or aborting a disabled fetus. Screenshot: The Florida Channel\n\n\n\n\n\nA woman carrying a fetus diagnosed with a genetic disorder would not be allowed to terminate the pregnancy under a proposed law backed by Republicans and approved Friday in the GOP-controlled Florida House of Representatives.\nDemocrats denounced the plan, saying it lets government usurp an intimate decision by such a woman and predicting it would be found unconstitutional in court challenges that are sure to come.\nThe proposal, House Bill 1221, sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall and 12 other House Republicans, would prohibit a doctor from performing an abortion if he or she knows or should know that the patient wants to terminate the pregnancy \u201csolely on the basis of a test result or diagnosis\u201d showing the fetus to have a genetically inherited disability.\nViolations would subject the doctor to a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000.\nIt defines those as a physical disfigurement, scoliosis, dwarfism, Down syndrome, albinism, amelia, or a physical or mental disease.\nThe prohibition would not apply if the pregnancy endangers the woman\u2019s life.\nThe House bill, adopted 74-44 over Democratic opposition, has no counterpart in the Florida Senate but still could be taken up in that chamber if it so chooses. Next week is the final week of the regular legislative session.\n\u201cAll lives matter, always. We have a duty to protect innocent life,\u201d said Rep. Clay Yarborough, a Duval County Republican, who cited Bible passages in his support of the bill.\nRep. Grall said it is wrong for anyone to decide the future quality of life of a fetus, regardless of medical indications.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t hear from the boys and girls who are never given the opportunity to determine whether or not their quality of life is adequate, and that is who I ask you to stand for today,\u201d said Grall, a Republican representing parts of Indian River and St. Lucie counties.\nRep. Robin Bartleman, a special-education teacher and mother of two, trembled and shed tears as she described on the House floor her tragic second pregnancy.\nShe said she and her husband were informed the fetus she was carrying was severely deformed and they should contemplate whether to abort. Before they reached a decision, the fetus died in utero. Bartleman, a Broward County Democrat, implored House members not to assume a legal role in making that excruciating decision.\n\u201cThat was my decision. That was my husband\u2019s decision. That was a pregnancy that we prayed for, worked for, I had hormone treatments for. Don\u2019t insert yourself into my family\u2019s decision,\u201d Bartleman said, visibly shaking. \u201cThis was such a personal, personal, personal decision. Please stay out of our decisions when it comes to this. None of us want our children to be in pain.\u201d\nRep. Allison Tant, mother of a severely disabled adult child, said her family has the resources to withstand the lifelong challenges and expenses of caring for her son, but that many families do not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about supporting these families,\u201d Tant said. \u201cI was determined to have this baby or die trying. Every family must have the right to make their own decision.\u201d\nRepublican Rep. Elizabeth Fetterhoff of Volusia County said that she, herself, might have been aborted because of birth defects diagnosed in utero, but her mother refused. She survived groundbreaking surgery after being born at the University of Florida\u2019s Shands Hospital, she said.\n\u201cShe chose life, and I stand before you today, a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing my district and working to provide the best quality of life for all Floridians, including those with disabilities,\u201d Fetterhoff said.\nWhile banning disability abortions, the House bill also mandates the state provide educational information about prenatal genetic disorders and resources available to families of disabled children; and requires a health care practitioner who orders or administers a prenatal screening or diagnostic test to provide the patient with that information if the test results indicate a genetic disorder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXFL House Republicans vote to ban abortions when prenatal tests reveal disabilities\nby Laura Cassels, Florida Phoenix April 23, 2021\nFL House Republicans vote to ban abortions when prenatal tests reveal disabilities\nby Laura Cassels, Florida Phoenix April 23, 2021\n A woman carrying a fetus diagnosed with a genetic disorder would not be allowed to terminate the pregnancy under a proposed law backed by Republicans and approved Friday in the GOP-controlled Florida House of Representatives.\nDemocrats denounced the plan, saying it lets government usurp an intimate decision by such a woman and predicting it would be found unconstitutional in court challenges that are sure to come.\nThe proposal, House Bill 1221, sponsored by Rep.
