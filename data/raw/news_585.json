The party denies the charge. \n\"No law-abiding government should respect this ruling,\" Borys Budka, leader of Poland's largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, told reporters, according to Reuters. \nPolish President Andrzej Duda said he supports the decision. \n\"I have said it many times, and I have never concealed it, that abortion for so-called eugenic reasons should not be allowed in Poland. I believed and believe that every child has a right to life,\" he said in an interview last October with Dziennik Gazeta Prawna. \nLegal abortions have reportedly been declining in Poland, as some doctors are refusing to perform the procedure based on religious grounds, Reuters reported. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOA News\n\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.
