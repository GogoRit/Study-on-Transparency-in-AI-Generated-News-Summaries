Glenn Youngkin has pushed for stricter abortion laws.Christopher Wilson\u00b7Senior WriterJanuary 12, 2023 at 2:08 AM\u00b73 min readLink CopiedRead full articleVirginia Beach Councilman Aaron Rouse and Jennifer Rouse attend the Mighty Dream Forum on Nov. 2, 2022, in Norfolk, Va. (Jemal Countess/Getty Images)Democrats flipped a state senate seat in a Virginia special election Tuesday night, likely scuttling Republican plans for a stricter abortion law in the state.While the race has not officially been called, Virginia Beach Councilman Aaron Rouse declared victory over Navy veteran Kevin Adams, filling a seat vacated after Republican Jen Kiggans won her bid for the U.S. House in November. The win gives Democrats a 22-18 edge in the chamber, decreasing the chances Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will be able to pass his proposed 15-week abortion ban this year.Rouse, who previously played in the NFL after earning all-conference honors at Virginia Tech, ran on abortion rights while Adams tried to frame him as soft on crime, a common juxtaposition in many of last year\u2019s key midterm races.Aaron Rouse at Scott Stadium in Charlottesville, Va., in 2005. (Randy Litzinger/Icon SMI/ZUMA Press)\u201cI want to protect women\u2019s reproductive health care. I want to make sure we build a thriving economy that works for everyone and our public education system. We have to support our teachers, our staff and our students,\u201d Rouse said Tuesday night, adding, \u201cIt means a lot to me to know the community I grew up with has my back, and I have theirs, and I\u2019m looking forward to serving them in Richmond.\u201dFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade last summer, Youngkin announced his plan to ban most abortions after 15 weeks, with that legislation being formally filed in the state legislature Wednesday morning. Virginia currently allows abortion through the second trimester, or about 26 weeks, with access after that only if three doctors certify that the mother\u2019s health is at risk.Groups on both sides of the abortion policy fight invested in the race, which Kiggans had won narrowly in 2019. Adams did not campaign on new abortion restrictions but supported the governor\u2019s plan. \u201cWe need to pass laws that respect the rights of the mom and baby, limit late-term abortion by passing Glenn Youngkin\u2019s 15-week legislation, while providing reasonable exceptions to protect the life of the mother or in the instance of rape or incest,\u201d Adams said on the platform section of his website.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin at a campaign rally in October 2022 in Westchester, N.Y. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AP)In an interview with Politico last month, Rouse said he supported \u201cthe current law of Virginia as it is and will fiercely defend against any legislation that will ban abortion in our state, our commonwealth.\u201d\u201cThis seat is critical to ensure that we can protect the rights of women\u2019s reproductive health care,\u201d he added.Democrats were concerned that an Adams victory would have potentially allowed the legislation to pass, as one Democratic state senator has expressed openness to new restrictions on abortion and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, would have the ability to break any ties.All 40 state Senate seats are up for election this fall, in addition to the entire House of Delegates. With Youngkin\u2019s term running through the end of 2025, abortion access is likely to remain a key issue in future races.
