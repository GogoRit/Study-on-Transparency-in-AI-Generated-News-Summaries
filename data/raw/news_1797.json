LaRose now will work with local election boards to determine that at least 413,446 are valid, which would get the proposal onto the Nov. 7 ballot.\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court says abortion, reproductive ballot issue will be single question\n\u201cToday, we take a huge step forward in the fight for abortion access and reproductive freedom for all, to ensure that Ohioans and their families can make their own health care decisions without government interference,\u201d Lauren Blauvelt and Kellie Copeland of Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, a coalition member, said in a statement.\nAt a news conference, Copeland said the 422 boxes delivered \u201care filled with hope and love and dreams of freedom, of bodily autonomy, of health, of being able to say, \u2018We decide what happens to us.\u2019\u201d\nThe ballot measure calls for the establishment of \u201ca fundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d with \u201creasonable limits.\u201d In language similar to a constitutional amendment that Michigan voters approved in November, it would require restrictions imposed past a fetus\u2019 viability outside the womb, which is typically around the 24th week of pregnancy and was the standard under Roe v. Wade, to be based on evidence of patient health and safety benefits.\nThe state\u2019s formidable anti-abortion network has vowed a dogged and well-funded opposition campaign, which could take the price tag for the fight above $70 million.\nProtect Women Ohio, the opposition campaign, downplayed the huge number of signatures submitted, saying they were collected with help from paid signature-gatherers funded in part of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it described as \u201canti-parent.\u201d Abortion foes contend that the Ohio amendment has the potential to trump the state\u2019s abortion-related parental consent law, though the lawyers who wrote it deny the claim.\n\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s attempts to hijack Ohio\u2019s constitution to further its own radical agenda would be pathetic if they weren\u2019t so dangerous,\u201d campaign press secretary Amy Natoce said in a statement.\nREAD MORE: Federal judge allows most of North Carolina\u2019s revised 12-week abortion ban to take effect\nTwo legal challenges have gone proponents\u2019 way.\nThe first was a decision by the Ohio Supreme Court that allowed the measure to proceed as a single issue, rather than as two questions that would have required twice as many signatures. Justices found that the proposed amendment\u2019s call to protect individuals\u2019 rights to make their own decisions about a continuum of reproductive care issues \u2014 contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one\u2019s pregnancy, miscarriage care and abortion \u2014 met the standard of applying to the \u201csame general purpose.\u201d\nIn a second ruling, the court denied Republican Attorney General Dave Yost\u2019s request that justices launch a review of the right to an abortion under the Ohio Constitution, leaving those arguments to play out in a lower court and keeping alive the purpose of the proposed amendment.\nBut the ruling that might have the biggest impact favored abortion opponents. It allowed an August special election to proceed that will seek to raise the threshold for passing future amendments \u2014 including as soon as November \u2014 from a 50%-plus-one simple majority that has been in place since 1912 to a 60% majority. Abortion rights amendments in other states have tended to pass with more than 55% but less than 60% of the vote.\nThe outcome of that August election also could affect a recreational marijuana question for which supporters planned to submit signatures later Wednesday. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol is pursuing ballot access for its proposal to legalize marijuana for adult use after the Republican-controlled Legislature failed to act on their initiated statute.\nREAD MORE: Why post-Roe abortion restrictions worry domestic violence experts\nIt would appear alongside an Ohio abortion rights effort prompted by last summer\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion and instead leaving it to states to decide for themselves.\nIn the first statewide test following that decision, Kansas voters resoundingly protected abortion rights last August. Meanwhile, four other states in addition to Michigan \u2014 California, Kentucky, Montana and Vermont \u2014 either enshrined abortion rights or rejected constitutional restrictions on the procedure in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Abortion rights protesters hold signs to keep abortion safe in Ohio at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, after the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Dobbs v Women's Health Organization abortion case, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision, June 24, 2022.
