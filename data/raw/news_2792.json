(CNS photo/Leslie E. Kossoff)\n\nWASHINGTON (CNS) \u2014 The Sept. 10 announcement of the theme for the March for Life \u2014 \u201cTogether Strong: Life Unites\u201d \u2014 made it clear the annual national event, in some form, will proceed next Jan. 29.\nBut details of how the march, rally and pro-life conference, which together have drawn as many as 100,000 participants in past years, will cope with COVID-19 self-quarantine restrictions in the District of Columbia were not part of the announcement.\nAsked on EWTN\u2019s \u201cPro-Life Weekly\u201d program that evening about whether people should start making plans, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, said: \u201cYou know, everybody has to make that decision on their own. You know, considering their own situations, et cetera.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cBut I certainly would be (making plans), and I obviously will be there this year. I think that standing for life and standing for inherent human dignity of every life from conception to natural death is all the more important this year when there is so much unrest, so much division in our country. We need to show that we are stronger together and that love and life unite us. They make us stronger.\u201d\nIn July, Mancini had said \u201cwe will continue to discern throughout this year what steps should be taken,\u201d regarding pandemic restrictions.\nSocial distancing and masks aren\u2019t the issue. Washington health authorities require a 14-day self-quarantine for visitors \u201cparticipating in nonessential travel\u201d from high-risk areas. The quarantine is adjusted every two weeks, and as of Sept. 8, was extended to visitors from 30 states.\nThat\u2019s a particular obstacle for the many high school and college groups who arrive on long-distance bus rides which have, over the decades, become the pulse of the event.\n\u201cIf D.C. is still requiring a two-week quarantine for out-of-state travelers, I don\u2019t see a way for us to attend,\u201d said Ed Konieczka, assistant director of university ministry at the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota. \u201cWe are taking care of the details that we can, and recognizing which things are out of our control.\u201d\nThe university typically sends around 200 students and staff members to the march, and in 2018, some 20 students flanked President Donald Trump in the Rose Garden at the White House when he addressed the Mall rally on a video link. This past January, Trump addressed the rally in person, becoming the first president to do so.\nThe alternative to a Washington trip, Konieczka said, will be a rally that day in Bismarck. \u201cWe have been approached by the Diocese of Bismarck with a request to coordinate efforts to have the biggest March for Life event ever at our state capital. We have a shared vision for a large event, where any of our students unable to travel to D.C. will join with members of the diocese.\u201d\nPlanners of state marches face the same uncertainty. \u201cRight now with COVID and the restrictions, we are playing it by ear in Chicago,\u201d said Denise Zabor, office manager for Illinois Right to Life.\nMarch for Life has taken place in Washington every January since 1974. It\u2019s always held on a date near the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 rulings, Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, which legalized abortion on demand.\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s the rallying point for all of pro-life America,\u201d said Dave Bereit, the founder of 40 Days for Life, who co-hosted the theme announcement with Mancini.\nAmong those making remarks during the announcement were Carrie Severino, president of Judicial Crisis Network, and U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, who chairs the bipartisan Pro-Life Caucus in the House of Representatives.\n\u201cOne of the most significant decisions a president has to make is who to put on the federal courts,\u201d Severino said. She warned of the danger of judges \u201cwho think it is their job to invent new constitutional rights.\u201d\nWhile Trump recently provided a list of future Supreme Court nominees, Severino observed, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a Catholic, \u201cwon\u2019t tell us who he\u2019ll put on the court\u201d and he supports \u201cusing your federal tax dollars to pay for abortions. The choice couldn\u2019t be more clear.\u201d\n\u201c(After) the eight years of Obama-Biden, which didn\u2019t even enforce existing laws protecting conscience rights,\u201d Smith said \u201csignificant pro-life progress has been achieved\u201d by Trump\u2019s executive orders and his leadership.\nThe announcement video included a cameo from Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime supporter of the March for Life, who said: \u201cStand for life. Because life is winning.\u201d\nOn Sept. 3, the Trump campaign, in a letter to a coalition calling itself \u201cPro-Life Voices for Trump,\u201d cited how the president has been \u201ctransforming the federal judiciary\u201d by appointing federal judges and Supreme Court justices \u201cwho would not legislate an abortion agenda from the bench.\u201d\nThe letter also promised to work for the passage of what\u2019s called the \u201cpain-capable\u201d abortion ban, which has criminal penalties for abortions performed when an unborn child is in at least the 20th week of gestation; supporters of the measure cite scientific research showing a fetus at that stage can feel pain. Passage has been blocked by House Democrats and the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.\nTrump also expressed support for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act sponsored by Mississippi Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, which would codify an end to federal funding for abortion such as that received by Planned Parenthood.\nCo-chairing \u201cPro-Life Voices for Trump\u201d are Marjorie Dannenfelser, chairman of the Susan B. Anthony List, and Christina Bennett, communications director for the Family Institute of Connecticut.\n\u2018We are resolved to end this,\u201d Dannenfelser said about abortion during the March for Life announcement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re on a verge of a great victory. Life is winning in America, and we\u2019re just moments away \u2026 from ending one of the great human rights abuses of our time.\u201d\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nEditor\u2019s Note: The March for Life website, https://marchforlife.org, provides visitors to the site a way to sign up for updates on the Jan. 29 event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep In Touch\n984-900-3200\n\n\nGet Email\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAddress\nThe Catholic Center\n7200 Stonehenge Drive\nRaleigh, NC 27613\nDirections\nOffice Hours\nMonday - Friday\n8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 The Catholic Diocese of Raleigh.
