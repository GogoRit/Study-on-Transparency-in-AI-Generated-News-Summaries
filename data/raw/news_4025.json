UNFPA stressed that immediate action is needed to save lives and ensure women\u2019s health and safety.\u00a0\n\u201cThe unavailability of obstetric services for pregnant women and the lack of access to safe delivery is the reason for loss of lives both for mothers and newborns,\u201d maintained Mr. Diana. \u201cOvercrowding at hospitals during instability is common and in the case of current events in West Darfur means that women are delivering babies in shared rooms or open squares.\u201d\nWhile an estimated 160 midwives have been deployed, the availability of safe delivery facilities remains inadequate, leaving women to give birth in makeshift spaces, including classrooms in the presence of other women and children.\u00a0\nUN steps up assistance\nUNFPA is supporting the State Ministry of Health and other partners in establishing sexual and reproductive health clinics in 31 IDP sites, which will include the services of 60 midwives.\u00a0\nThe UN agency has also shipped 31 different emergency reproductive health kits from Khartoum to El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, to cover the needs of pregnant women.\n\nHaving no access to emergency obstetric care leads to an increase in maternal and neonatal deaths -- UNFPA\n\n\u201cHaving no access to emergency obstetric care leads to an increase in maternal and neonatal deaths so this is a life-saving intervention,\u201d pointed out Mr. Diana.\nCredible information, including from rapid assessments, also indicates that amidst rising displacement, gender-based violence (GBV) is being perpetrated on a large scale and in different forms, especially for women and girls.\nThe Population Fund noted that a team of GBV and reproductive health coordinators were deployed to El Geneina and emergency reproductive health kits were dispatched to support the humanitarian response.\nMoreover, prevention and response efforts are being strengthened, including by coordinating and providing psychosocial support and other services.\u00a0\n\u201cGender-based violence\u2026is one of the most pervasive human-rights abuses in the world,\u201d the UNFPA Representative spelled out. \u201cBoth priorities must always be treated with immediate attention \u2013 regardless of whether it is an emergency or not.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSudanWest Darfurmaternal healthgender-based violence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Related Stories\n          \n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic violence, forced marriage, have risen in Sudan: UN-backed study  \n\n\nMonday\u2019s Daily Brief: the cost of maternal healthcare, Sudan and Chad updates, sustainability in focus\n\n\nSudan: Fighting in West Darfur triggers rising death toll\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Resources\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the News\n\n\nInformation for Broadcasters\n\n\nUN System Links\n\n\nMedia Alert\n\n\nUN Journal\n\n\nMeetings Coverage\n\n\nAudiovisual Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Secretary-General\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nAll Statements\n\n\nOfficial Travels\n\n\nPress Encounters\n\n\nSG Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Spokesperson's Office\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Statements\n\n\nBriefing Highlights\n\n\nBriefing Transcripts\n\n\nNotes to Correspondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Find Us\n      \n              \n\n\n Button collapse \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News App\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer menu\n      \n          \n\n\n\nA-Z Site Index\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nFraud Alert\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Social Media Links\n      \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Footer buttons\n      \n          \n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
