Sign up for our daily newsletter.\nFlorida moved one step closer to a six-week abortion ban that would severely curtail abortion access in the state and the region, advancing a bill that abortion rights supporters say is in many ways more restrictive than bans in Texas and elsewhere.\u00a0\nThe state Senate on Monday passed Senate Bill 300, sponsored by GOP Sen. Erin Grall. The bill, which Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign, would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many patients know they are pregnant. The proposed law would also require two separate visits to a health care provider to obtain an abortion and would ban providers from prescribing medication abortions via telemedicine or dispensing the medication through the mail.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will be the only state in the country with a six-week ban plus mandatory two trips without option for telehealth. It is beyond arcane,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book. \u201cIn Texas, if you live outside of 100 miles from an abortion provider, you can sign an informed consent waiver. We\u2019re not even doing that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe measure would go into effect if and when the Florida Supreme Court \u2014 which is stacked with conservative judges appointed by DeSantis \u2014 upholds the legality of a 15-week abortion ban the state enacted in 2022. Court observers anticipate a decision by the summer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to perceive that this is some far-off effective date,\u201d said Annie Filkowski, the policy director with the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.\nThe bill further prohibits organizations that receive state funds from supporting out-of-state travel for an abortion and directs $25 million in state funds to anti-abortion counseling centers.\u00a0\nThe provision on abortion-related travel seems to target efforts like one out of the city of St. Petersburg, which is considering allocating $50,000 to the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. Under the proposed law, abortion rights advocates believe a city paying for out-of-state travel for employees seeking abortions would be outlawed.\u00a0\nStephanie Loraine Pi\u00f1eiro, executive director of the Florida Access Network, an abortion fund, said many clinics nationwide, especially independent ones, have struggled to stay afloat in the face of strict abortion bans.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cMany providers were forced to shut down, if there is care available at all in their community,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just another way for our state to eliminate the possibility of counting on our local government to support us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Read Next:\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next:\n\n                        A proposed six-week abortion ban in Florida could threaten access for the entire South\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill makes exceptions for cases of rape and incest through 15 weeks of pregnancy, unlike the 15-week ban currently in effect, but requires a patient to provide a copy of a police report, restraining order or \u201cother court order or documentation.\u201d The bill also includes an exception in cases where the life of the pregnant patient is at risk but requires two physicians to sign off on the procedure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo previously said the inclusion of rape and incest exceptions in the legislation was her \u201cnumber one priority\u201d in deciding whether to support the bill. But advocates say the documentation requirements, on top of existing barriers, will effectively cut off abortion access. Passidomo did not respond to a request for comment submitted through an aide.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re relying on a justice system that doesn\u2019t believe survivors to begin with, it just compounds the problem,\u201d said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications and research at NARAL Pro-Choice America. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re stacking unattainable expectations on top of unattainable expectations. The intent here is to be able to point to exceptions, knowing full well they don\u2019t functionally exist.\u201d\n\u201cThe rape and incest exception in its current unworkable form is going to help more Republicans for reelection than it will help patients,\u201d Filkowski said.\nHouse Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said experts who have testified before the legislature have pointed out that the lack of health care facilities and physicians, particularly in the northern part of the state, will exacerbate the restrictions of the bill. She added that she is really concerned about the impact on people of color and low-income Floridians.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be an even more difficult determination for a woman who doesn\u2019t have access to health care, who is working two and three jobs,\u201d Driskell said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the time to do it on Ron DeSantis\u2019 timeline.\u201d\n\n\n\nSign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily\n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

The fast-tracking of the legislation also comes as DeSantis prepares to launch a 2024 presidential campaign.\nThe measure, if it goes into effect, would have significant consequences for abortion access not just in Florida, the nation\u2019s third-most populous state, but in the entire South.\u00a0\nPatients from Latin America and the Caribbean have long traveled to Florida for abortions. And the state became an even more critical access point for abortions after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading many neighboring states to ban or heavily restrict abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you go from being an alleged abortion haven, which it was for the South, to now, we\u2019re about to become the most restrictive in the South with a six-week ban and a 24-hour mandatory waiting period,\u201d Pi\u00f1eiro said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\u00a0\nA woman waits for an abortion consultation at a Planned Parenthood Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida in July 2022.\n (CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe state\u2019s Planned Parenthood health centers have seen a quadrupling in patients traveling from other states since Roe fell, with clinics in Tallahassee and Jacksonville, in the northern part of the state, absorbing most of the influx of new patients.\u00a0\nThe influx was evident in the state\u2019s abortion data: 82,192 people got abortions in Florida in 2022, compared with 79,817 in 2021. More than 6,500 people came to Florida from out of state, a 38 percent increase from the year before.\u00a0\nFlorida\u2019s State Agency for Health Care Administration also reported that last year, 115 abortions in Florida were performed because of rape and seven because of incest.\nIf Florida\u2019s six-week ban takes effect, North and South Carolina will be the closest states where abortion remains legal and accessible, though abortion access is under threat in those states, too.\u00a0\nThe advancement of SB 300 comes after months of advocacy by anti-abortion groups pushing Florida Republicans to further restrict abortion with their new legislative supermajorities.\n\u201cFlorida has become a destination state for the destruction of unborn life,\u201d Katie Daniel, state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a Tuesday statement. \u201cWe thank Sen. Erin Grall . . .\u00a0 and pro-life leaders in the Senate for championing SB 300 to create a policy that mirrors public opinion on the issue of life and expands resources for pregnant women and new moms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More Florida coverage\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Florida bill would bring bans on gender studies and critical race theory to colleges and universities\n                \n\n\n\n                    Trans youth in Florida can no longer start gender-affirming care, pushing families toward difficult decisions\n                \n\n\n\n\nA May 2022 survey from Florida Atlantic University found that 67 percent of Floridians believed abortions should be legal in all or most cases while 34 percent thought it should be illegal in all or most cases.\u00a0\nSome Florida-based groups are urging GOP lawmakers to make the bill more restrictive by removing the current exceptions for rape and incest. The group Florida Voice for the Unborn asked its supporters to call key House Republicans to urge them to scrap the exceptions so that \u201cALL unborn children are protected in post-Roe v. Wade Florida.\u201d\nA Senate hearing on Thursday took place less than a month from when the bill was first introduced, in what onlookers say has been an accelerated process compared with the timeline for other significant bills in Tallahassee. A version has also moved forward in the state House, and if lawmakers are able to reconcile the two versions, DeSantis could have a bill on his desk next week.\n\u201cDo I think it\u2019s going to be a six-week ban? Yes, I absolutely do,\u201d Book said. \u201cI have twins that are 6 years old, a little boy and a little girl. My daughter today has fewer rights than her brother does compared to the day they were born. And it has happened on my watch.\u201d\u00a0\nDriskell said that the bill\u2019s progress in Tallahassee doesn\u2019t reflect the views of the vast majority of Floridians on abortion.\n\u201cPeople are paying attention. The real challenge is whether it\u2019s going to translate to excitement at the polls more than a year away,\u201d Driskell said. \u201cThis is one of those bills that is going to restrict Floridians\u2019 freedom in a way like they\u2019ve never seen. And I do think ultimately, the voters will think that this is a bridge too far.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nA proposed six-week abortion ban in Florida could threaten access for the entire South\n\n\n\n\nFlorida\u2019s new restrictions will chip away at the little abortion access left in the South\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th Explains: Abortion in Florida and what\u2019s at stake in the state Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina passes 12-week abortion ban\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th News(letter)\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday. \n\n\n\nYou have been subscribed!\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree to\nthe terms\n\n\n\n\nPlease complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.
