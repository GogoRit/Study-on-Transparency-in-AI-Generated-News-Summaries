The protests were triggered by an Oct. 22 ruling by Poland\u2019s constitutional court that abortion in cases of severe fetal deformities was unconstitutional. The ruling further restricts what was already one of Europe\u2019s more restrictive abortion laws.\n\nWarsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, of the opposition Civic Platform party, joined the marchers and called for dialogue between the protesters and the government. His office later estimated the crowd at 100,000.Families with children took part in the march early on, joining mostly young, even teenage protesters who chanted slogans calling for the government to step down and for women to have freedom of choice. Many carried homemade cardboard signs, many serious, others playful.\nA car that drove in the procession had signs on its windows that said: \u201cI wish I could abort my government,\u201d and \u201cEven Shrek wouldn\u2019t want to live in such a swamp.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany also chanted obscenities against the conservative government, in what has been a distinguishing feature of these nine days of street protest.As in previous days, protests also took place in some other Polish cities.The march headed for the house of the right-wing ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, but police blocked the street at some distance from the house. It was not clear if Kaczynski was at home. \n\nHe is the most powerful politician in the country despite having only the government role of deputy prime minister. He has long supported a total ban on abortion and he is being blamed now for being behind the court ruling, issued by party loyalties.\u201cKaczynski set fire to Poland,\u201d said one sign held up at Warsaw\u2019s protest.Protesters ignored pandemic restrictions which ban public gatherings of more than five people, and disregarded government calls to stay home due to skyrocketing coronavirus infections. The nation of 38 million has hit new records for confirmed cases almost daily this week, including the 21,600 confirmed cases reported Friday.The national public prosecutor threatened criminal charges against protest organizers for \u201ccausing an epidemiological threat,\u201d a charge that carries a prison sentence of up to eight years.Klementyna Suchanow, one of the key organizers with the Poland\u2019s Women\u2019s Strike initiative, said she and many others refused to be deterred by either the virus or the authorities because they believe they are fighting for a fundamental right.\u201cThis is about the freedom and dignity of people,\u201d Suchanow said. \u201cThe will of people to protest should be a lesson for anyone who wants to impose authoritarian ways.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s abortion law was forged by political and Catholic Church leaders in 1993. It allowed abortion only in the cases of fetal defects, risk to the woman\u2019s health and pregnancies resulting from crimes \u2014 incest or rape.The recent ruling leaves only the woman\u2019s health or pregnancy resulting from crimes as legal reasons for abortion.Earlier attempts by the country\u2019s conservative ruling party to change the law to ban all abortions also prompted enormous street protests, including in 2016 and 2017.This time, Kaczynski appears to have calculated that he could change the law with less of a backlash by getting a court under his control to do it during the pandemic. If that was the case, the plan has backfired for now, though it remains unclear how long the protests will keep their momentum.The protests have included people disrupting church services and spray-painting slogans on churches last Sunday. Such actions and vulgarity have offended many people in the largely Catholic nation, even some who disagree with the court ruling.Kaczynski has since called on supporters to defend churches. Health Ministry figures show that 1,110 legal abortions were carried out in Poland in 2019, mostly because of fetal defects.___Monika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
