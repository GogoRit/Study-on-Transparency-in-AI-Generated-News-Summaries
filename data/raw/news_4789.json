Frank Pavone speaks in San Francisco's Civic Center before the 16th Annual Walk for Life, Saturday, Jan. 25, 2020, in San Francisco, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)Show Caption of ExpandBy Leonardo Casta\u00f1eda | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: January 25, 2020 at 2:54 p.m. | UPDATED: January 26, 2020 at 10:57 a.m.Thousands of pro-life activists converged in front of San Francisco\u2019s City Hall on Saturday for the annual Walk for Life in a festive mood, the day after federal health officials declared illegal a California rule that requires private insurers to provide abortion coverage.\nThe march, in its 16th year in San Francisco, protests the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide. On Friday, President Donald Trump became the first commander-in-chief to speak at the march in Washington, D.C., which has been held in the capital for more than four decades.\n\u201cThe momentum is on our side,\u201d Fr. Frank Pavone, director of Priests for Life, told a cheering crowd on Saturday.\nSince Trump\u2019s election, nearly 200 pro-life federal judges, including two Supreme Court justices, have been appointed, Pavone noted.\u00a0\u201cEach year we\u2019re seeing more and more pro-life laws,\u201d he said.\nJessica Munn, chair of San Mateo Pro-Life\u00a0 who has come to the walk in San Francisco every year, handed out literature, as well as plastic models of fetuses at different stages of development while attendees milled around.\n\u201cThis is one major way to educate people,\u201d she said, adding that she can talk to people individually and counter what she sees as misinformation about abortion in the media and popular culture. \n\n\nShe said the pro-life movement is growing in the country, but she wasn\u2019t overly optimistic about the recent news that private insurers in California may not be required to cover abortions.\n\u201cIt sounds wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see what happens in California.\u201d \n\n\nSeveral people held up signs representing various churches and religious groups in attendance, with some saying, \u201cchoose life\u201d and \u201cI am the pro-life generation.\u201d Before the speakers started, informational tables set up in the civic center plaza distributed literature about contraceptives and abortion, and sold t-shirts such as those designed like the Starbucks logo that said \u201cchoose life.\u201d\nAfter several speakers addressed the crowd, described by some attendees as the second-largest pro-life gathering in the country after the one in Washington D.C., the group began marching down Market Street toward the Embarcadero. A handful of pro-choice counter-protesters stood alongside the largely peaceful walk. There were no official crowd estimates, but organizers said it was larger than in previous years, filling several blocks of Market Street at a time.\nCharter buses brought people from throughout the state, including dozens of students from Thomas Aquinas College, in Ventura County. More than 100 members of the Vietnamese Martyrs Parish in Sacramento made the trip to the Bay Area, most of them in two large charter buses, according to organizer Dzung Hoang.\n\u201cWe feel energized now that big government, especially the president, is listening,\u201d Hoang said.\nAbout 50 people came for the St. Lawrence the Martyr Parish in San Jose for the march, including Tim Crews, president of the San Jose chapter of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious we have a position on this and we see things moving in the direction we would like to see, which is putting an end to legal abortion,\u201d Crews said.\nHe was surprised over how big the turnout was, with attendees covering large swaths of the plaza.\n\u201cThis is a much more peaceful one than we had a number of years ago,\u201d he said, adding that previous marches had more aggressive confrontations with pro-choice activists.\nDolores Meehan, co-founder of Walk for Life West Coast, said she\u2019s been happily surprised with how much Trump has focused on pro-life causes \u2014 she didn\u2019t vote for him in 2016 because she didn\u2019t think he would follow through on the issue. Now, she says, there\u2019s momentum going into the 2020 elections, after which activists anticipate one or more Supreme Court seats could become vacant.\n\u201cI think that the issue is finally coming to a head and I think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Meehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious issue, it should make people upset.\u201d\nIn 2014, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care required all health insurers in the state to cover elective abortions in all their plans. That led to a pair of complaints and, on Friday, a notice of violation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.\nCalifornia\u2019s requirement violated the Weldon Amendment, according to the federal department\u2019s civil rights office. That amendment, in part, bars states receiving federal funding from requiring that health care plans pay for abortions. The state has 30 days to address the notice, or risk losing federal funding.\n\u201cWe are putting California on notice that it must stop forcing people of goodwill to subsidize the taking of human life, not only because it\u2019s the moral thing to do, but because it\u2019s the law,\u201d Roger Severino, director of the civil rights office, said in a statement on Friday.\nCalifornia\u2019s strong pro-abortion stance in the past might have served as a business advantage, according to Lisa Hammann, co-founder and chief executive officer of Rhia Ventures. The first invests in startups working on contraceptives and reproductive health.\nAccording to the study, 61 percent of women would hesitate taking a job based in a state that has tried to restrict access to abortion. Hammann said she encourages businesses to make sure their insurance covers reproductive health treatments including abortions, and to be vocal about the issue if they want to be competitive in their hiring.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a should, it\u2019s a, why wouldn\u2019t you? Women make up half of the workforce in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the fight for talent, you want to make sure your company is in a state women want to move to.\u201d\nBy age 45, according to the study, 99 percent of women have used contraceptives and a quarter of have had an abortion.\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReport an error\nPolicies and Standards\nContact Us\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularDear Abby: If your house is on fire, you get a pass.
