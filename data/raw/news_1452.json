    "description": "With measures to protect abortion access becoming law in two states, a ban in a third state and court action elsewhere, the status of abortion law in the U.S. remains unsettled. The issue has been a priority for state lawmakers and governors across the country. This week, North Dakota's governor signed a new ban into law, the governors of Minnesota and Washington signed bills to protect access and lawmakers in Nebraska and South Carolina fell just short of passing bans. A court hearing in Utah could help determine whether a ban on abortion clinics there is allowed to take effect.",

Wade and a nationwide right to abortion, states are pushing in opposite directions on the issue.This week, one state adopted a ban, two states tried to but didn\u2019t get support from enough lawmakers and three states advanced measures to protect abortion access. These are the latest developments among a slew of legislative and court actions on abortion.Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:BANNING ABORTIONNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday signed a law that made his state the 14th with a ban in effect on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.The ban has narrow exceptions. Abortions of pregnancies caused by rape or incest are allowed only in the first six weeks. And they\u2019re allowed later only for specific medical emergencies.The practical impact in the state is expected to be small since there have been no abortion clinics there since one moved last year from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota.\n\nAnd the ban is expected to face a court challenge, just like the one that it replaced, which was put on hold by a court last year.___FALLING SHORTTwo conservative states tried and narrowly failed to adopt abortion bans on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and why is he running for president?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota United end seven-game winless streak against LAFC, win 2-0 behind Eric Ramsay\u2019s debut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-hander Jake Odorizzi signs minor league deal to rejoin Tampa Bay Rays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nebraska, the unicameral legislature came one vote short of breaking a filibuster to enable a vote on setting a ban on abortions after cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 around six weeks into pregnancy and often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conservative South Carolina, the five women in the Senate, including three Republicans who describe themselves as \u201cpro-life,\u201d also filibustered against a bill that had already passed the House and would have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Six Republicans helped defeat the effort in a 22-21 vote to shelve the bill for the rest of the year.The state Senate has previously passed a ban after cardiac activity can be detected.South Carolina has become a major destination for abortions for women in Southern states with bans in place.\n\nThe state Supreme Court last year blocked enforcement of a ban after cardiac activity last year and then struck it down permanently in January. But a change in the makeup of the court has anti-abortion groups optimistic that a ban could stick if lawmakers could agree on how restrictive it should be.___ABORTION PILL ACCESSBoth chambers of Vermont\u2019s legislature passed bills on Thursday to protect access to abortion and gender-affirming care, moves echoing those made in other liberal states recently.But the Vermont legislation has a new wrinkle: It includes keeping legal \u201cmedication that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for termination of a pregnancy as of January 1, 2023, regardless of the medication\u2019s current FDA approval status.\u201dThat\u2019s a reference to another continuing saga over the legal status of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in a regimen that\u2019s the most common way to obtain an abortion in the U.S. A federal judge in Texas ruled in April that its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000 should be reversed. The U.S. Supreme Court this month said it will be kept legal for now. The next step in the case is arguments before the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit on May 17.\n\nAdvocates of the Vermont law say that if the approval is pulled, it would still be available in the state under its law, so long as Republican Gov. Phil Scott signs it.___ADDING PROTECTIONSAt least 19 states have adopted laws or executive orders since last year protecting access to abortion, largely through measures aimed at protecting out-of-state patients, medical providers and other helpers from investigations by states where abortion is banned.In a growing number of states, those laws apply both to those who seek abortion and gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers and hormone treatment for transgender people.On Thursday, the Democratic governors of Minnesota and Washington state signed such laws.Minnesota shares borders with three states that have abortion bans, including North Dakota now that a ban is in place.\n\nWashington\u2019s neighbor is Idaho, where a law signed this month made it illegal for an adult to help a minor get an abortion without parental consent.___SOFTENING RESTRICTIONS - A BITTennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Friday signed a law to soften the state\u2019s strict abortion ban a bit.The Republican had previously said it did not need changes.The revised law still does not include exceptions in the cases of rape or incest but does allow doctors to use \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d when determining an abortion is necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant patient or to prevent irreversible, severe impairment of a major bodily function. Lawmakers also clarified that doctors may provide abortion services for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages.___NEW RESTRICTIONS IN A DIVIDED STATEIn Kansas, Republican lawmakers continue to push for restrictions even after voters last year decisively affirmed abortion rights.\n\nUnder laws adopted this week in Kansas with overrides of vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, health care providers could face criminal charges over accusations about their care of newborns delivered during certain abortion procedures. The state is to provide $2 million to centers run by abortion opponents. Clinics would also be required to tell patients that medication abortions can be stopped using a drug regimen.Medical providers say the reversal procedure is ineffective and potentially dangerous and babies born during abortions are very rare.With these policies, too, the divisions run deep: The neighboring state of Colorado has a ban on treatments to reverse medication abortions. On Friday, a federal judge there said he would not block the state from enforcing it. The state has said it doesn\u2019t plan to anyway until regulators develop rules.In another new restriction, Montana\u2019s health department said that beginning Monday, it will require documentation that an abortion is \u201cmedically necessary\u201d before the state\u2019s Medicaid health insurance program for lower-income people will pay for it.___IN COURTA court has blocked an abortion ban from being enforced in Utah, but lawmakers there are trying another novel approach to reduce availability of abortions provided: banning clinics that provide them.Under the law signed in March, clinics will no longer be able to apply for licenses as of May 3. The Planned Parenthood Association of Utah says that absent intervention, it will shut down its three clinics in the state on May 3.A judge on Friday said he would rule on the ban next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Geoff Mulvihill\n            \n\n                Covering state government issues nationally\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
