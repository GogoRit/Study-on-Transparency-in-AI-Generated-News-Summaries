(AP) \u2014 Newly filed legislation allowing illegal abortions to be prosecuted as homicides drew a quick pushback Wednesday from the state\u2019s anti-abortion attorney general, who warned it would wrongly subject Kentucky women to charges for terminating pregnancies.\nRepublican state Rep. Emily Callaway raised the stakes in the state\u2019s bitter abortion debates when she introduced the measure Tuesday in a state where most abortions are currently banned.\nThe freshman lawmaker\u2019s proposal would subject illegal abortions to the \u201csame legal principles as would apply to the homicide of a person who had been born alive.\u201d The bill would expand the definition of a human being to include an \u201cunborn child.\u201d\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican who is running for governor, responded Wednesday that the bill \u201cstrikes the wrong balance\u201d and urged the GOP-led legislature to reject it.\n\u201cIf adopted by the General Assembly, this bill would allow pregnant mothers who have an abortion to be criminally charged and prosecuted with homicide,\u201d Cameron said in a statement from his office that also touted his anti-abortion credentials.\nSo far, the highly charged abortion issue has mostly been on the back burner in this year\u2019s legislative session in the Bluegrass State. Lawmakers are awaiting a ruling by Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court in a case revolving around the constitutionality of the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\nWATCH: The shifting battle over abortion rights 50 years after Roe\nThe state\u2019s trigger law outlawing nearly all abortions is being challenged. It took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Kentucky law carved out narrow exceptions to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life or prevent disabling injury.\nKentucky\u2019s Republican House speaker, David Osborne, said Wednesday that he anticipates other abortion-related legislation being introduced in the coming days, including proposals that would provide further exceptions when abortion would be legal.\nOsborne gave a chilly response to Callaway\u2019s proposal to prosecute abortions as homicides. He said Kentucky lawmakers have \u201cnever passed a \u2018pro-life\u2019 measure that did not take into consideration the necessity for any exceptions, nor has this House majority caucus ever contemplated doing so.\u201d\nRepublicans have supermajorities in both the Kentucky House and Senate.\nThe state\u2019s trigger law targets doctors for prosecution for providing abortions in violation of state law, but pregnant women who receive abortions are not subject to prosecution. But the new bill introduced by Callaway did not appear to make exceptions for pregnant people.\nHer bill would exempt abortions necessary to prevent a pregnant woman\u2019s death. It includes other exceptions for a \u201cspontaneous miscarriage;\u201d or for abortions provided only after \u201call reasonable alternatives to save the life of the unborn child are unavailable or were attempted unsuccessfully.\u201d\nThe measure would give the attorney general\u2019s office concurrent jurisdiction along with local prosecutors in prosecuting illegal abortions as homicides.\nCameron, in the midst of this year\u2019s hotly contested GOP primary campaign for governor, immediately distanced himself from the proposal.\n\u201cWhile I strongly support prohibiting abortions in Kentucky, I just as strongly support helping pregnant women,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cPregnant mothers deserve our help, support and life-affirming options, not to face criminal charges.\u201d\nCameron\u2019s office has defended the trigger law and a separate six-week state abortion ban in legal challenges that reached the state\u2019s highest court.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Debbie Jeffreys of Metairie, Louisiana, holds a sign during nationwide demonstrations following the leaked Supreme Court opinion suggesting the possibility of overturning the Roe v.
