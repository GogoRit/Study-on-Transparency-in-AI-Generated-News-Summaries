    "description": "The South Carolina Senate is no closer to passing a near-total abortion ban than the last time they shot down the proposal. A 22-21 vote Thursday marks the third time a near-total abortion ban has failed to pass the Republican-led chamber since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade last summer. The chamber\u2019s five women filibustered the proposal in speeches highlighting the Senate\u2019s male majority. The result maintains a legislative stalemate between the House and Senate over when to ban abortion. Majority Leader Shane Massey says the House must pass a different Senate bill if lawmakers have any shot at restricting abortion by the time the session ends on May 11.",

(AP) \u2014 South Carolina senators rejected a bill that would have banned nearly all abortions in a conservative state that has increasingly served patients across a region where Republican officials have otherwise curtailed access.A 22-21 vote Thursday marks the third time a near-total abortion ban has failed in the Republican-led chamber since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade last summer. Six Republicans helped block motions to end debate and defeated any chance the bill passes this year.The chamber\u2019s five women filibustered the proposal in speeches highlighting the Senate\u2019s male majority that they criticized for pushing debates on abortion over other pressing issues.Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson spent over 30 minutes Wednesday detailing the bodily changes throughout every stage of pregnancy. Gustafson said she spoke so long because the millions of women addressed in the bill had not been heard. She emphasized her \u201cpro-life\u201d position but said the proposal left \u201cno room for empathy, reality or graciousness.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Sandy Senn criticized Majority Leader Shane Massey for repeatedly \u201ctaking us off a cliff on abortion.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico authorities detain man in fatal shooting of state police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina approves $26M, 6-year contract extension for basketball coach Lamont Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray-Boyles scores 24 as No. 15 South Carolina beats Arkansas 80-66 at SEC Tourney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only thing that we can do when you all, you men in the chamber, metaphorically keep slapping women by raising abortion again and again and again, is for us to slap you back with our words,\u201d Senn said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill would have banned abortion at conception, with exceptions for rape or incest through the first trimester, fatal fetal anomalies confirmed by two physicians, and to save the patient\u2019s life or health. Independent Sen. Mia McLeod criticized leaders who prioritized the near-total ban over efforts to make South Carolina the 49th state in the country with a law allowing harsher punishments for violent hate crimes.McLeod, who shared during a previous abortion debate that she had been raped, said it is unfortunate that women must reveal intimate experiences to \u201cenlighten and engage\u201d men.\n\n\u201cJust as rape is about power and control, so is this total ban,\u201d McLeod said Thursday. \u201cThose who continue to push legislation like this are raping us again with their indifference, violating us again with their righteous indignation, taunting us again with their insatiable need to play God while they continue to pass laws that are ungodly.\u201dAbortion remains legal through 22 weeks in South Carolina \u2014 a status that has drawn patients throughout the increasingly restrictive Southeast.The number of abortions and out-of-state patients has risen since the South Carolina Supreme Court first enjoined and then struck down a 2021 law, according to provisional state health department data that could change.Supporters said the bill is necessary to curb those trends. Opponents said it would only prevent safe access to the procedure and worsen the state\u2019s already alarmingly high maternal death rates and even poorer outcomes for Black patients.The vote maintains the legislative stalemate made plain during a special session last year when the House and Senate failed to agree on when South Carolina should ban abortion. The Senate has again passed a different ban taking effect when cardiac activity is detected, as early as six weeks and before many people realize they are pregnant. \n\nThe developments have astounded the staunchest anti-abortion lawmakers in a General Assembly that previously led the way on regulations like a law requiring physicians to inform patients that they can see an ultrasound before the procedure.Republican Sen. Richard Cash began Wednesday\u2019s debate by expressing disappointment that a majority party that has long waved the \u201cpro-life\u201d banner would not pass a total abortion ban.\u201cI\u2019m not willing to sit by and let the goalposts be moved for what it means to be pro-life for the Republican Party,\u201d Cash said. Massey said Thursday\u2019s vote shows that the House must consider the Senate bill to give lawmakers a shot at passing new restrictions by the time session ends on May 11.House Speaker Murrell Smith would not commit to voting on the Senate bill but told reporters Wednesday that the House \u201cis always going to evaluate its options on protecting life.\u201d\n\nRepublican Gov. Henry McMaster on Wednesday urged lawmakers to pass a bill that \u201cthe vast majority of our state\u201d finds acceptable. He later clarified that he thinks most people supported a 2021 law banning abortion when cardiac activity is detected \u2014 which the state\u2019s highest court ruled unconstitutional, and which resembles the Senate version.\u2014-Associated Press writer Jeffrey Collins contributed to this report.
