    "text": "What to know about Oklahoma's new 6-week abortion ban lawNews Sports Life Opinion Business Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals  NEWSWhat we know, and what we don't, about Oklahoma's 6-week abortion banDana Branham Carmen FormanOklahomanAbortion access was drastically limited in Oklahoma this week when Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill that bans most abortions after roughly the sixth week of pregnancy.Restrictions may get even tighter soon, as the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled it\u2019s willing to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that upheld the right to abortion.\u00a0Related:What banning abortion means for Oklahoma doctors and pregnant patientsIf the court reverses Roe, abortion will immediately become outlawed in nearly all instances across Oklahoma because of a \u201ctrigger law\u201d Stitt signed in 2021.But for now, abortions are still legal in Oklahoma if they occur within the first six weeks of pregnancy, though that\u2019s before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\u00a0State data from 2017 through 2020 shows that the majority of abortions recorded in Oklahoma happen after six weeks\u2019 gestation. After the implementation of Senate Bill 1503, women\u00a0further along in their pregnancies may be pushed out of state to Kansas, New Mexico or Colorado to get an abortion.\u00a0Here\u2019s what we know \u2014 and what we don\u2019t \u2014 about how Oklahoma\u2019s restrictive new abortion law works and who it affects. SB 1503 took effect immediately Tuesday.What changed\u00a0compared to Oklahoma\u2019s previous laws on abortion?The state previously prohibited most abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization. Viability, or when a fetus can survive outside the womb, is typically 24 weeks or later.\u00a0\u00a0Under the new law, abortion will effectively be banned after a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is detected. Although that term is a misnomer, abortion clinics will stop providing the procedure after about the sixth week of pregnancy.\u00a0Related:'It's horrible.' Uncertainty looms as Oklahoma clinic braces for Texas-style abortion banAbortion providers and reproductive rights groups have asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to block the new law.\u00a0The court declined to issue a temporary injunction that would have immediately halted implementation of SB 1503, but the court is still considering the broader legal challenge.\u00a0Despite lawsuits, Texas\u2019 Senate Bill 8, which SB 1503 copies, is still in place after taking effect in September. That could be a sign that challenging Oklahoma\u2019s civil enforcement law could be an uphill fight.\u00a0If the U.S. Supreme Court reverses Roe and allows states to set abortion policy, legal challenges against SB 1503 may become moot.\u00a0Who can sue and be sued under Oklahoma's abortion law?Anyone who \u201cknowingly engages\u201d in conduct that \u201caids or abets\u201d a woman seeking an abortion after a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is detected could face a civil lawsuit. The law includes little detail about what counts as aiding or abetting.\u00a0But the law is written in such a way that someone could be sued even if they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re breaking the law by helping a woman.\u00a0Women seeking an abortion could not be sued.\u00a0In what appears to be protections for taxi, Uber and Lyft drivers, the law stipulates a person who takes a pregnant woman to a provider cannot be sued if said person is unaware the woman intends to get an abortion.\u00a0A person could not face multiple lawsuits for one instance of helping a woman get an illegal abortion.\u00a0Almost any private citizen could file a lawsuit in accordance with SB 1503.\u00a0Because the law was intentionally written so the state wouldn\u2019t have to enforce it, the state and all political subdivisions are barred from filing lawsuits. As are officers or employees of state or local government entities.\u00a0The law expressly prohibits someone who impregnated a woman through rape or incest from bringing a lawsuit against their victim.\u00a0Successful plaintiffs could be awarded at least $10,000 in damages.Could Oklahomans be sued for donating to a fund that helps women seek out an abortion?The law is murky on this point. SB 1503 expressly prohibits \u201cpaying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion through insurance or otherwise.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear if that prohibition could apply to an Oklahoman who helps pay for a woman to seek an abortion out of state. It\u2019s also unclear if Oklahomans who donate to entities like the Roe Fund, which provides financial assistance to women seeking abortions, could be subject to a civil lawsuit.\u00a0In Texas, anti-abortion lawyers are pushing to get information about those who donated to two abortion funds with the aim of suing those individuals for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d illegal abortions.Someone could bring a lawsuit anytime in the six years following a woman\u2019s illegal abortion.\u00a0The law is not retroactive, and does not extend to abortions that occurred before the law took effect.What does the abortion law say about determining whether an embryo has a 'fetal heartbeat'?The law says a physician cannot \u201cknowingly perform\u201d an abortion if they detect a \u201cfetal heartbeat,\u201d which is defined in the act as cardiac activity or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart.The law also prevents doctors from performing an abortion without first testing for a \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201dOklahoma law requires providers to perform an ultrasound before an abortion. At six weeks, the embryo has not developed chambers of the heart, so it\u2019s inaccurate to call any cardiac activity a \u201cheartbeat.\u201d But an ultrasound machine may translate electronic impulses from cardiac activity in very early pregnancy into sounds that resemble a heartbeat.\u00a0Does this abortion law\u00a0apply to Oklahoma residents who travel to other states for the procedure?\u00a0Looking to Texas\u2019 SB 8, the law after which Oklahoma\u2019s new ban was modeled, the law wouldn\u2019t apply to those who travel out of state to get an abortion where it is legal.\u00a0Under SB 1503, people can bring lawsuits against those who perform an abortion, or those who \u201caid or abet\u201d someone in getting an abortion. But the person receiving an abortion couldn\u2019t be sued.\u00a0Still, it\u2019s murky. Since the law will push enforcement of the ban to civil courts, it\u2019s impossible to rule out that someone won\u2019t try to sue an abortion provider or someone who assists an Oklahoman in accessing an abortion out of state.\u00a0Ultimately, the courts would have to determine whether\u00a0such a lawsuit could proceed.Does this law apply to medication abortions?Senate Bill 1503 applies to both procedural and medication abortions after a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is detected. Medication abortions involve taking a series of pills over a few days and can be performed up to 10 weeks into a woman\u2019s pregnancy.\u00a0A procedural abortion is done in a clinic over a few hours.Access to emergency contraception, sometimes called \u201cPlan B\u201d or the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill, isn\u2019t affected by this law.\u00a0Emergency contraception doesn\u2019t induce an abortion or terminate a pregnancy; the pill works by temporarily delaying ovulation and preventing fertilization. It\u2019s meant to be taken up to three to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy, but is most effective the sooner you take it.\u00a0What exceptions to the new abortion law exist?\u00a0SB 1503 makes an exception allowing doctors to perform abortions later than six weeks in the event of a medical emergency.\u00a0There is no exception for later abortions in the event of rape or incest.When asked about the \"medical emergency\" exception in another Oklahoma abortion ban that will go into effect in August \u2014 which would make performing an abortion a felony \u2014 Stitt said it will be up to doctors to make that call.\u00a0But this is a gray area, Oklahoma doctors have said. The law doesn\u2019t define what counts as a medical emergency or lay out specific circumstances when an abortion can be performed to protect the mother\u2019s life or health.That could leave doctors vulnerable to legal trouble if someone determined they intervened inappropriately, one Oklahoma OB-GYN said.Under SB1503, physicians would be required to include in a woman\u2019s medical records notes on why they felt an abortion was a medical necessity.Oklahoma law doesn\u2019t allow for medication abortion pills to be prescribed through telehealth visits \u2014 a physician has to be physically present to prescribe them.The state also passed two laws in 2021 that would place several restrictions on medication abortions, including prohibiting shipments of the pills directly to Oklahomans by mail. The Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked the implementation of those laws\u00a0in October\u00a0by granting a temporary injunction while a legal challenge is ongoing.What resources exist for someone who wants an abortion?Planned Parenthood and Trust Women both operate clinics in Oklahoma that provide abortions allowed under state law. Planned Parenthood also has staff outside of Oklahoma who can help walk a person through their legal abortion options.\u00a0ineedana.com can help direct people who want an abortion to the clinic nearest to them, based on how far along their pregnancy is and abortion laws in their area.\u00a0The Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline is staffed by clinicians who give advice on self-managing a miscarriage or abortion. It\u2019s available by phone or text at 833-246-2632.Abortion terms to knowWhen someone is six weeks pregnant, that means six weeks have passed since their last menstrual period. That could mean a person\u2019s period could be about two weeks late, if they have regular monthly periods.\u00a0Doctors calculate how many weeks pregnant a person is based on when their last period was. That\u2019s a consistent way of dating a pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), because it eliminates variability in determining when during the menstrual cycle a person ovulates.\u00a0Experts use various terms for a developing baby during pregnancy. From eight weeks since a pregnant person\u2019s last menstrual period, it\u2019s called an embryo. From then on, until delivery, it\u2019s called a fetus, according to the ACOG.Legislation to restrict abortions may often refer to a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d in determining a cutoff point for access to the procedures, but at the six-week mark, an embryo hasn\u2019t developed chambers of the heart yet, so there is no recognizable \u201cheartbeat\u201d at that point.In very early pregnancy, \u201cwhat pregnant people may hear is the ultrasound machine translating electronic impulses that signify fetal cardiac activity into sound\u201d we may recognize as a heartbeat, the ACOG explains on its website.\u00a0Until the chambers of the heart have been developed, typically about 17 to 20 weeks, it\u2019s inaccurate to call an embryo or fetus\u2019 cardiac development a \u201cheartbeat,\u201d according to the ACOG.\u00a0There are multiple types of abortion procedures. Medication abortions are one kind, and in 2020, they made up about 65% of the 3,797 abortions recorded in Oklahoma.\u00a0In a medication abortion, a person takes a drug called mifepristone along with another medication called misoprostol about 24-48 hours later to end a pregnancy within about 10 weeks\u2019 gestation or less.Some abortions can also be performed in a clinic. These might sometimes be referred to as \u201csurgical abortions,\u201d but these types of procedures aren\u2019t surgery because they don\u2019t involve an incision. They\u2019re more accurately called procedural abortions or in-clinic abortions.\u00a0Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.oklahoman.com.
