The woman held a sign with a familiar phrase to those of us fighting for reproductive freedom: \u201cMy Body, My Choice.\u201d\nBut displayed prominently alongside the line was a crossed-out face mask, the kind that medical experts, state and local officials, and even members of the Trump administration (no thanks to President Trump himself) have resoundingly said should be worn in public to protect our communities against the spread of the coronavirus.\nConservatives\u2019 efforts to co-opt the symbols and language of other movements, often movements they directly oppose, are part of their standard operating procedure. And of course, conservative media jumped right onto the disinformation bandwagon\u2014as they so often do\u2014to push the same faulty message.\nIt was to be expected. Absent any rational way to justify their actions, the GOP and the radical right simply use a combination of deflection and disinformation to advance their agenda. A core part of that has always been the co-opting of messages and symbols of social justice movements.\nLook no further than the Trump administration for proof. The president\u2019s economic adviser, Stephen Moore,\u00a0disingenuously framed defying protections meant to safeguard the health and safety of our communities as necessary \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d akin to the civil rights movement.\n\u201cWe need to be the Rosa Parks here and protest against these government injustices,\u201d Moore said about protesters defying these necessary public health protections. Never mind\u00a0that, across the country, these protesters waved around Confederate flags and signs with swastikas.\nIn truth, Moore and the protesters are simply trying to advance their own agenda using strategies right out of the anti-choice movement\u2019s propaganda playbook, without thought to the women and families who will be forced to pay the price.\nWe\u2019ve seen this tactic play out time and time again as the radical right attacks reproductive freedom by deploying dishonest propaganda campaigns that rely on co-opted imagery and phrases from those who seek greater equality and justice. These bad actors weaponize disinformation every chance they get in order to push their ideology and advance their dangerous agenda\u2014no matter the costs.\nThe anti-choice movement, for example, has long recognized that its long-term goal of banning abortion is unpopular with the vast majority of Americans, and so they attempt to couch their rhetoric in language they think will appeal to persuadable people or those not firmly affiliated with either political party. Here, it\u2019s critical to understand that they\u2019re not moderating their tone to make it more agreeable\u2014they\u2019re parroting ours because they know it works better.\nNARAL\u2019s opposition research team documented how this tactic was deployed during this year\u2019s annual anti-choice March for Life rally, which was themed \u201cPro-Life is Pro-Woman\u201d in an attempt to co-opt feminism. And the language of the civil rights movement is similarly\u00a0parroted by activists hostile to abortion rights to claim that abortion, rather than anti-choice laws, is discriminatory.\nThis tactic of parroting the rhetoric of social justice movements is coincidently a specialty of White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, who spent decades developing messaging for the anti-choice movement and its allied politicians. It was a key component of her efforts to rebrand the Republican Party as \u201cpro-woman\u201d using medical disinformation and junk science\u2014parroting reproductive freedom supporters\u2019 strategy of heavy reliance on fact and science\u2014all in an effort to make anti-choice positions seem more popular than they really were.\nBut what all of these anti-choice propaganda campaigns are trying to cover up is that 7 in 10 people in this country support reproductive freedom, and bans on abortion are unpopular in every state.\nWithin the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it should come as no surprise that we are seeing out-of-touch conservatives wield this same tactic to continue to advance their harmful agenda, seemingly without any hesitation, even in the midst of a public health crisis.\nOnly a small but vocal minority support ending the critical precautions that these conservatives are rallying against. A recent NBC News/WSJ poll found that \u201c58 percent of registered voters say that what worries them more [than the economy] is that the U.S. will move too quickly to loosen stay-at-home restrictions, resulting in the coronavirus\u2019 spreading and more lives being lost.\u201d\nThe public simply isn\u2019t on their side, and they\u2019re seeking a way to deflect from their unpopular agenda.\nBut here, even more was at play as the right co-opted\u00a0a pro-choice mantra to protest stay-at-home orders put in place by state officials to help protect the health and safety of all Americans. I would be remiss not to also point to the blatant hypocrisy afoot.\nI reject the notion pushed by the anti-choice movement that \u201cour body, our choice\u201d is invalid because it is \u201cnot just your body.\u201d But in using the message here to protest efforts to protect our collective health and well-being, they are exposing themselves and simultaneously jeopardizing literally thousands of lives. They simply don\u2019t care.\nIt\u2019s something that Jennifer Rubin recently explained in the Washington Post. The radical right\u2019s willingness to exploit the pandemic at the expense of women and families, she said, has meant they \u201chave squandered any argument that they care about human life.\u201d\nActions speak volumes. And in this moment, most of the \u201cpro-life\u201d crowd has shown themselves to be anything but.\nThe strategy at play here by the radical right is plain to see: deploy a sinister brew of distraction, disinformation, and deflection to divert attention from the president\u2019s complete bungling of the pandemic response and make their unpopular agenda seem more palatable\u2014even if it puts lives at risk.\nThe co-option of the symbols and messaging of people and movements they oppose runs through these tactics like clockwork. Like they so often do, conservatives are pulling out all of the stops to make us look the other way while they advance\u00a0their ideology.\nDuring this unprecedented public health crisis, we must all be focused on our communities\u2019 health and safety. It has never been more important to make sure we all turn to facts\u2014and just as we cannot let anti-choice disinformation about time-sensitive essential care for women go unchallenged, so too must we recognize conservatives\u2019 attempts to push their dangerous agenda at all costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday'sPopular Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n \n\nEmail Sign-Up\n\n\n\n\nInterests \n\nEvents\n\nInformation\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\nFundraising Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nContact Us\n\n \n\u00a9 2024 Rewire News Group.
