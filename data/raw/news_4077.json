But the full toll of this catastrophe has been incalculably greater. Health systems have been overwhelmed. Economies have been shuttered. And women and girls have been disproportionately affected, with sexual and reproductive health services being curtailed and gender-based violence on the rise.\nToday, 11 July, is World Population Day, a moment to raise awareness of the sexual and reproductive health needs of people around the world.\u00a0 This year, UNFPA is calling attention to the needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls amid the global pandemic, and the efforts needed to secure their health and human rights.\n\u201cNo organization or country can do this alone,\u201d said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA\u2019s Executive Director, in a statement.\u00a0Heightened risks to women\nAround the world, women face a variety of heightened risks due to the pandemic.\nFront-line health workers \u2013 the majority of whom are women \u2013 face a direct risk of illness from COVID-19, for instance.\nBut women and girls outside the health sector face serious risks, too. Those requiring sexual and reproductive health services may face anxiety about exposure to the virus while seeking care \u2013 or they may forgo care entirely. Others have lost access to care all together due to movement restrictions and curbed health services.\nMany hospitals and health centres are reporting declines in the number of women and girls receiving critical sexual and reproductive health care, including antenatal services, safe delivery services and family planning.\nUNFPA and partners estimate that six months of significant health service disruptions could result in 47 million women in low- and middle-income countries going without contraceptives, leading to an additional 7 million unintended pregnancies. The number of maternal deaths is also expected to increase.\nUNFPA is working to ensure continued access to reproductive health services and supplies.\nIn the Gambia, for instance, where the pandemic has reduced the number of women seeking health care, UNFPA is providing protective gear to health workers, improving community-level communications about the disease, and ensuring the continuation of family planning and midwifery programmes.\nFatou Joof, a midwife at the UNFPA-supported Serrekunda Health Centre outside Banjul, expressed relief that she is able to continue providing maternal health care while using protective measures including face masks.\n\"When the women come to the facility, we make sure they wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water. We also make hand sanitizers available for use,\" she said.\n\u201cThe work I do here brings me so much joy. This is who we are as midwives and this is what we do \u2013 we save lives.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic threatens women's access to reproductive health care, including family planning services, antenatal care and safe delivery services.\nHumanitarian settings\nCircumstances are even more harrowing in humanitarian settings.\nIn Venezuela, shipments of medical supplies have been necessary to bolster the health system, which was already in crisis before the pandemic erupted.\nHumanitarian support was also essential for 19-year-old Afra Muhammad, in Syria, who faced life-threatening pregnancy complications in the Rukban displacement camp.\nUNFPA and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent arranged emergency transport for her \u2013 a process that took two weeks of planning and two more weeks of travel. Finally, Afra arrived at the Family Planning Hospital in Homs, where she delivered a daughter via Caesarean section. \u00a0\nThough she is relieved to have had a safe delivery, she remains fearful about COVID-19. \u201cI am so worried about my baby, and especially during the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d she told UNFPA.\nElsewhere in Syria, women are reporting heightened levels of gender-based violence \u2013 echoing a phenomenon seen globally.\n\u201cDuring the curfew period, I have met a lot of women who face violence by their husbands,\u201d said Ghadeer Mohammed Ibrahim Qara Bulad, director of the Women\u2019s Development Project at the Islamic Charitable Association.\n\nDigital platforms have become a way to reach vulnerable women with support, counselling and services responding to gender-based violence.\nGender-based violence\nRising household tensions, exacerbated by economic pressures and movement restrictions, are sparking violence around the world. Women sheltering at home with their abusers often have nowhere to turn. And new forms of violence may be increasing, including cyber violence.\n\u201cOn social media, there is a lot of bullying and violence directed at women in the light of the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Ms. Bulad told UNFPA.\nUNFPA estimates that six months of lockdowns could lead to 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence, and an additional 15 million more cases for every three months the lockdown continues.\nTo make matters worse, access to shelters and in-person counselling has been limited by the pandemic. UNFPA and partners are working to continue services for survivors wherever possible, and to increase remote operations.\nBut even this can be fraught.\nIn Ukraine, experts say phone-based services are not enough. \u201cA phone call to the hotline itself can prompt partner aggression,\u201d said Alona Krivuliak, who runs a domestic violence hotline supported by UNFPA.\nCounsellors are finding new ways of working, including through silent platforms such as Viber and Facebook Messenger. \u201cNow some clients even tell us that this way of work is more suitable for them than visiting us, and they want to continue in such way even after quarantine ends,\u201d psychologist Tetyana Franchuk said.\nUNFPA programmes are also engaging men in the promotion of gender equality.\nThe world must redouble all such efforts, Dr. Kanem said: \u201cAs the global community comes together in solidarity to survive this pandemic, we lay the foundation for more resilient, gender-equal societies and a healthier, more prosperous future for all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nEquality for All 8 Billion People: World Population Day 2023\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories\n\nThree women making the world safer for women\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories\n\nLighting the way for women and girls\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
