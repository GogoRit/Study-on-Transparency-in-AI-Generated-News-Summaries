Toni will serve as the new Minority Outreach and Healthy Relationships Director. Students for Life has worked with Toni often over the years, but bringing her formally onto our team allows for an even deeper partnership that is sure to benefit the Pro-Life Generation.\nAbout Toni\nIn her own words\u2026\nI am an international speaker on the topic of abortion and healthy relationships. I am the founder of the program Relationships Matter which seeks to educate the youth on the degradation of sex in our culture while equipping them to walk out healthy relationships to not only protect themselves but honor their spouse in the future.\nI know the power of overcoming my own past and setting a new foundation for myself. In my presentation, I will help you handle forgiveness, receive redemption, and look mistakes in the face without allowing them to hold you\u00a0back. My\u00a0goal is to educate and expose the lies of abortion by sharing my own personal story of having an abortion myself.\nI am a graduate of West Chester University. I have a masters in professional counseling from Clark\u2019s Summit University and I am currently pursuing my licensure. I have been married to my wonderful husband for 11 years! We have been blessed with 4 beautiful children.\nSome of Toni\u2019s Work with SFLA\nThis year, Toni was a part of Students for Life\u2019s ambitious new video series, #Why. This series set out to talk to the pro-life movement\u2019s most renowned experts about the biggest questions our movement faces. In Toni\u2019s #Why video, she discusses why abortion kills so many more black babies than white babies.
