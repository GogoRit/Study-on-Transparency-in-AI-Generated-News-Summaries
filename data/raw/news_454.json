Groups of hooligans tried to disrupt the event.https://p.dw.com/p/3kepFImage: Krzysztof Kaniewski/ZUMA Wire/picture-allianceAdvertisementTens of thousands of protesters took part in demonstrations in Warsaw and other cities across Poland on Friday. Protests have been raging across the Catholic country every day since last Thursday, when the Constitutional Tribunal outlawed abortion in cases of fetal congenital defects \u2014 the most common reason for the 1,110 legal abortions recorded by the Polish Health Ministry last year.\u00a0\nIn the capital, mostly young demonstrators gathered in front of the headquarters of the government, the ruling party and at one of the city's main squares, before converging in the city center. At the same time, groups of football hooligans fired flares at the crowd in Warsaw. Police said they confiscated flares, gas containers and batons.\nMarta Lempart, co-founder of Women's Strike, a non-governmental organization (NGO) and a main demonstration organizer, said:\u00a0\"We're prepared to fight till the end.\"\nLempart said her group's main goal is to force the resignation of the government. Women's Strike also wants the Constitutional Tribunal's ruling declared invalid due to what is perceived as the court's fealty to the executive branch.\nRead more:\u00a0Opinion: Abortion ruling is a nightmare for Polish women#CzarnyProtest: Polish women stand up against anti-abortion lawTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nCan protests take place amid coronavirus restrictions?\nThe government has made clear it does not want protesters on the streets, ostensibly for health reasons. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki used Facebook to call on citizens to stay home amid the current spike in new coronavirus infections. Poland reported\u00a0a record 21,000 new infections on Friday.\u00a0\n\"Let us not allow irresponsible behavior from some to harm the elderly, the weakest and the public services engaged in combatting the pandemic,\"\u00a0Morawiecki said.\nLast week, the government implemented a ban on gatherings of more than five people due to coronavirus. Poland's justice minister has insisted he will press criminal charges against protest organizers for \"causing an epidemiological threat.\"\nIf found guilty, persons could be jailed for up to eight years.\u00a0\n\"If one of us is attacked by the oppressive system of Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, he will have to deal with all of us,\" said a defiant Klementyna Suchanow of Women's Strike. Organizers have asked protesters to wear masks and keep as much distance between themselves as possible.\u00a0\nDW\u00a0Warsaw correspondent\u00a0Olivia Kortas says, demonstrators \"do wear masks but obviously\u00a0these are\u00a0huge protests and people are close to each other.\"\u00a0\n\"We are doing nothing wrong by protesting and going out on the streets,\" said Women's Strike co-founder Marta Lempart.\nHow long will protests continue?\nThe government has labeled protesters \u2014 some of whom have also disrupted Catholic masses, verbally abused priests and graffitied churches \u2014 \"barbarians,\" \"vandals\" and \"left-wing fascists.\"\n\u00a0\nPiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski has been especially sharp in his criticism of the protests and called on his base to \"defend Polish churches at any price,\" echoing calls from far-right groups. \u00a0\nPrior days have seen violence between protesters and far-right groups, so security is expected to be tight Friday. The mostly peaceful demonstrations have voiced outrage at the nationalist\u2002PiS party, with protesters blaming it and the Roman Catholic Church for the ruling.\nOn Thursday, demonstrations across the country drew an estimated 400,000 participants. Protests are expected to continue next week.'Are you going to murder your baby?'To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhat is the legal situation regarding abortion?\nPoland already has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe and protesters say the high court's ruling amounts to a near total ban. Once the law goes on the books, abortion will only be legal in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger.\nThe ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) says the court decision will stop \"eugenic abortions\" but critics and rights group say it will force women to endure non-viable pregnancies.\u00a0\nThe PiS government previously attempted to tighten abortion laws in 2016 and 2017 but was met with massive street protests each time.\u00a0\njs/rt (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)\n\nSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisementSkip next section Related topicsRelated topicsWarsawAbortionSexuality educationPolandAbout DWWho we arePressDW Global Media ForumDW offersLearn GermanDW AkademieServiceNewslettersReceptionFAQContactTopics from A to ZHeadlinesB2BSales & DistributionTravelAdvertisingGerman News ServiceFollow us on\u00a9 2024 Deutsche WellePrivacy PolicyLegal noticeDigital accessibilityData privacy settings\n\n\n"
