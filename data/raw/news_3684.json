A new Dr. Phil installment centering on abortion and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade saw a pro-life advocate clash with the show\u2019s host and an audience member during several tense exchanges on Monday.\u00a0    In the first episode of Dr. Phil\u2019s 21st season, pro-life activist Lila Rose sat down with the doctor, as well as a pro-choice couple to discuss various facets of the abortion issue, including the question of when life begins.\u00a0Dr. Phil said nobody on the panel is \"pro-death\" or \"pro-abortion,\" instead labeling the divide over abortion as a disagreement between those who are \"pro-choice,\" and those who are \"pro-life.\" He then turned to Rose and claimed there is no \"consensus\" among the scientific community about when life forms.\u00a0  \"There is Dr. Phil, 96% of scientists say that begins at fertilization--,\" Rose said as Dr. Phil began to talk over her.  ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST BLASTS DC AUTHORITIES FOR TAKING NO ACTION ON POSSIBLE ILLEGAL ABORTIONS  Dr. Phil McGraw, television personality and psychologist, talks about cyber-bullying during a hearing of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor, on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 24, 2010. \u00a0REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (Reuters)  \"No, actually there\u2019s not--,\" Dr. Phil quickly replied as Rose continued her point.\u00a0\"If you\u2019re an in-vitro specialist you\u2019re looking to create a single cell embryo, then you know you have a human life, so it is a scientific fact,\" Rose added, as Dr. Phil continued the crosstalk, asking her to let him finish.\u00a0  Dr. Phil then again asserted there is no scientific consensus. Rose asked the host when he believes life begins. Dr. Phil replied that it didn\u2019t matter what he believed, calling her claim about scientific consensus \"not true.\" Rose called his position \"simply inaccurate.\"The host opened up a booklet where he noted that some neuroscientists purport that life begins when there is a detectable brain wave.\u00a0  \"In an abortion if it\u2019s not a human life why do you have to kill it?\" Rose interjected.\u00a0    RAISING PRO-LIFE KIDS IN A PRO-CHOICE CULTURE IN AMERICA: 'IT ALL BEGINS IN THE HOME,' SAY ACTIVISTS  Dr. Phil McGraw issued a mea culpa to Slippery Rock University when discussing the nationwide college admissions scandal. (Getty)\"I haven\u2019t spoken over you, and you keep speaking over me and I assume that\u2019s because you don\u2019t want me to finish my though which is if anyone here wants to fact-check me instead of speak over me, you can go to the scientific literature and query what the definition is of the beginning of life, and you will find that there are different definitions,\" Dr. Phil retorted.Rose\u2019s claim that there is scientific consensus that life begins at fertilization appears to stem from a survey conducted by the nonpartisan \"Brief of Biologists as Amici Curiae in Support of Neither Party.\" The survey was submitted to the Supreme Court before the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\u00a0    The survey found that 96% of the 5,577 biologists from 1,058 academic institutions surveyed affirmed that a human\u2019s life begins at fertilization. Furthermore, 85% of the 5,577 biologists self-identified as pro-choice, 89% self-identified as liberal, and 95% claimed that they held a Ph.D.Another contentious debate erupted when Dr. Phil began to take questions from the audience. One woman began yelling at Rose for her pro-life stance. She told Rose that she had \"no empathy.\"\"There is nothing that you can possibly say to justify that level of lack of empathy,\" the woman said, prompting many in the audience to clap. \"That\u2019s the problem I feel like in this country, at the moment, we were founded on the lack of empathy, and we\u2019ve just kept up with that tradition. You have no empathy.\"  VP KAMALA HARRIS MEETS WITH CIVIL RIGHTS, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS LEADERS TO DISCUSS ABORTION ACCESS  Lila Rose of Live Action at the California March for Life (Live Action)    Rose replied that nobody talks about how devastating abortion can be on a woman\u2019s mental health, to which the audience member began speaking over her.\u00a0\"You know what it\u2019s really like to get raped and then have to have the child, what kind of trauma is that producing on somebody?\" she asked.\u00a0  \"The child\u2019s an innocent party there--,\" Rose said.\u00a0\"The child isn\u2019t born yet\u2014it\u2019s not there,\" the woman angrily replied.\u00a0  Rose said that \"generational sin\" should not be taken out on a child, to which the woman clarified that the discussion should rather be on the fact that a right was taken away, and that women should be concerned about what rights are next.\u00a0  \"I want to address that because our fundamental right that we all share in this room is life,\" Rose said. \"It\u2019s the first human right. Laws are meant to protect the week, in a society who\u2019s the weakest? Who\u2019s the weakest in society? A child. They don\u2019t have a voice.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The woman then claimed that the poorest people in a society are the weakest, not a child. Rose somewhat agreed, noting that the poor, children, and the disabled are among the weakest in society. She concluded by stating that \"whether you live 10 minutes or 10 years, or 100 years, you\u2019re a human life, and you have the right not to be killed.\"  Nikolas Lanum is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.                  \n\n\n\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox\nArrives Weekdays\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n     \n          U.S.\n         \n            Crime\n          \n            Military\n          \n            Education\n          \n            Terror\n          \n            Immigration\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Personal Freedoms\n          \n            Fox News Investigates\n          \n            Digital Originals\n          \n          Politics\n         \n            Executive\n          \n            Senate\n          \n            House\n          \n            Judiciary\n          \n            Foreign Policy\n          \n            Polls\n          \n            Elections\n          \n          World\n         \n            U.N.\n          \n            Conflicts\n          \n            Terrorism\n          \n            Disasters\n          \n            Global Economy\n          \n            Environment\n          \n            Religion\n          \n            Scandals\n          \n          Opinion\n         \n          Media\n         \n            FOX Nation Coverage\n          \n          Entertainment\n         \n            Celebrity News\n          \n            Movies\n          \n            TV News\n          \n            Music News\n          \n            Style News\n          \n            Entertainment Video\n          \n          Sports\n         \n            NFL\n          \n            College Football\n          \n            MLB\n          \n            NBA\n          \n            NHL\n          \n            Golf\n          \n            Tennis\n          \n            Soccer\n          \n            UFC\n          \n            WWE\n          \n          Lifestyle\n         \n            Health\n          \n            Food & Drink\n          \n            Auto\n          \n            Travel & Outdoors\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            House & Home\n          \n            Fitness + Well-being\n          \n            Style & Beauty\n          \n            Family\n          \n            Faith\n          \n          FOX Business\n         \n            Personal Finance\n          \n            Economy\n          \n            Markets\n          \n            Watchlist\n          \n            Lifestyle\n          \n            Real Estate\n          \n            Tech\n          \n          Science & Tech\n         \n            Air & Space\n          \n            Security\n          \n            Innovation\n          \n            Video Games\n          \n            Military Tech\n          \n            Planet Earth\n          \n            Wild Nature\n          \n          Watch Live\n         \n            FOX News Shows\n          \n            Programming Schedule\n          \n            On Air Personalities\n          \n            Full Episodes\n          \n            Show Clips\n          \n            News Clips\n          \n          About\n         \n            Contact Us\n          \n            Careers\n          \n            Fox Around the World\n          \n            Advertise With Us\n          \n            Media Relations\n          \n            Corporate Information\n          \n            Compliance\n          \n          Apps & Products\n         \n            FOX News Go\n          \n            FOX Weather\n          \n            FOX Nation\n          \n            FOX News Shop\n          \n            FOX News Radio\n          \n            Outkick\n          \n            Newsletters\n          \n            Podcasts\n           Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Flipboard LinkedIn Slack RSS Newsletters Spotify iHeartRadio Fox News New Terms of UseNew Privacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesClosed Caption PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility Statement \n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.
