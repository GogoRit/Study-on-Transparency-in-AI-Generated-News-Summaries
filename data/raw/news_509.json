However, women's rights advocates denounced that thousands of clandestine abortions are performed in the country every year, posing a risk to women's lives.\nThe Safe Abortion law was one of Abinader's campaign promises that led him to the presidency. Since taking office in August 2020, he has expressed his willingness to pass a law allowing abortion in exceptional situations.\n\n\n\n#FromTheSouth News Bits | Dominican Republic: Women demand the legalization of abortion. pic.twitter.com/pwwYk6UQTW \u2014 teleSUR English (@telesurenglish) \n   March 23, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past month, women's rights activists have been camping out in front of government headquarters in Santo Domingo to demand safe abortion in cases of rape and risks to the life of the woman or the fetus.\nOne group of activists demands\u00a0the inclusion of safe abortion in the Penal Code, while other advocates suggest including it in a special law. A third group is calling for a referendum.\nFor the moment, the decision on abortion and the possibility of holding a referendum lies in the Dominican Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n#DominicanRepublic | Assigned clean-up crews can't even scratch the surface of this polluted paradise. pic.twitter.com/QDzNvSbkKC \u2014 teleSUR English (@telesurenglish) \n    July 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nDominican Republic\nSafe abortion\nPlebiscite\nCongress\n\n\nPeople\nLuis Abinader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n                                                        EFE\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n                                                            \n                                                            \n                                                            \t \n                                                            \n                                                                by teleSUR/ age-JF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Czech Republic Expels 18 Russian Diplomats Over 2014 Blasts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDominican Republic Extends Curfew Due To COVID-19 Spike\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDominican Republic Mourns Intellectual Figure Marcio Veloz  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIran Celebrates 42 Years as Islamic Republic Amid US Blockade\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                            Comment on facebook   ()\n\n\n\n \n                           Comment on teleSUR (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nSign In or Register to leave a comment, use the forums and more\n\nSign In\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost with no comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nAbout teleSUR\nAbout Us\nContacts\nTeam\n\nTerms of Use\nteleSUR Apps\nSatellite Coverage\nRSS\nPublic Procurement\n\n\nSections\nLatin America\nWorld\nSports\nCulture\nTechnology\nOpinion\nMultimedia\nVideos\n\n\nServices\nServices Catalogue\n\n\n\nSpanish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our news bulletins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa nueva Televisi\u00f3n del Sur C.A.
