The publication\u2019s latest cover features the young 20-something Amanda Gorman, the \u201cpoet\u201d who puts far left political punditry to a meter and calls it art.\nYeah, she\u2019s the kind of once-in-a-generation artist that makes lyrics out of Planned Parenthood slogans. Who wouldn\u2019t want a young woman who rhymes about a woman\u2019s right to kill their unborn children to be the \u201cfirst ever\u201d poet on the cover of Vogue Magazine?\nOf course, if you\u2019re not familiar with Vogue\u2019s new it girl, Amanda Gorman is the 23 year-old African American who recited her poem \u201cThe Hill We Climb\u201d at the Biden presidential inauguration this past January. And ever since then she has been reveling in the glitz and glamour of media stardom.\nVogue magazine showed off the upcoming cover for their May issue on April 7, and it featured the young poet on the front, basking in the glow of a media who loves how she can spin their leftwing causes in catchy, melodramatic poetry. Yeah she\u2019s woke all right, and in addition to her being young, and a minority, that makes her a great propaganda weapon for the media.\nIn addition to her famous inauguration poem, which paid tribute to front line medical workers, Gorman has made poetry endorsing abortion, BLM and LGBTQ issues, particularly trans activism. Wow, how timely.\u00a0\nConsider the lyrics to the National Youth Poet Laureate\u2019s anti-abortion ban poem: \u201cThrough forcing them into motherhood before they\u2019re ready, these bans steadily sustain the patriarchy, but also chain families in poverty and maintain economic inequality.\u201d So beautiful. So sublime. Listeners will also be able to feast their ears on simple beauty of the poem\u2019s title, \u201c8 Reasons to Stand Up Today to Abortion Bans In the United States.\u201d Wow.\u00a0\nAnd then there\u2019s this line from Gorman\u2019s pro-BLM poem \u201cFury and Faith\u201d: \u201cBy now we understand that white supremacy and the despair it demands are as destructive as any disease. So when you\u2019re told that your rage is reactionary, remember that rage is our right.\u201d The power of those words could even move distraught small business owners in Kenosha to sympathize with BLM rioters who torched their buildings.\u00a0\n\nClearly this kind of work would attract the attention of the leftwing fashion rag. Though not only was the honor Gorman\u2019s, but it was Vogue\u2019s as well. This was the first time in the magazine\u2019s over 120 year history that they featured an actual poet on their cover.\nSarcasm aside, that\u2019s actually pretty pathetic when you think about it. So Vogue\u2019s been around 120 years and they couldn\u2019t find one prominent female poet throughout that time to put on their cover? Not Maya Angelou nor Sylvia Plath? Just some lady who puts baby killing and black supremacist slogans in rhyme form? Pathetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultureRacismLiberals & DemocratsPro-choicersCelebritiesConde-NastCulture/SocietyEntertainment MediaRace IssuesMagazines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMust Read\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n41 Times Google Has Interfered in US Elections Since 2008 Gabriela Pariseau and Dan Schneider\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\nJournalists Find the Term \u2018Illegal\u2019 More Upsetting than Violent MurderBill D'Agostino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Subscribe to Our Newsletter!\n                \nClick Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe mission of the Media Research Center is to document and combat the falsehoods and censorship of the news media, entertainment media and Big Tech in order to defend and preserve America's founding principles and Judeo-Christian values.
