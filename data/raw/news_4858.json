Wade\nBy Debra Cassens Weiss\nNovember 2, 2020, 10:40 am CST\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTweet\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage from Shutterstock.com.\n\n\nThe Roe v. Wade ruling finding a constitutional right to abortion was \u201cpulled out of thin air,\u201d according to four Alabama justices who used a special concurrence to urge the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the opinion.\nDespite their views, the four Alabama justices agreed with the court\u2019s decision to toss a lawsuit seeking to hold an abortion clinic liable for the death of a 6-week-old fetus, report Law360 and AL.com.\nThe nine-member court tossed the suit because the plaintiff had failed to comply with a rule requiring a brief to set out the issues and argument, along with citation of relevant caselaw and statutes.\nJustice Jay Mitchell wrote the Oct. 30 special concurrence, joined by Chief Justice Tom Parker and Justices Michael Bolin and Alisa Kelli Wise.\nMitchell said Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey have serious problems and are \u201cdue to be overruled.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, the central holding of Roe\u2014that there is a constitutional right to have an abortion based on a judicially created trimester framework\u2014has no grounding in the text of the United States Constitution,\u201d Mitchell wrote.\n\u201cThat holding was pulled out of thin air by using a novel theory put forward only a few years earlier in Griswold v. Connecticut, \u2026 in which the United States Supreme Court identified a constitutional right of privacy based on \u2018penumbras\u2019 extending from the \u2018emanations\u2019 of five amendments in the Bill of Rights.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the court compounded its error in Casey, when it affirmed the holding of Roe and invented a new analytical framework based on a judicially created \u2018undue burden\u2019 standard.\u201d\nRoe and Casey \u201chamstring states as they seek to prevent human tragedy and suffering,\u201d Mitchell wrote.\nThe concurrence comes as the Supreme Court now has a six-justice conservative majority.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s latest court pick, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, refused to express a view on Griswold during her confirmation hearing. The 1965 decision held that married couples have the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of their home.\nSee also:\nABAJournal.com: \u201cJustice Thomas weighs in on \u2018dismemberment abortions\u2019 and the undue burden standard\u201d\nABAJournal.com: \u201cWith Kennedy off the Supreme Court, will Roe v.
