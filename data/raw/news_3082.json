I think it was the first time to witness that many moms who rejected abortion during one campaign day in Milwaukee.\u201d\n[Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News!]\n\nPro-Life Wisconsin has hosted a 40 Days for Life program there for more than a decade, he added.\u00a0\nMiller and a group of about 300 volunteers across the state plan to participate in the upcoming spring campaign as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do an evening prayer service with several priests and likely the bishop,\u201d Miller said.\nTurning 40 days into 365 and more lives saved\nLast year, Miller and his team committed to praying at abortion centers more than just the 40 days. They made a covenant to pray daily all year long, amid the launch of 40 Days for Life 365. After starting the new 40 Days initiative Pro-Life Wisconsin saw\u00a0205 unborn lives saved through its local campaign in the six months from June to December 2021.\n\u201cWe often joked that they got the name wrong, Miller said. \u201c40 days is a nice start, but it should be 365 days for life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was strange the difference in the number of babies saved,\u201d he said of the fall campaign total. \u201cI can't say for certain, but September (his co-organizer) will tell you that it was because of the prayer. But we're always praying. I can't really put my finger on it, but I think it has something to do with commitment, the covenant \u2013 God wants a covenant with us.\u201d\nTweet This: After making a covenant to pray daily all year w/40 Days for Life 365, Pro-Life Wisconsin saw 205 unborn lives saved in 6 months.\n\nPro-Life Wisconsin celebrates a baby saved Dec. 16th\n\nMiller spends time at abortion centers praying and conducting sidewalk counseling, just like the Pro-Life Wisconsin volunteers, an act he has done for more than a decade.\n\u201cThere's no greater joy than to witness (to people going into abortion facilities),\u201d he said. \u201cI don't just sit behind the desk all week. You have to be involved. I've always been the type of person to lead by example, so if I'm expecting others to go out and do this very difficult work, I should, too.\u201d\nA desire to eliminate abortion\u00a0\nMiller sets his sights on seeing one abortion facility in Milwaukee close, a prayer he began several years ago.\u00a0\n\u201cI'm a very impatient person, and after 10 to 12 years of praying at this abortion center, I want it shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Lord, we've been here 10 to 12 years \u2013 let's go.\u2019 Some of my other people, friends in the movement, have been saying the same thing for abortion in general since 1973. I could take a lesson in patience from them.\u201d\n\nMiller addresses the group's 2021 gala/Pro-Life Wisconsin\n\nThe number of abortion facilities in Wisconsin dropped significantly in recent years, from 25 to four, Miller said.\nState laws enacted require women to meet with a counselor and physician before having an abortion and wait 24 hours afterward before undergoing the abortion. Additionally, they must have an ultrasound, and minors need a family member over age 25 to consent to the procedure. The state bans abortions after 21 weeks, except in specific cases.\nWitnessing to life in D.C.\nMiller and his team participated the 2022 national March for Life. Three buses left Wisconsin in January filled with young people and adult chaperones who attended the event in Washington, D.C. He was impressed with the turnout and the March for Life Rally speaker lineup.\n\nPro-Life Wisconsin at the 2022 national March for Life\n\n\u201cThere were so many great speakers at the March!\u201d Miller said.\nWhile in the nation\u2019s capital, several Wisconsin attendees prayed at one of the abortion facilities and witnessed other pro-life people and organizations doing the same. Miller said they were also present for a Red Rose Rescue.\n\u201cSaturday morning, we went sidewalk counseling at Planned Parenthood, and at the time there was a rescue taking place there, the Red Rose Rescue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go inside the abortion center sometimes to talk to the moms and dads; sometimes they can get in and sometimes they can't.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis particular situation they could not,\u201d Miller said, \u201cand they wound up staying in front of the door and then Planned Parenthood called the police, and they locked the door behind them. So, it was like a mission accomplished \u2013 nobody could get in and nobody could get out.\u201d\nMiller and his group talked with six women who showed up at the abortion center that morning.\n\u201cOne rejected abortion completely,\u201d he said. \u201cShe's what we would call a save, so that was good news.\u201d\u00a0\nAnother got caught up in the shuffle when the police got there. She\u2019d been trying to go in for an abortion but couldn't get in because of the police. She became frustrated and went home.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean we don't know what ultimately happened with her baby, but if she had an appointment there that day, that baby lived that one day,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe would call that a turn around.\u201d\n\nMiller and other members of Pro-Life Wisconsin's group at the 2022 March for Life\n\nSharing stories, raising awareness and funds\nAs Miller and all involved with Pro-Life Wisconsin prepare for more saves and turn-arounds in 2022, they also plan a fundraising banquet this spring. Guest speaker will be Tallulah Caulfield, a leader for Pro-Life Green Bay who experienced abortion as a teen.\n\u201cShe will share her story about how abortion affected her,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about that event.\u201d\nThe banquet is scheduled for April 28.\n\u201cThings are happening here (in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin), and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI think we can all say in one unified voice \u2018Let's end it (abortion), and let's end it soon.\u2019\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\n\nprolife\npregnancy help\nProLife Wisconsin\nDan Miller\nSeptember\n40 Days for Life\n40 Days for Life 365\nTallulah Caulfield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGayle Irwin\n\nGayle M.
