Ave. Planned Parenthood\nOctober 14, 2020Add Commentby BU News Service\n\n\n\nVolunteers with the \"40 Days for Life\" campaign say prayers outside Planned Parenthood\u2019s Greater Boston Health Center on Oct. 7, 2020.

The Boston volunteers stand outside the clinic twelve hours a day and will be on West Campus until Nov. 1.\nRita Russo, the Boston chapter\u2019s campaign director from Norwood, said the vigils are not a protest, and while Massachusetts is very liberal, the participants show respect to those who disagree with them.\u00a0\n\u201cPeople pass by, and most people ignore us, some people thank us, and some people swear at us and give us the finger,\u201d Russo said.\nRita Russo leads the Boston chapter of \u201c40 Days for Life\u201d in a vigil on Oct. 7, 2020. Photo by Rhian Lowndes / BU News Service\nRusso said abortion had been sold as an \u201ceasy solution\u201d to younger generations and that 40 Days for Life wants to offer help to women in crisis.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very high opinion of Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Russo. \u201cThey give less real healthcare, less pap smears every year, fewer breast exams, and if you\u2019re really sick, they have to refer you elsewhere because they don\u2019t offer those services. They say they\u2019re about women\u2019s health \u2013 they\u2019re not. They\u2019re about abortion, contraception, sex education, so more children [entering] into an active sex life at an earlier age to be more abortion customers. It\u2019s all about money.\u201d\nWhile there has been an approximate 20% decrease in breast exams between the 2016 and 2019 Planned Parenthood annual reports, and a 9% decrease in pap smears, there has only been a 1% increase in abortion services. Planned Parenthood has also completed 8% more HIV tests and diagnosed 7.5% more STIs.\u00a0\nRusso, who was accompanied by one other volunteer last Tuesday and four on Wednesday, handed out cards to people she spoke to. The cards offered an abortion after-care program\u2019s contact information, a 24/7 hotline for abortion pill reversal, different support groups for people with unintended pregnancies, and a human trafficking hotline.\u00a0\nLorraine, who prayed with Russo on Tuesday and only gave her first name, helped give out information to anyone who stopped to speak with the 40 Days for Life campaign.\n\u201cPeople are desperate,\u201d she said of abortion clients visiting the Planned Parenthood clinic. \u201cThey think it\u2019s their only solution.\u201d\u00a0\nRebecca Hart Holder, the executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts, said in an email that reproductive rights and services, such as those offered by Planned Parenthood, provide \u201cthe ability to decide, if, when, or how to start a family.\u201d\nWith Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s ongoing confirmation hearing, Holder worries that views like Russo\u2019s will control legislation.\nShe said that Barrett\u2019s installment on the Supreme Court \u201cis yet another attempt to achieve [the Trump] administration\u2019s and the anti-choice movement\u2019s ultimate goal of denying us the ability to control our lives, bodies, and futures.\u201d\nShe also believes that SCOTUS\u2019s shift will negatively affect voting rights, LGBTQ rights, health care, racial justice, immigrant justice, and environmental justice.\n\u201cThis is not just an attack on our reproductive freedom, it\u2019s an attack on our nation\u2019s values,\u201d said Holder.\u00a0\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) \n\n\nFacebookXPinterestLinkedIn \n\n\n\n\nProtest at Gov.
