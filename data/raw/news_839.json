[+] November 1, 2021.Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nA state judge in Bexar County, Texas, threw out a lawsuit brought against Dr. Alan Braid, an abortion provider in Texas who confessed in a Washington Post op-ed that he had performed an abortion despite Texas\u2019 SB 8 law, which bans all abortions after approximately six weeks of pregnancy and is enforced through private lawsuits.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by former Illinois attorney Felipe Gomez in September 2021, is one of several that were brought in court against Braid\u2014so far the only defendant who\u2019s known to have been sued under the law\u2014and the first major ruling issued in a lawsuit brought under SB 8.\n\n\n\nThe state court found Gomez didn\u2019t have standing to sue because he wasn\u2019t directly impacted by the abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented Braid.\n\n\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t overturn SB 8, but the Center for Reproductive Rights called it a \u201csignificant win,\u201d as it sets a precedent that might make it more likely courts deciding future lawsuits brought under SB 8 will shut them down.\n\n\nGomez filed the litigation despite actually being opposed to SB 8, describing himself in the lawsuit as a \u201cpro-choice plaintiff\u201d and asking for the court to find the law unconstitutional, rather than award him the $10,000 in damages that SB 8 expressly allows.\n\n\nGomez told Forbes in an email he was waiting before providing further comment, but filed a notice of appeal in the case late Thursday.\n\n\n\n\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cWhen I provided my patient with the care she needed last year, I was doing my duty as a physician,\u201d Braid said in a statement.\nWhat To Watch For\nThe ruling throwing out the case was issued verbally from the bench during a hearing Thursday, and the Center for Reproductive Rights reports that a written order will come at some point in the next week. The order will have no effect on the law beyond dismissing Gomez\u2019s case, and Texas has separate abortion laws criminalizing the procedure that also remain in effect. Braid still faces multiple other lawsuits in state court, including one brought by Arkansas attorney Oscar Stilley, who, unlike Gomez, wants the court to award him damages. The doctor countersued Gomez, Stilley and Wolfgang P. Hirczy de Mino, who also sued Braid under SB 8, in federal court in response to their lawsuits. That litigation was dismissed in September, but court records show Braid is appealing the decision.\nKey Background\nTexas\u2019 SB 8 took effect in September 2021, becoming the most stringent abortion restrictions to take effect in the U.S. until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and sparked more abortion bans nationwide. The law was an attempt to ban abortion without having the law be struck down in court, as enforcing the ban through private lawsuits rather than through the state makes it harder for opponents to name defendants who a court can actually block from enforcing the law. The Supreme Court allowed the law to stay in place in December 2021, and other states went on to pass their own copycat bills that are similarly enforced through private lawsuits. While Texas abortion providers broadly stopped providing abortions after six weeks once SB 8 took effect, Braid said in his Post op-ed that he performed an abortion as an act of protest and he \u201cwanted to make sure that Texas didn\u2019t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested.\u201d Though Texas and other states have now enacted abortion bans that outlaw the procedure outright and make it a criminal offense to perform an abortion, SB 8 and the similar bills it inspired remain in place, making it possible any physician who performs an abortion could face private civil lawsuits on top of criminal penalties.\n\nTangent\nGomez has had his law license suspended indefinitely in Illinois after sending \u201cthreatening and harassing email messages\u201d to attorneys in three separate legal matters, the Illinois State Bar Association reported in September. In his email to Forbes, Gomez characterized himself as a \u201cretired (not currently suspended) former attorney.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading\nFirst Private Citizen To Be Sued Under Texas Abortion Law Is Doctor Who Publicly Admitted Performing Abortion (Forbes)\nDoctor Sued For Violating Texas Abortion Ban Countersues Accusers And Asks Court To Strike Down Law (Forbes)\n\nSan Antonio doctor who openly flouted Texas abortion ban sued by disbarred attorneys (KSAT)\nLawyer who sued Texas abortion provider faces 3-year suspension (Reuters)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Alison DurkeeEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
