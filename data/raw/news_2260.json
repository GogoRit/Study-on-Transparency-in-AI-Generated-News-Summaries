Anthony List was in Tampa and Orlando Friday to canvass as part of their efforts to re-elect President Donald Trump, calling him the most pro-life president ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day after Florida\u2019s Senate voted on a controversial parental consent bill, a national pro-life group announced a multi-million dollar campaign that targets Florida voters in particular.The Susan B. Anthony List was in Tampa and Orlando on Friday as part of their efforts to re-elect President Donald Trump, calling him the \u201cmost pro-life president ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan B. Anthony List and the Women Speak Out Pac joined members of Florida Family Action, the Life Issues Institute, Guiding Star Tampa LifeChoices Women's Care, and Students for Life Action to announce Donald Trump re-election campaign efforts in Florida. CREDIT: DAYLINA MILLER/WUSF PUBLIC MEDIA\n\n\n\nThey say their ground team has already visited more than 146,000 homes across the state, and their Women Speak Out PAC\u2019s ad calling Democrats the \u201cParty of Death\u201d began airing Friday in a limited ad buy in those markets.Jill Stanek, SBA List National Campaign Chair, said that in 2016: \"We visited 500,000 voters and President Trump won by 112,000. So we helped him win. And then in 2018, we visited over a million voters and Senator Scott only won by 12,000 votes. And also Governor DeSantis won by just a few more.\u201dIn addition to Florida, the field team is currently active in Arizona and North Carolina. The team plans an expansion to Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin and says they will make four million visits to voters nationally overall before Election Day.\u201cLiberals and sometimes the media downplay the importance of abortion in an election, but it was very important to people in 2016,\u201d Stanek said. \u201cOn election day, the most searched word by far was \u2018abortion.\u2019 And we are simply here to educate voters on where the candidates stand and where the president stands.\u201dThe re-election effort includes boots on the ground, door-to-door canvassing, voter contact mail, phone calls, and paid advertising. The campaign is part of the organization\u2019s overall $52 million budget for the 2019-2020 cycle.\u201cWe\u2019re asking people to connect their values and their convictions on this issue to the election itself, and to vote accordingly,\u201d said John Stemberger, President of Florida Family Action.The group also showed their support for a bill passed by the Florida Senate Thursday that would require minors to get parental consent for abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Stemberger, President of Florda Family Action, spoke alongside Susan B. Anthony List leaders Friday to announce a concerted effort to reach Florida voters to encourage re-election of Donald Trump.

Ron DeSantis\u2019 desk. He\u2019s already said he will sign it into law.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nHealth News Florida\n2020 Elections\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaylina Miller\n\n\n                \n                    I took my first photography class when I was 11.
