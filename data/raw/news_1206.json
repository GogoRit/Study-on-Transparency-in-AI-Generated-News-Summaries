Not by Maura Healey, her office saysUpdated: May. 08, 2022, 12:08 p.m.|Published: May. 07, 2022, 6:00 a.m.\"I think what's important is that people find ways to communicate, talk to, work with one another,\" Attorney General Maura Healey said.By Will Katcher | WKatcher@masslive.comMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey would not enforce a nationwide ban on abortion if it were passed by Congress, her office said.How exactly would she avoid enforcing a federal law? By the same logic that allows a recreational marijuana dispensary a half-mile from the office of Massachusetts\u2019 top prosecutor.\u201cThe state could refuse to enforce a nationwide abortion ban without seemingly real backlash,\u201d said Paul Collins, a University of Massachusetts professor of legal studies and Supreme Court expert. \u201cThink about recreational marijuana. A state can legalize recreational marijuana but the federal government can still make it illegal. If the federal government wanted to shut down all the marijuana shops, it could. But it\u2019s unlikely that it could force the state of Massachusetts to do that on its behalf.\u201dAs the real possibility of an overturned Roe v. Wade emerged in a report from Politico Monday night, the next phase of the reproductive rights battle was already underway: a push from anti-abortion groups for a nationwide ban on the procedure.The Washington Post followed Politico\u2019s story with a report that conservative activists, Republican presidential contenders and top congressional Republicans were already laying out a path to a federal ban on abortion.05/03/22 - BOSTON, MA - A rally is held outside the Massachusetts State House and a subsequent march around the Boston Commons to protest the Supreme Court\u2019s leaked decision to overturn Roe vs Wade on Tuesday, May 3, 2022.

And the idea was plainly rejected by Healey, who said through a spokesperson: \u201cAbortion is a protected constitutional right in Massachusetts and our office will make sure that all women have access.\u201dA nationwide abortion ban would on paper trump any Massachusetts law \u2014 the product of the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, which says that federal law overrides state law.But if the federal government passed and wanted to enforce a nationwide abortion ban, it would face an incredible challenge in doing so.It is unlikely that Massachusetts could be compelled to enforce the law on the federal government\u2019s behalf, Collins said. It\u2019s not clear to him which federal entity would enforce the measure instead, and whether that agency would even have the staffing to do it.\u201cJust imagine the logistics. How would the federal government know who is providing abortions? That requires a pretty intimate knowledge of the patient-doctor relationship,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe federal government doesn\u2019t have access to that information and I have a strong sense that doctors wouldn\u2019t be providing that info to the government anyway.\u201d05/03/22 - BOSTON, MA - A rally is held outside the Massachusetts State House and a subsequent march around the Boston Commons to protest the Supreme Court\u2019s leaked decision to overturn Roe vs Wade on Tuesday, May 3, 2022. Photo by Alyssa StoneStone, AlyssaIn other words, \u201cit\u2019s harder than knowing if there\u2019s a cannabis shop a mile from you right now,\u201d he said.The possibility of a nationwide abortion ban emerged as a serious fear of many supporters of abortion access in the last week.Politico reported Monday that a conservative Supreme Court majority was prepared to toss out the landmark precedent of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case guaranteeing the right to an abortion, as well as the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey that largely upheld Roe.Included by the news outlet was a leaked draft of Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s majority opinion in the case, a highly rare breach of the court\u2019s confidentiality.In the wake of Politico\u2019s story, Massachusetts officials cautioned that little would change in the commonwealth if Roe were struck down.\u201cAbortion is legal\u201d and \u201cwill remain legal in Massachusetts,\u201d Healey wrote on Twitter following Politico\u2019s report.A crowd of people gather outside the Supreme Court, Monday night, May 2, 2022 in Washington.

Wade that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a report published Monday night in Politico.

Though a ban would not evidently be enforced in Massachusetts, nearly half of the states could effectively cut off abortion access on their own without Roe v. Wade in place.\u201cIf we see a federal abortion ban, it won\u2019t matter what\u2019s in Massachusetts law. That\u2019s a really scary thing,\u201d said Rebecca Hart Holder, executive director of Reproductive Equity Now. \u201cIt\u2019s something we should be thinking about and we should be very worried about.\u201dAfter conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, Massachusetts lawmakers conscious of the possibility of an overturned Roe v. Wade passed the ROE Act, overriding Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s veto to expand abortion access for some teenagers and mothers past 24 weeks of pregnancy.\u201cIf heaven forbid Roe were to fall, there would be absolutely no interruption in care in Massachusetts because we have protected access to abortion in Massachusetts law,\u201d Hart Holder said after the law passed.The legislation lowered the age to receive an abortion without a parent\u2019s consent or court order from 18 to 16. It also allowed abortion past 24 weeks in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly or if the pregnancy would affect the health of the mother.Should Roe v. Wade be overturned, abortion restrictions would be at the whim of the states. In Massachusetts, the ROE Act and legal precedents would not be changed from their current forms.But though Massachusetts would see little effect from the loss of Roe, residents of other states would still see the result, Collins said. Other states may also see the loss of rights that he and other legal scholars warned could be withdrawn using the same legal logic applied to Roe \u2014 including a diminished view on the right to privacy.The U.S. Supreme Court is seen early Tuesday, May 3, 2022 in Washington. A draft opinion suggests the U.S. Supreme Court could be poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a Politico report released Monday. Whatever the outcome, the Politico report represents an extremely rare breach of the court's secretive deliberation process, and on a case of surpassing importance. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)APIf Roe v. Wade were to fall, the door would open for other civil liberties granted by the Supreme Court to follow, including access to contraception, same-sex marriage and sexual privacy in the home, argued Laurence Tribe, a Constitutional law expert and Harvard Law School professor.All could come to pass, representing a backslide in unenumerated rights \u2014 those not explicitly stated in the Constitution \u2014 that Tribe said had \u201clong [been] taken for granted.\u201d\u201cWhen you read the leaked opinion, it\u2019s not hard to conclude that the court will take steps to restrict freedoms concerning the right to privacy,\u201d Collins said.The right to privacy covers a vast array of personal freedoms, including the right to make medical decisions and the right to engage in consensual sexual conduct in the privacy of the home.\u201cThe draft opinion says it pertains only to abortion rights but there are reasons to believe that is not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThis opinion is significant not only in that it would overrule Roe v. Wade but also in that the legal logic can be applied to take away a variety of rights that the Supreme Court has found since the 1960s.\u201cIt\u2019s not at all challenging to read Justice Alito\u2019s opinion and see that it could be used to overrule marriage equality, sexual privacy and it can be read to allow states to restrict contraceptives.\u201dRelated Content:Massachusetts abortion laws: If Roe v.
