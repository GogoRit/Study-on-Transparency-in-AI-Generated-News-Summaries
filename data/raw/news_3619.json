Wade on June 24.\u00a0\nKlimek is one of the handful of other pro-life individuals who were at the center on Saturday morning, although there have often been dozens of people there in the past. Some have even spent their Saturday mornings standing outside abortion clinics for years. \u00a0\nKlimek said his main goal when visiting Planned Parenthood is to talk with people seeking abortions and provide them with information and resources available in the area that could help them in their pregnancy.\u00a0\nHe and other pro-life individuals point people seeking abortions to crisis pregnancy centers such as Gateway Women's Care, which has locations in Chapel Hill, Raleigh and Durham. According to its website, Gateway provides pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, STI testing and \"options counseling.\"\u00a0\nHowever, pro-choice organizations like Pro-Choice North Carolina state that crisis pregnancy centers often use misleading advertisements and medically inaccurate information to attract patients.\u00a0\nLydia Taylor, president of Campbell Students For Life at Campbell University, has also stood outside the Planned Parenthood clinic in Chapel Hill to speak with those seeking abortions.\n\"Both my organization and I go to abortion clinics to provide pregnancy resources to women seeking abortion and inform them of how abortion will only hurt them and their baby,\" she said.\u00a0\nChelsea Smith, a graduate student at UNC, is president and a founder of Pro Life Future of the Triangle, an organization that caters to young adults in the area who want to be involved in pro-life activities.\u00a0\nShe said when her organization speaks with people on the sidewalk of the Chapel Hill Planned Parenthood, they promote and represent Standing With You, a national database that includes pregnancy resources alongside information about food banks and shelters.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Standing With You) is kind of just like a place to gather all of these resources in one place,\" Smith said. \"So when we're on the sidewalk, we're representing them and we're trying to get the word out about all these different resources.\"\nAccording to an email statement from UNC Students for Life, the group has also stood outside the Chapel Hill Planned Parenthood.\u00a0\nKlimek said many people who faced unplanned pregnancies do not have support systems in their lives and may not be aware of options besides abortion, which is why he wants to let them know of available support.\u00a0\n\"Maybe they don't have someone they can talk to, maybe they don't have the best relationship with their intimate partner,\" he said. \"Sometimes they face pressure to get rid of the baby and want to stay in that relationship. And they come to abortion clinics because they feel like there's no other place.\"\nKlimek also said while people are not allowed to stand on the premises of Planned Parenthood, they will stand close to the road and try to flag down cars as they pull in.\u00a0\nHe said the goal is not to pressure those seeking services at Planned Parenthood to speak with members of his group if they have made it clear they are not interested.\nTaylor said that while there is a common misconception that pro-life groups go to abortion clinics to condemn or yell at those seeking the services, this is not her intention.\nShe added that she and her organization have received mixed responses to their presence at the clinic.\u00a0\n\"Many people at the clinics are receptive and talk to us, and many women do end up choosing life and allowing us to help them,\" she said. \"However, we also get harassed, threatened and bullied for what we do.\"\u00a0\nUNC Students for Life said the group has experienced hostility while outside Planned Parenthood, but it has also encountered people who are open to speaking with them.\u00a0\n\"We have had conversations with several women, and while we do not know the outcome of the majority of these conversations, a couple of women have left the clinic without going inside for their appointment,\" the organization said in an email.\nKlimek said that no matter the response from those seeking abortions, he is always glad for the opportunity to speak with people who are willing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n        To get the day's news and headlines in your inbox each morning, sign up for our email newsletters.\n    \n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\n\n\n\n@_ElizabethEgan\n@DTHCityState | city@dailytarheel.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Print Edition\n\n\n\nThe Daily Tar Heel's 2024 Music Edition\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in City & County\n\n\nCriminal justice diversion programs redirect, guide individuals\nRunoff confirmed in Orange County Schools Board of Education election\nN.C. voters select party nominees for Council of State races in primary races\n\n\nMore in The OC Report\n\n\nCriminal justice diversion programs redirect, guide individuals\nRunoff confirmed in Orange County Schools Board of Education election\nN.C. voters select party nominees for Council of State races in primary races\n\n\nMore in City & State\n\n\nCriminal justice diversion programs redirect, guide individuals\nRunoff confirmed in Orange County Schools Board of Education election\nN.C. voters select party nominees for Council of State races in primary races\n\n\nMore in Community members attend inaugural Chapel Hill-Carrboro Juneteenth events\n\n\nUNC School of Medicine faculty take community approach to combat burnout\nCriminal justice diversion programs redirect, guide individuals\n'It is a human right': Four students tackle menstrual equity at UNC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity\nStudent Life\nAdministration\nFaculty\nUNC System\n\n\nCity & State\nChapel Hill\nCarrboro\nOrange County\nNorth Carolina\nGeneral Assembly\n\n\nLifestyle\nArts & Entertainment\nFood & Drink\nReviews & Trends\nCommunity\n\n\n\n\nSports\nFootball\nWomen's Basketball\nMen's Basketball\nBaseball\nField Hockey\nWomen's Soccer\nMen's Soccer\nVolleyball\nWomen's Lacrosse\nMen's Lacrosse\nSoftball\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\nEditorials\nCartoons\nColumns\nLetters\n\n\nMultimedia\nData\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nAudio\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nHiring\nBoard of Directors\nAlumni\nCorrections\nContact\nPolicies & Bylaws\n\n\nAdvertise\nClassifieds\nEvents Calendar\nCelebrations\nObituaries\n\n\n\n\nPrint Archive\n\n\n1893 Brand Studio\n\n\nShop\nBuy Photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    All rights reserved\n                    \u00a9 2024 The Daily Tar Heel\n                    Powered by  Solutions by The State News\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOIN THE START THEPRESSES SOCIETY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Support independent, student-led journalism by becoming a member of the Start the Presses Society!
