The 5\u20134 decision in June Medical Services v. Russo was a significant victory for Travis \u201cTJ\u201d Tu \u201903, senior counsel for US litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights. He briefed the case that Julie Rikelman, the center\u2019s litigation director, argued in March on behalf of a clinic that challenged the law.\u00a0The\u00a0requirement would have forced the shutdown of two abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving just one abortion provider in the state.\n \nTravis Tu '03\u201cIt\u2019s a case out of Louisiana that would effectively put abortion out of reach for almost all women in the state,\u201d said\u00a0Tu before the oral argument. \u201cSo it\u2019s a life or death case for the clients in Louisiana that also has potentially huge reverberations for the country at large.\u201d The Louisiana law was similar to a Texas law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016;\u00a0at stake in June Medical Services v. Russo\u00a0was\u00a0whether abortion providers who challenge restrictions on their practice have standing to advocate for the rights of their patients as well. \u00a0\nThis kind of work is what Tu had envisioned as a law student with his heart set on public service. Prior to enrolling at NYU Law, he worked for the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania, lobbying for issues including LGBTQ rights, reproductive rights, and support for needle exchange programs. He later joined Lambda Legal as a legal assistant turned public communications coordinator, educating the public on issues related to LGBTQ rights.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cIn the course of doing that work, I had met a lot of brilliant lawyers who were making a lot of positive change in the world, and I wanted to be those people,\u201d Tu says.\u00a0\nWhen he was considering law schools, Tu says that he was energized by his experience at NYU Law\u2019s events for prospective students, and being accepted into the Root-Tilden-Kern program solidified his decision to attend the Law School. He served as editor-in-chief of the NYU Law Review, and recalls being particularly interested in courses that provided insight into the courtroom, including Civil Procedure with Helen Hershkoff and Evidence with Burt Neuborne. Those courses offered lessons that truly sank in once he was a practicing lawyer, he says.\nAs a student speaker at Law School convocation, he talked about the legal challenges that he and his peers would be called to address in politically divisive, post-9/11 world. \u201cWhen things go badly in our nation, people will look to lawyers to help sort everything out,\u201d Tu said to his classmates.\u00a0\nAfter graduating, Tu clerked for Sonia Sotomayor, now a U.S. Supreme Court justice, when she was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He joined Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler as an associate and became a litigation partner in 2012.\nDuring his time at the firm, Tu\u2019s practice centered on false advertising, consumer fraud, and unfair competition cases. He also was active in pro bono and public interest matters, representing amicus curae in two landmark same-sex marriage cases in the Supreme Court: the American Bar Association United States v. Windsor, and a coalition of elected officers in Obergefell v. Hodges. Tu also served as co-chair of the firm\u2019s Diversity Committee.\u00a0\nMore recently, in response to what he described as an unsettling political atmosphere nationally, Tu decided that the next step in his career would be in public service, defending civil rights. Crossing paths with Nancy Northup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, whom he had first met as a law student, Tu found the organization\u2019s efforts compelling.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I spoke to her and realized what the center was facing in terms of the onslaught of anti-abortion restrictions that were coming, and certainly the changed Court\u2026 I said, \u2018This is the right place and the right time,\u2019\u201d Tu says. He joined the center in 2018.\nIn February, as Tu and Rikelman prepared for their Supreme Court appearance, they fine-tuned their arguments through moot sessions at various law schools, including an argument at NYU Law on February 3. That moot session was coordinated by NYU Law adjunct professor Yaira Dubin, counsel at O\u2019Melveny & Meyers, who is also co-counsel for the plaintiffs in June Medical Services v. Russo.\nOne week after the Supreme Court argument, Tu returned to NYU Law\u00a0to join Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law Melissa Murray for a panel discussion on the case that was hosted by the American Constitution\u00a0Society at NYU Law, If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, and the Supreme Court Forum.\u00a0\nPosted February 26, 2020\nUpdated August 13, 2020\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\u201cAs a lawyer, author, and bioethicist Katie Watson \u201992 examines the relationship between the body and the state\u201d\nNYU Law website 8/20/18\n\u201cNathan Wessler \u201910 argues a key Fourth Amendment case before the Supreme Court\u201d\nNYU Law website 1/22/18\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNewsExplore this Section\u00a0\n\n\nAll Headlines\nIdeas from NYU Law\nLaw School Magazine\nPress Highlights\nFor the Media\nFaculty Experts\nJournals and Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nDirectories\n\n\nOffices and Departments\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\nVisitor Information\n\n\nNYU School of Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2023 New York University School of Law.\n40 Washington Sq.
