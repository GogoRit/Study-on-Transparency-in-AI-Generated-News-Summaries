Wade has been overturned, a new book, Your Pro-Life Bottom Line by Brett Attebery, seems of providential timing in its release. Attebery is the president and CEO of Heroic Media, which specializes in direct-response marketing ads to redirect abortion-seeking women away from Planned Parenthood ads and connect them instead to highly-skilled pregnancy centers. Attebery is enthusiastic as he addresses business professionals, philanthropists and all those passionate about pro-life matters, informing them about the pro-life business industry and teaching them how to get involved. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHe begins by sharing with his readers the inspiration that led to his work in the pro-life business industry (PLBI). Seated alone in the adoration chapel of Our Lady of Czestochowa in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, on April 28, 2013, tears streamed down his face as he turned to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, and prayed, \u201cLord, please use me to help young women and men not to make the same mistake I made.\u201d The mistake, he explained, was the terrible choice made with his girlfriend years earlier to abort their unborn child. Following his conversion to the Catholic Church in 2002, he joined the pro-life movement. However, in 2013, after experiencing what he called an \u201cepiphany moment\u201d at a Rachel\u2019s Vineyard post-abortive retreat, followed by his prayer a few weeks later, he understood a new call to redirect his talent in the economics and consumer-product marketing industry, and to engage full-time on the battlefield of business against what he calls the \u201cGoliath\u201d of the pro-abortion industry, Planned Parenthood.\nAlthough the book was released before the repeal of Roe v. Wade, Attebery anticipated the possibility but cautions readers, \u201cPlanned Parenthood has not been sitting still, embracing a strategy of wishful thinking, hoping that Roe v. Wade won\u2019t be overturned.\u201d Instead, the abortion giant anticipated the change and redirected its strategy, knowing restrictions on the sale and distribution of the abortion pill can and will be lifted. Catchy phrases, including \u201cmy body, my choice,\u201d may display a veneer of moral advocacy on behalf of women\u2019s rights, he says. \u201cBut consider this: Planned Parenthood regularly pushes the directors of its clinics to meet or exceed abortion quotas. As a business professional, you know what that means \u2014 Planned Parenthood clinic directors have to \u2018make their numbers.\u2019\u201d\nFortunately, there is an industry competing against the abortion industry to shrink its devastating \u201cnumbers\u201d to zero. And that industry is what Attebery calls the pro-life business industry, consisting of all pro-life pregnancy centers in aggregate that offer women life-giving alternatives to abortion, plus all organizations that support them. In the United States, there are between 3,000 and 4,000 pro-life pregnancy centers compared to about 1,300 abortion facilities. To which statistics, Attebery concludes, \u201cAdvantage PLBI, right? Well, no. Why not?\u201d Because the market-share number of 99 \u201cclient wins\u201d for the typical abortion facility for every one \u201cclient win\u201d for the typical pro-life pregnancy center does not equal winning for the PLBI. In fact, \u201cI can assure you,\u201d Attebery says, \u201cthe PLBI is not winning in its battle against the abortion industry, especially against Planned Parenthood. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s not even a contest.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nA bleak assessment, for sure. However, there is reason for hope as Attebery continues to provide business analysis, all the while goading his readers toward the center of the book. There, they learn about a pro-life pregnancy center in St. Louis, Missouri that, from 2009 to 2018, shrank the number of abortions in the city from 6,881 to nearly zero, forcing the Planned Parenthood clinic to close.\nAttebery attributes the win to Bridget VanMeans, a former fashion model turned business professional who was hired as a \u201cturnaround queen\u201d by Nutrisystem to save the company from failure. Successful, she became the regional manager for some 25 locations in the greater Chicago area. Deciding to save the St. Louis pro-life pregnancy center from extinction, VanMeans left Nutrisystem. Attebery shares the whole of her testimony in the book, which begins as she arrived in St. Louis in 2009:\nWhen I decided to join the center that would later become ThriVe, they were ... less than thirty days away from bankruptcy. So, when I drove into St. Louis with my daughter (I\u2019m a single mom) and my two dogs ... the organization was living off credit on a credit card. There was no money in the bank. They had laid off people, and the donors were staying away by the thousands. Because ThriVe was spiraling down, I acted. If the organization had been doing well, I would have been tempted to adopt their existing ways of doing things. But because it was less than thirty days away from bankruptcy, I couldn\u2019t afford to adopt their existing ways. I don\u2019t think the Lord wanted me to think about this challenge like a religious person ... he didn\u2019t want me to think like the other pro-life pregnancy centers think.\nVanMeans knew that most pregnancy centers \u201cthink\u201d from a moral perspective, working to save babies from abortion and to save women from post-abortive regret. But now, VanMeans understood she must develop her spreadsheets according to a business perspective and compete head-on against Planned Parenthood in order to win the market share of its target client: the pregnant woman in fear. VanMeans\u2019 testimony explained the strategy: \u00a0\u00a0\nWe think about the young woman as a consumer. What is she buying? People think she\u2019s buying an abortion, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s buying a future. She sees her unexpected pregnancy as the end of hope and the end of a future. She\u2019s also feeling like she\u2019s buying a medical solution because Planned Parenthood ... brainwashed her into thinking that this is a medical choice \u2014 not an ethical choice, not even a parenting choice. I constantly remind my partners: The girl walking into our center, pregnant, is the single most pro-abortion consumer in the world at that moment. For these young women, we\u2019ve lost the moral argument.\nDoes not the wisdom of her strategy confirm Jesus\u2019 words to all of his disciples? \u201cBehold, I am sending you like sheep among wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.\u201d (Matthew 10:16) VanMeans gathered a team made up of former mentors at Nutrisystem whom she called \u201cgreat Catholic men,\u201d showed them her unconventional strategy, and they agreed the principles would honor God, faith-based or not. Her testimony includes an explanation of the \u201cfruit\u201d of the strategy as she described a typical day at ThriVe:\nWhen a young woman walks in at ThriVe she is going to feel something different. She\u2019s going to engage with wonderful people who also understand cultural relevance. We know how to wear our hair, our scrubs, our gear. ... We outfit ourselves in a way where we have the greatest opportunity to position great medical services. We have her in an environment that screams of abundance, so when we tell her that we\u2019re going to help her, she feels, \u2018Oh yeah, I guess these people really could help me. This place is awesome.\u2019\u201d\nIn the same way, would it not be truly \u201cawesome\u201d for all pregnant women that enter any pro-life pregnancy center to feel the same way? Absolutely. And for that reason, Your Pro-Life Bottom Line is a must-read for business professionals and philanthropists serious about getting involved and being effective against the \u201cGoliath\u201d of the abortion industry, Planned Parenthood, on the battlefield of business. Brett Attebery is convinced that together, we can win.\nAnd with God\u2019s help, we will!\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \npro-life centers\ncrisis pregnancy center\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Sokol Jennifer Sokol writes from Shoreline, Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassachusetts Pregnancy Centers Form Alliance in Face of Campaign Against Them\n\nOne of the ways the alliance is working to share its message is through video testimonials on YouTube of women whose lives were positively impacted through the services of pro-life pregnancy centers.\n\n\nJoe Bukuras/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Planned, and Not Rejected: How Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers Care for Mothers and Their Babies\n\nProviders continue helping expectant women and families long after their babies are born.\n\n\nSusan Klemond\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Arrests Have Been Made in Connection With Attacks on Catholic Churches and Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers\n\nHere\u2019s what is known so far.\n\n\nJoe Bukuras/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Is Room at the Inn: This Christmas Party Is All About Mother and Child\n\nA story of helping little ones and their moms.\n\n\nK.V.
