Did you know that legal abortion is\u00a0not \u201csafe\u201d even when it\u2019s legal? These are not facts you are likely to find in mainstream reporting.\u00a0\n\nGuest post by Students for Life of America\u2019s Contributing Writer Anna Reynolds\nPro-life doctors are counteracting pro-abortion lies with facts. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG)\u00a0announced\u00a0a new campaign to equip pro-life doctors with informational resources. With fact sheets addressing common false claims, doctors will have additional resources to help articulate the logic of the pro-life position and defend doctors\u2019 rights to continue life-affirming care.\u00a0\nAAPLOG\u00a0was founded as a pro-life special interest group in the weeks after the 1973\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision legalized abortion in all 50 states. The group has grown to a membership of 7,000 pro-life obstetricians and gynecologists and hosts an annual conference.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe abortion industry has a long-standing history of\u00a0disinformation. Big Abortion\u2019s friends in the media frequently trot out the same old lies about abortion. Following the Supreme Court decision overturning\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0earlier this year, pro-abortion news outlets went into high gear. Specifically, most major media outlets have pushed the false narrative that in a post-Roe\u00a0America, women\u2019s lives are at risk and there will be a surge of maternal deaths.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are a few alarmist headlines in mainstream news outlets: \u201cMaternal Mortality is Likely to Rise Post-Roe,\u201d \u201cHealth experts see rise in maternal mortality post-Roe,\u201d \u201c\u2018No question\u2019 that U.S. maternal mortality rate will rise post-Roe, experts say.\u201d\u00a0\nIn a memo to members shared with the Washington Examiner Washington Secrets column, the pro-life doctors\u00a0state, \u201cToday, AAPLOG is launching a new campaign to address misinformation with facts using these tools.\u201d The statement added, \u201cTogether, we can clear up the myths that are circulating and get the facts out there. And by doing so, we\u2019ll help provide both our patients the best healthcare possible.\u201d\u00a0\nA fact sheet also shared with the Washington Secrets column included examples from mainstream reporting that misleading on abortion. For example, a story on NPR falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0that \u201csome abortions are necessary to save the life of a patient.\u201d AAPLOG responded that \u201celective abortion is not lifesaving medical care. OB/GYNs will still be able to offer lifesaving medical care to pregnant women. No laws on elective abortion will impact that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIn another example, a CBS story\u00a0stated: \u201cPeople will die: OB-GYNs explain how ectopic pregnancy and other complications threaten lives without abortion care.\u201d Using medical emergencies like ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages is a common scare tactic of the abortion lobby, but there is no basis in fact. AAPLOG explained, \u201cThese circumstances [ectopic pregnancy] are entirely different than an elective abortion, which purposefully ends the life of an unborn child.\u201d\u00a0\nIn response to the NBC headline quoted above, \u201c\u2018No question\u2019 that U.S. maternal mortality rate will rise post-Roe, experts say,\u201d AAPLOG\u00a0noted, \u201cThe data clearly shows that restricting abortion does not lead to an increase in maternal mortality.\u201d\u00a0\nStudents for Life of America has previously reported extensively on the facts about the\u00a0dangers of abortion for women and the\u00a0flawed studies\u00a0continually pushed by pro-abortion groups. Post-Roe\u00a0America is not the dystopian\u00a0Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u00a0that abortion activists want you to believe.\u00a0Pro-life states\u00a0have demonstrated that legislators are not only protecting preborn lives but also expanding services for families and ensuring that women have access to alternatives to abortion.\u00a0\n\n\nToo often, the fearmongering of abortion activists is left unquestioned in public discourse. In an environment in which doctors are discouraged from questioning the status quo, some OB-GYNs may not be willing to speak out. By disseminating evidence-based pro-life claims in the public square, AAPLOG gives pro-life doctors the encouragement they may need to tell the truth about abortion.\u00a0\nThe beneficiaries are not only the physicians who may feel they can speak out; patients deserve to know the facts. AAPLOG noted, \u201cThis [campaign] is all part of our mission to empower women with information so they can make fully informed healthcare decisions and empower you with the evidence you need to defend your practice of life-affirming medicine.\u201d Once again, the abortion activists who have called themselves \u201cpro-choice\u201d show that they are concerned with abortion, not informed choices.\n\n Post Views: 3,087\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.Abortion DeathBlogBlogrollhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolPlanned ParenthoodSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
