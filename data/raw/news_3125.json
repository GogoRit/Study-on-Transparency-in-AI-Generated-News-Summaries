As a Christian conservative mother, I know that life is God-given,\u201d says Britt in the ad. \u201cI also know I\u2019ve had about enough of radical liberals lecturing us about following science while being OK with taking the lives of innocent babies in the ninth month of pregnancy. Where I\u2019m from, that\u2019s called murder \u2013 and this mama, I\u2019m not gonna take it. I approved this message because saving babies starts with sending more pro-life moms to the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\n\nWatch:\n\nIn a release announcing her TV advertisement, Britt presented scientific evidence supporting her stance that life begins at conception.\nThe candidate pointed to the fact that an unborn child\u2019s heartbeat can be detected as early as five weeks after conception. Additionally, she outlined that at the 15th week of pregnancy, a child inside the womb is capable of experiencing pain.\nBritt also cited quotes from national left-wing figures such as U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who each publicly declined to support a ban on third trimester abortions.\nIn a statement, Britt detailed her position that being pro-life includes advocating for policies that support and enhance the child\u2019s life \u201cfrom the womb to the workforce.\u201d\n\u201cEducation is the key to opportunity, which is at the heart of the American Dream. Each child in Alabama deserves to have a top-notch education so that they can land a good-paying job and support a family of their own right here at home one day,\u201d sated Britt. \u201cZip code should never define opportunity for any Alabamian, and I will work to ensure every child in our great state can thrive in a safe, strong community. I am a Mama on a Mission to make the future bright for our children and our children\u2019s children.\u201d\nDylan Smith is a staff writer for Yellowhammer News.
