Dickson, an anti-abortion advocate, supports a new policy that forbids using county roads to seek an abortion.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Mark Rogers for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\n\nMORTON \u2014 Commissioners in this rural Texas county that borders New Mexico on Thursday gave their unanimous blessing to a legally dubious policy that effectively outlaws travel on its local roads to seek an abortion.\nThe five-member panel in Cochran County, which sits about an hour west of Lubbock, agreed with Mark Lee Dickson, founder of the \u201csanctuary cities\u201d initiative, who said the ordinance was needed to finish the work started in the state\u2019s near-total ban, often referred to as Senate Bill 8.\n\u201cThis ordinance would close some of the loopholes that exist in this fight,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cIt\u2019s saying the roads, and the airport, could not be used for abortion trafficking into New Mexico.\u201d\nCounty Commissioner Eric Silhan introduced the ordinance to the county\u2019s governing body, saying it\u2019s a way to stand for \u201cthe people who can\u2019t speak for themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were more than a dozen people in the the county commissioners chambers, all appearing to be in support of the ordinance. Judy Deavours, the former mayor of neighboring Whiteface, spoke in favor of it. Whiteface was one of the first towns in the High Plains to pass the so-called sanctuary city ordinance in 2020, while Deavours was in office.\n\u201cWe have to finish what we started,\u201d Deavours said. \u201cThis is just wrapping it up, and if you vote for this, we\u2019ll have what we need.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related Story\n  \n\n\n A Texas county that borders New Mexico is the latest to consider an abortion travel ban \n\n\n\n\n        \n          Updated:\n        \n        Sept. 27, 2023\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nThe new travel ordinance in Cochran imposes penalties on people using the county\u2019s roads to knowingly transport someone seeking an abortion, but specifies that under no circumstances should the mother in the scenario be subject to prosecution or penalty. Similar to the sanctuary city ordinance, the act would be enforced through private civil lawsuits.\nCochran County joins a small group of other rural Texas counties that have passed these ordinances. It\u2019s the first that borders a state where abortion is legal. Abortion-rights supporters and legal scholars have said the policies are unenforceable and unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an effort, one by one by one, to create a statewide ban against travel to other states, literally creating a reproductive prison in the state of Texas,\u201d Wendy Davis, a former state senator who is now a senior adviser at Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, said on Wednesday.\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
