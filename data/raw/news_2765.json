She is the epitome of empowermentSchu MontgomeryOpinion contributorIt\u2019s always been about abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The assassination or attempted assassination of an otherwise well-qualified jurist to the Supreme Court\u00a0hinges on whether or not that judge is poised to overrule the infamous Roe v. Wade decision, legalizing abortion through all nine months of a woman\u2019s pregnancy.The \u201cborking\u201d (derived from the besmirching of Reagan-nominee Robert Bork in 1987) of one originalist-type judge after another remains the raison d\u2019e\u0302tre of Democrat ideologues. President Trump\u2019s pick for the next justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the 7th Circuit Court, stands in the crosshairs of many judicial activists, whose faux feminism foists the nebulous abortion \u201cchoice\u201d on the backs of countless dead babies.More:17 ways abortion could be outlawed in Kentucky with Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme CourtStellar recommendations from colleagues and former students, unmatched intellect, devoted mother of seven (two adopted from Haiti, another with Down\u00a0syndrome), and a principled commitment to interpreting the Constitution as written, not legislating from the bench \u2014\u00a0be damned!\u00a0This is the intolerable mindset of those vehemently opposed to the Barrett appointment.Reflecting on Judge Barrett\u2019s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \u201cJudge Barrett demonstrated that she has deep legal expertise, dispassionate judicial temperament, and sheer intellectual horsepower that the American people deserve to have on their Supreme Court.\u201dFor nearly a half-century, pro-life activists have had to endure the injustice of Roe \u2014\u00a0the death of nearly 65 million unborn babies, the wounding of countless women who regret their abortions \u2014\u00a0all in the name of a \u201cright\u201d nowhere found in the Constitution.The job of a judge \u2014\u00a0particularly on the nation\u2019s highest court \u2014\u00a0is to interpret the law, not make it.\u00a0Judge Barrett herself has insisted, \u201cA judge must apply the law as written, not as the judge wishes it were.\u201d She adds, \u201cJudges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\u201dEarlier:Kentucky AG Daniel Cameron signs letter asking Senate to quickly confirm Amy Coney BarrettRecently, a pro-life activist\u00a0was struck in the face by a self-described \u201cfeminist\u201d for carrying a sign that read,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe feminists are protesting a woman (Judge Barrett).\u201d\u00a0Autumn Schimmer later told the media\u00a0that \u201cwomen deserve better than abortion and are not empowered by killing their children.\u201dAmy Coney Barrett is the epitome of empowerment. She is a modern-day success story.\u00a0Bonnie Finnerty, education director for the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, calls Barrett, \u201cthe new face of feminism.\u201d Finnerty writes, \u201cHer (Barrett\u2019s) life itself is a message to present and future generations of women that true feminism is not an either/or proposition that limits your roles, but an and/both invitation to fulfill your potential.\u201dKristan Hawkins of Students for Life describes Barrett as \u201cone of us\u201d because she is a working mother. \u201cBy merit and hard work, she has advanced, and, if confirmed, she will become the first mother with school-age children to serve on the Supreme Court.\u201d\u00a0No one has a crystal ball as to how Judge Barrett, once on the high court, will rule on Roe.\u00a0While on the 7th\u00a0Circuit, she did vote to allow a hearing on a pro-life Indiana law requiring abortion centers to offer proper burial or cremation for babies killed in abortions. And she sided with another law allowing parents to be notified when their teenage daughter was considering an abortion.\u00a0In addition, as a law professor, Barrett professed the conviction of the value of human like from conception to natural death.\u00a0For millions of pro-life Americans, that\u2019s a laudable thing, not shameful.Instead of denigrating Judge Barrett, we should celebrate the fact that a decision (Roe) that was once dubbed an \u201cexercise in raw judicial power,\u201d could some day be returned to the individual states \u2014\u00a0in essence, to the people \u2014\u00a0as the rightful place for resolving longstanding, contentious social issues, like abortion.Opinion:The Supreme Court battle isn't really about the sanctity of judicial precedentSchu Montgomery is\u00a0a member of the board of directors for\u00a0Right to Life of Louisville.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Promote Your Event Licensing & Reprints Help Center Courier Journal Store Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Events Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\u00a9 2024 www.courier-journal.com.
