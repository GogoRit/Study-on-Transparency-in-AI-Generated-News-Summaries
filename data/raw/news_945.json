But now, eight months later, Planned Parenthood has dropped that legal challenge, saying \u201cit is clear we cannot depend on the courts to protect our constitutional rights.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the latest sign of how the legal protections for abortion have been weakened over the last year, thanks to a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court and a legal loophole identified by Texas politicians.\n\u201cThe Lubbock ordinance marks the first time that an abortion ban has survived court challenge in the United States since Roe v. Wade,\u201d Mark Lee Dickson, director of Right to Life of East Texas and the mastermind behind these city ordinances, wrote on his Facebook page.\nThe Lubbock ordinance uses a similar private enforcement mechanism as a state law, passed this year, that bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block enforcement of that law and has allowed only the narrowest of legal challenges to go forward.\nA federal district judge dismissed Planned Parenthood\u2019s lawsuit against the Lubbock ordinance in June, saying the provider had no standing to sue city officials because they don\u2019t enforce the law. Planned Parenthood has ceased providing abortions at its Lubbock clinic as a result of the ordinance, leaving the nearest clinic over 300 miles away \u2014 in Fort Worth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we have determined not to move forward with this appeal, this is not the end of our fight in Lubbock, and we continue to consider all legal options to challenge this unconstitutional local ban,\u201d said Ken Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, in a statement.\nIn a statement, the Lubbock City Council said it was \u201cpleased\u201d that Planned Parenthood had dropped the appeal.\n\u201cThe City Council promised to defend this ordinance in Court and is gratified to have done so successfully,\u201d the members said.\nA changed landscape\nThe \u201csanctuary city for the unborn\u201d movement started in East Texas in 2019, and since then, Dickson has helped more than 40 cities across the country pass these largely hypothetical ordinances. Lubbock, home to Texas Tech University, is the largest city to take up the cause \u2014 and the first with an abortion provider actually within city limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ordinance bans abortions from the moment of conception, with no exception for rape or incest, and is enforced by allowing \u201cthe unborn child\u2019s mother, father, grandparents, siblings and half-siblings\u201d to sue abortion providers.\nThe city ordinance relies on the same legal loophole as Texas\u2019 new, highly restrictive abortion law, which empowers private citizens, rather than public officials, to bring lawsuits against anyone who they say is \u201caiding or abetting\u201d in a prohibited abortion.\nThe state law, known as Senate Bill 8, differs from the city ordinance in that it allows abortions up until fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and allows anyone \u2014 whether they\u2019re personally connected to the abortion or not \u2014 to sue.\nBut both are designed to evade judicial review, giving abortion providers few avenues to challenge the laws in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Rosen, a constitutional law professor at Texas Tech, told The Texas Tribune when the ordinance passed that he believed the private lawsuits against abortion providers would ultimately fail \u2014 \u201cas long as Roe is good law.\u201d\nBut eight months later, Rosen said, \u201cit\u2019s a whole new ballgame.\u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to block enforcement of Texas\u2019 Senate Bill 8 and threw out most of the abortion providers\u2019 challenges. Abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy have been banned in Texas since Sept. 1.\nThe Supreme Court allowed only one legal challenge to proceed: against licensing officials who could discipline medical providers who perform prohibited abortions. That case is currently awaiting a hearing before the Texas Supreme Court, a process that is expected to take weeks or months to resolve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in December on a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi that could overturn Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the two Supreme Court cases that established a constitutional protection for pre-viability abortion. The court is expected to rule this summer.\nLambrecht, the Planned Parenthood CEO, said these cases show that legal challenges may no longer be the best course of action for abortion providers as \u201cabortion access hangs by a thread across the country.\u201d\nRosen, at Texas Tech, said the uncertainty surrounding Roe v. Wade means these city and state rules are even more difficult to navigate. Lubbock's ordinance has no statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for the Texas law is four years. \n\u201cIf [a private lawsuit] comes before the court, it seems to me that judges in Lubbock ought to throw it out based on Roe and Casey,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the plaintiff can wait until the Supreme Court makes its decision and if the court overturns Roe and Casey, then they can sue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has left abortion providers in a legal limbo, awaiting rulings from state courts, federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court to decide how and if they can resume abortions after about six weeks in Texas \u2014 or after conception in Lubbock.\n\u201cWe have said from the beginning that the abortion bans we have drafted are bulletproof from court challenge,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cWe are pleased that the litigation over Lubbock\u2019s ordinance has proven us right. We will continue our work to enact similar ordinances in other cities throughout the United States.\u201d\nDisclosure: Facebook, Planned Parenthood and Texas Tech University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
