(Sarah Miller/Idaho Statesman)\n\n\n\n\n\nIdaho\u2019s trigger law banning abortion in nearly all cases will go into effect on Aug. 25, and the heartbeat law allowing civil lawsuits against medical providers will go into effect immediately following an opinion from the Idaho Supreme Court on Friday evening.\u00a0\nThe opinion did not make a determination regarding the law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which is scheduled to take effect in one week.\u00a0\nThe decision comes after a hearing on Aug. 3 to address procedural questions about whether the trigger law\u2019s implementation should be paused, whether a pause on the heartbeat law should be lifted, and whether the two lawsuits should be consolidated and handed to a lower court for additional development.\n\u201cAs of August 19, 2022, the state will be able to criminally enforce the heartbeat act\u2019s prohibition on abortions and, in turn, carry out its duty to ensure the laws of Idaho are faithfully executed,\u201d the opinion said.\u00a0\nThe opinion is written by Justice Robyn Brody, and Chief Justice Richard Bevan and Justice Gregory Moeller concurred. Justice John Stegner concurred with the decision to consolidate the cases and not send them to district court, but dissented with the decision not to grant a stay and to vacate the pause on the heartbeat law. Stegner added that he would have also stayed enforcement of the six-week ban on abortions that will take effect Aug. 19.\u00a0\n\u201cNo one seriously disputes that the petitioners have established a showing of irreparable harm if a stay is not granted. That is all that is required under Idaho\u2019s rules of procedure,\u201d Stegner said. \u201cThe state and the Legislature\u2019s only argument that irreparable harm will not result is that the Idaho Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. This argument fails because it is premised on a decision we have not yet made. Staying the enforcement \u2026 would preserve the status quo that has been in effect for nearly 50 years and allow the parties the opportunity to craft their arguments and for us to consider the merits of these cases with the care and attention they deserve.\u201d\nJustice Colleen Zahn concurred with Stegner\u2019s dissenting opinion.\n  Justice Gregory W. Moeller asks for clarification from Alan Schoenfeld, a New York City lawyer who is part of the legal team representing Planned Parenthood, as the lawyer makes a case for procedures in two lawsuits pertaining to Idaho abortion laws: the state trigger law and the law allowing people to sue abortion providers at the Idaho Supreme Court in Boise on Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.\nPlanned Parenthood sued the state of Idaho in three separate cases: one regarding Idaho\u2019s law to ban nearly all abortions that will take effect Aug. 25; one similar ban that allows abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy that will take effect Aug. 19; and a Texas-style civil law that allows family members to sue medical providers who perform an abortion.\nThe court also decided to consolidate the three cases into one and retain its jurisdiction rather than sending it to a lower court. Justices in the Aug. 3 hearing signaled that the case could be remanded to a lower court if there was a need for testimony from physicians, for example.\nDuring the hearing earlier this month, attorneys for Planned Parenthood said the vagueness of the trigger law\u2019s language would lead to impossible situations for medical professionals to navigate, with no clarity on what would constitute a \u201cgood faith\u201d judgment that led to an abortion in a medical emergency.\u00a0\nAccording to the language of the trigger law, affirmative defenses are allowed for abortion in the case of rape, incest and to save the pregnant person\u2019s life. An affirmative defense is not the same as an exception, and instead means that if someone is prosecuted under the trigger law, those situations are acceptable as a defense in court. In the case of rape or incest, the victim must also provide a copy of a police report.\u00a0\nOral arguments on the now-consolidated case are scheduled to take place at 9 a.m. Sept. 29 in Boise.\n  A Bans Off Our Bodies rally attendee holds up a sign in front of the Idaho Capital Building on May 14, 2022.
