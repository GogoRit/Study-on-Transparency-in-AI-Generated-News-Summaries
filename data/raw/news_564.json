She didn\u2019t tell her family the real reason she\u2019d taken out a loan for 5,000 Brazilian reais ($1,000). Two days later and several hundred miles away, a 25-year-old woman packed a backpack in her one-bedroom Sao Paulo apartment and left for the airport with her boyfriend. Both women were bound for the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, seeking something forbidden in Brazil: an abortion.\u201cHaving a child that I don\u2019t want, and have no conditions to raise, and being obliged, would be torture,\u201d Sara told The Associated Press in Sao Paulo\u2019s airport as she prepared to sleep on a bench near the check-in counter the night before her connecting flight. \u201cWhat has helped me since I discovered I was pregnant is that I have a chance. I still have an alternative. That leaves me feeling more secure,\u201d said the woman, who lives in the interior Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte and asked that only her first name be used because of the stigma associated with abortion in Brazil. \n\nBoth women are part of a trend among Brazilian women without means who, to dodge risks and legal obstacles in Latin America\u2019s most populous country, have sought abortions elsewhere in the region. They didn\u2019t even need passports to enter Argentina, a fellow Mercosur nation. \nTheir trips came just two weeks before the Dec. 30 passage of landmark legislation legalizing abortion in Argentina \u2014 the largest Latin American nation to do so. It underscores not only how Argentina\u2019s progressive social policy diverges from Brazil\u2019s conservative one, but also the likelihood that more Brazilian women will seek abortions in the neighboring nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the changes in legislation in Latin America, women don\u2019t need to go to the U.S., don\u2019t need a visa to get an abortion,\u201d said Debora Diniz, a Latin American studies researcher at Brown University who has extensively studied abortion in the region. \n\n\u201cMore middle- and working-class women connected to feminist groups are now having access to something that is basically the story of wealthy women for a long time.\u201dSara said she couldn\u2019t risk the possibility of buying counterfeit abortion pills or undergoing a dangerous backdoor procedure in Brazil. She feared injury, death or a failed abortion resulting in complications. Getting caught could even mean jail. An Argentine health ministry protocol provided legal leeway for Sara\u2019s Dec. 14 abortion as long as she signed a statement citing the \u201chealth risk\u201d the pregnancy posed. The policy was based on the World Health Organization\u2019s definition of health: \u201cA state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d Still, some doctors refused abortions anyway, according to Dr. Viviana Mazur, who leads the sexual health group of the Argentine Federation of General Medicine. The new law allows abortions up to the 14th week of pregnancy.\u201cThe law will give more autonomy and dignity to women,\u201d Dr. Mazur said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t have to say \u2018please,\u2019 ask permission, nor forgiveness.\u201d\n\nBefore last week\u2019s vote, Argentine feminist groups had long pushed for legalized abortion in the homeland of Pope Francis, and they found common cause with President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who was elected in 2019 and introduced the bill.Activists demonstrated in front of Congress for weeks. Vice President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who presided over the debate in a legislature where more than 40% of lawmakers are women, announced the passage of the law. A crowd of several thousand outside burst into cheers and tearful hugs. There hasn\u2019t been any echo in Brazil\u2019s Congress, where about  15% of lawmakers are women. Brazilian law has remained virtually unchanged since 1940, permitting abortions only in cases of rape and danger to the woman\u2019s life. A Supreme Court ruling in 2012 also allowed abortions when the fetus has anencephaly. Since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, lawmakers have introduced at least 30 bills seeking to tighten laws, according to watchdog Women in Congress.\n\nBacked by conservatives and evangelicals, Bolsonaro has said that if Congress legalized abortion, he would veto. After Argentina\u2019s bill was passed, Bolsonaro said on Twitter that it would leave children \u201csubject to being reaped in their mother\u2019s wombs with consent of the State.\u201d He named evangelical pastor Damares Alves, who has said she opposes abortion even in cases of rape, to be his minister of women, families and human rights. After a 10-year-old was raped by her uncle and religious protesters besieged the hospital where her abortion was performed in August, Alves said the fetus should have been delivered by cesarean section. \u201cWe are working to provide a growing level of attention and protection to our pregnant women in vulnerable situations,\u201d Alves said in a written response to AP questions. \u201cNo one will want to leave the Brazil that we are building, much less to kill their kids.\u201d\n\nDiniz, the Brown University researcher, conducted a 2016 survey in Brazil that found one in five respondents had an abortion by age 40. The survey of 2,002 Brazilian women found higher rates of abortion among those with less education and income.In 2018, a health ministry official said the government estimated some 1 million induced abortions annually, with unsafe procedures causing more than 250,000 hospitalizations and 200 deaths.\u201cAbortion is a common experience in a woman\u2019s life. But at the same time, it is a sensitive political issue, and made sensitive by men in power,\u201d Diniz said.The Sao Paulo woman who traveled to Argentina for an abortion last month grew up in a Rio de Janeiro slum, or favela, where she frequently saw unplanned pregnancies derail women\u2019s lives, burdening them with responsibilities and making it even harder to have careers or social mobility. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get out of that reality,\u201d she said.She was able to leave the favela after landing a secure job, and is studying for a career in a medical field. In doing so, she became \u201cthe pride of my parents,\u201d said the woman, who asked that her name not be used because she feared professional consequences and because abortion is illegal in Brazil. Raised in a devout evangelical family, the woman said having an abortion in Brazil meant running afoul of both her God and national law. Of the two, she believed God could forgive her, so she looked abroad.That way, she said, \u201cno one will be able to accuse me of committing a crime.\u201dBoth women turned for help to the Brazilian non-profit Miles for Women\u2019s Lives, founded by screenwriter Juliana Reis and Rebeca Mendes, who became a pioneer in 2017 when she publicly announced she would travel outside Brazil for an abortion. The group helped the first woman travel abroad in November 2019, and another 59 had followed by the end of last year. The total includes 16 women who went to Argentina in November and December. It raises about 4,000 reais ($750) monthly from crowdfunding and pays travel costs for about one-fifth of the women, Reis said. Efforts are focused on providing moral support and helping women navigate the unfamiliar countries and connect with clinics abroad. The group has received some 1,500 requests for assistance, whether within Brazil or abroad. Some asked about neighboring Uruguay without knowing its law applies only to residents, Reis said. The only other places in Latin America where abortion is legal are Cuba, Guyana, French Guiana and parts of Mexico. Now that Argentina has approved legalization, the group expects to provide more Brazilian women with an affordable, safe and legal option at their doorstep. Reis said the group has 13 women heading to Argentina in January, and she expects travel there will become more commonplace, particularly from southern Brazil. \u201cOur operations have reached an intense level because many people believe it is no longer tolerable to keep hiding this in the closet and figuring out workarounds,\u201d Reis said. \u201cFor me, this is the start of a change.\u201dAfter her abortion, Sara said in Buenos Aires she felt relieved, and even contemplated sharing the experience with her family. \u201cI know women who have needed to do clandestine abortions,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Brazil \u2014 and everywhere \u2014 there are women who need this support.\u201d___ Pollastri reported from Sao Paulo.
