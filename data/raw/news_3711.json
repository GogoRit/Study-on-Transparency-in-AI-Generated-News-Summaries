Wade.\u00a0Like Republicans in tight races across the country, Tyler Kistner is now downplaying his past remarks on abortion.\u00a0\nKistner doesn\u2019t list abortion as an issue on his campaign website. In 2020, Kistner\u2019s site said he was \u201c100% pro-life.\u201d\u00a0\nKistner\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to the Reformer\u2019s inquiry about whether Kistner\u2019s anti-abortion stance would be a priority if elected this time around. If Kistner is elected, he may have an opportunity to vote on a national abortion ban if Republicans take the House.\u00a0\nThe Prior Lake Republican\u2019s abortion views differ greatly from Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, whom Kistner is attempting to unseat in a rematch of the 2020 election.\n\u201cAs a father and person of faith, I\u2019m 100% pro-life,\u201d Kistner\u2019s 2020 website stated. \u201cLife is a sacred gift. Today we are even seeing politicians and legislatures approve abortion up to birth \u2014 now is the time to fight and be an advocate.\u201d\nOn a conservative radio show in 2020, Kistner said if elected he would prioritize boosting the economy and his anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment stance during his first 100 days in office.\nWhen asked by the host of Northern Alliance Radio if \u201cthere is anything people can expect from you in terms of policy positions in your first 100 days in office,\u201d Kistner said his first concern would be the economy after its stagnant performance due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cAnd, you know, with me you get someone who is strongly pro-life and then also pro-Second Amendment. I\u2019ll never let anyone infringe on those rights,\u201d Kistner said.\nKistner indicated earlier this summer in a questionnaire that he would vote to uphold \u201cpro-life law or policy\u201d that\u2019s in effect if he is elected. In a Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life questionnaire, Kistner said he supported limiting taxpayer funding for abortion. He said he would also support legislation that advances an \u201cincremental approach\u201d towards banning abortion, which is a \u201cstrategic plan for creating a pro-life nation,\u201d according to the survey.\nPublic backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion has Republicans in other purple regions scrambling to adjust their positions. Minnesota Republican nominee for governor Scott Jensen has changed his stance on abortion; his latest position is that \u201cabortion\u2019s not on the ballot.\u201d\nKistner said this summer that he does support abortion rights if the mother\u2019s life is in danger, and in cases of rape or incest. Craig earlier this summer ran a television ad saying that Kistner didn\u2019t support exceptions, which outlets fact-checked and found untrue.\nCraig beat Kistner narrowly in 2020, winning by 9,580 votes. This year, the race for Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District is among the 32 U.S. House seats that are the most competitive in the country, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRepublican congressional candidate Tyler Kistner is \u2018pro-life\u2019 but no longer vocal about it\nby Michelle Griffith, Minnesota Reformer September 20, 2022\nRepublican congressional candidate Tyler Kistner is \u2018pro-life\u2019 but no longer vocal about it\nby Michelle Griffith, Minnesota Reformer September 20, 2022\n The Republican nominee for Minnesota\u2019s 2nd Congressional District seat has touted his \u201c100% pro-life\u201d stance and said that if elected, abortion would be a top priority.\nBut that was in 2020, before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
