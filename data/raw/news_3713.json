Houck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie, said that the FBI showed up in 15 vehicles with a 25-man SWAT team. She also said the team members pointed guns at her family. But the FBI says they showed up with only 15 to\u00a020 agents, without a SWAT team, and that the agents did not point their weapons at the family. According to the FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act, it is a federal crime to use force, the threat of force, or physical obstruction to stop someone\u2019s access to abortion or against an abortion worker.\nWho is Houck? The 48-year-old Catholic man co-founded and serves as president for The King\u2019s Men, a ministry that seeks to spiritually mentor young Catholic men. His wife told LifeSiteNews that Houck would drive to Philadelphia to speak in front of abortion centers for six to eight hours. Prosecutors indicted him for the assault of a 72-year-old Planned Parenthood escort. Houck\u2019s wife said that he was just trying to defend his son and that he shoved away someone who was shouting at him.\nDig deeper: Listen to my discussion with\u00a0Carolina Lumetta about how pro-life businesses have faced backlash online and in-person since the fall of Roe v.
