\n\n\n\n\n\nA lawyer for Gov. Kim Reynolds asked the Iowa Supreme Court Tuesday to reinstate Iowa\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law and allow the state to enforce it.Abortion is currently legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.If the Court allows the law to take effect, it would ban abortions after cardiac activity is detected. That can be as early as six weeks of pregnancy, or about two weeks after a missed period. The law has exceptions for rape, incest, preserving the life of the pregnant person, and fetal abnormalities that are incompatible with life.Reynoldssigned the bill into law in 2018, but it was blocked by the Polk County District Courtand never enforced. At the time, legal protections for abortion rights did not allow for such a strict abortion ban.That changed last June, when the Iowa Supreme Court ruled there is no fundamental right to abortion subject to strict scrutiny, and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. After that, Reynolds asked the courts to reconsider the \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d ban.\u201cWhat the legislature did in 2018 in enacting the fetal heartbeat law, it\u2019s perfectly consistent with both constitutions,\u201d said Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Chris Schandevel, who was representing the state Tuesday. \u201cBecause there is no fundamental right to abortion.\u201dSchandevel argued the Court has no choice but to allow the state to enforce the law because of last year\u2019s court decisions.Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Iowa argued there is no legal basis for reviving a law that was unconstitutional when it passed and was then permanently blocked by a court four years ago. Their attorneys argued Reynolds had 30 days to appeal the injunction that was issued in 2019, but she declined to do so.\u201cThis abortion ban was dangerous, cruel and unconstitutional at the time that it was passed,\u201d said ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen. \u201cAnd it remains dangerous, cruel and unconstitutional today.\u201dPlanned Parenthood attorney Peter Im said the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year left in place the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard for abortion rights, which would mean the abortion ban is still unconstitutional.Schandevel disagreed and said the \u201crational basis\u201d test now applies, which would open the door to banning abortion in Iowa.\u201cThe legislature clearly has a legitimate and\u2026compelling interest in protecting and preserving fetal life,\u201d he said.Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said the law would have a devastating impact on Iowans.\u201cIf this 2018 law is resurrected, it would block about 98% of abortions in Iowa, forcing people to travel out of state, to self-manage their abortions outside of the medical system, or be forced into forced pregnancy and birth,\u201d she said.Richardson said maternal mortality rates will continue to get worse, especially for people of color, as more states ban abortion. She said Planned Parenthood is preparing to implement the abortion ban in case it becomes enforceable in Iowa.The Court is expected to issue an opinion by the end of June.Reynolds, a Republican, appointed five of the seven justices on the Iowa Supreme Court.\u201cI remain optimistic that the Iowa Supreme Court will allow the fetal heartbeat bill to take effect as the Iowa Constitution requires,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cSince the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, decision-making power has been returned to the states. Our citizens and their elected officials have chosen to promote life and end abortion at a heartbeat, with exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.\u201dMedical experts have criticized the term \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d in the context of abortion bans, because a pregnancy is not medically considered a fetus until about 10 weeks after the person\u2019s last period. Cardiac activity can be detected as early as 6 weeks from the last period, when the pregnancy is still in the embryonic stage and the heart is not fully developed.Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said Democrats trust Iowans to make their own choices about their own bodies and futures.\u201cDespite years of legal precedent and wide public support across political affiliations for reproductive freedom in Iowa, an extreme faction of anti-choice Republicans won\u2019t stop until they have a total ban on abortion,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nState Government News\nKim ReynoldsIowa Supreme CourtAbortion\n\n\n\n\n \nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatarina Sostaric\n\n\n                \n                    Katarina Sostaric is IPR's State Government Reporter \n                \n            \n\n\n                        See stories by Katarina Sostaric\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPR's weekly newsletter that helps you make sense of politics and policies.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name  *\n\n\n\n\nLast Name \n\n\n\nNewsletters \n\n\nChatter - Your weekend update\n\n\n\nDaily Digest - Local and national updates every weekday\n\n\n\nPolitical Sense - For what's happening in politics\n\n\n\nAll Access - Your connection to Iowa's music scene\n\n\n\nGarden Variety - Gardening for green thumbs and beginners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews from NPR\n\n\nThreats, debt and Trump's advances: 'Stormy' doc examines the life of Stormy Daniels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews from NPR\n\n\nSo long, Stumpy.
