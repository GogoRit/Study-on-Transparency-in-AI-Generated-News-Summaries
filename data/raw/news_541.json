Chris Smith, R-N.J., introduced the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the House; the act would ban most abortions after 20 weeks gestation\u2014the age when, according to some medical experts, unborn babies can begin feeling pain.\n\u201cPain, we all dread it. We avoid it. We even fear it. And we all go to extraordinary lengths to mitigate its severity and its duration for ourselves,\u201d Smith stated on Monday. \u201cYet every day, a whole segment of human beings is being subjected to painful\u2014and deadly\u2014procedures.\u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has also introduced a 20-week abortion ban in the Senate. Both Graham and Smith have introduced similar legislation in previous congresses.\nJoining Smith were 142 members of the House, who co-sponsored his bill on Monday.\nThe House in 2015 and again in 2017 passed a 20-week abortion ban, but the legislation did not pass the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Democrats having held control of the House since Jan., 2019, Smith\u2019s legislation is not expected to pass the House.\nAnother pro-life bill\u2014the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act\u2014was introduced in the previous Congress yet failed to receive a vote. The bill required that babies surviving botched abortion attempts receive necessary care and be transported to a hospital. After Democratic leadership blocked debate on the act, members circulated a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d to force consideration of the bill by the entire chamber, but the petition fell 13 signatures short of the 218 signatures necessary to force consideration.\nPro-life groups have told CNA that they are working to elect a pro-life majority to the House in 2022, to enable passage of pro-life legislation.\nPain-capable bills have also been introduced in the states of Florida and Montana. Gov. Greg Gianforte, R, of Montana has promised to sign the bill if it is passed by the state legislature.\n\n\n\n\n\nDilation and evacuation is the commonly-used abortion procedure for the second trimester. Smith said that the gruesome procedure \u201cinvolves cutting and dismembering the child\u2019s fragile body including severing his or her arms and legs. Until rendered unconscious or dead, the baby feels every cut.\u201d\nSmith cited Dr. Colleen Malloy, assistant professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Division of Neonatology, who testified before the House Judiciary Committee in 2012 that unborn babies are already moving, kicking, and reacting at 20 weeks.\n\u201cIn other words, there are children the same age who, in utero, can be painfully killed by abortion who have been born and are now being given lifesaving assistance,\u201d Malloy said.\nDoctors also administer anesthesia to unborn children when conducting treatments, Smith said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Sen. Graham\u2019s 20-week abortion ban\u2014named \u201cMicah\u2019s Law\u201d\u2014failed to gather the necessary 60 votes for passage. The bill was named after Micah Pickering, who was born prematurely at 22 weeks and who survived after spending four months in the neonatal intensive care unit.\nPickering\u2019s mother told CNA at the time that the legislation \u201cis not just [about] Micah, but is every little baby that could ever be born.\u201d\nWhile the vote was largely party-line, two Democratic senators \u2014Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., \u2014 broke with their party to support Graham\u2019s bill, while Republican Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, opposed it.\n\n\nKeywords: \npain capable unborn child protection act\n20 week abortion ban\nhouse of representatives\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Key Provisions in New Pain-Capable Abortion Ban: NRLC\n\n\n\n\nPeter Jesserer Smith\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling Their Agony: 11th U.S. State Passes Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Legislation\n\nAccording to a leading pro-life advocate, the drive for such bills \u2018brings the unborn baby back into the abortion debate.\u2019\n\n\nBRIAN FRAGA\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Step in Fighting \u2018Roe v.
