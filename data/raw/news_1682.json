PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Gov. Tim Walz enshrined the right to abortion and other reproductive health care into Minnesota statutes Tuesday, signing a bill meant to ensure that the state\u2019s existing protections remain in place no matter who sits on future courts.Democratic leaders took advantage of their new control of both houses of the Legislature to rush the bill through in the first month of the 2023 legislative session. They credit the backlash against the U.S. Supreme Court decision last summer to reverse Roe v. Wade for their takeover of the state Senate and for keeping their House majority in a year when Republicans expected to make gains.\u201cAfter last year\u2019s landmark election across this country, we\u2019re the first state to take legislative action to put these protections in place,\u201d Walz said at a signing ceremony flanked by over 100 lawmakers, providers and other advocates who worked to pass the bill.\n\nAbortion rights were already protected under a 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court decision known as Doe v. Gomez, which held that the state Constitution protects abortion rights. And a district court judge last summer declared unconstitutional several restrictions that previous Legislatures had put in place, including a 24-hour waiting period and a parental notification requirement for minors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Minnesota Supreme Court Justice announces retirement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFBI calls bomb threats that led to brief lockdowns and evacuations of some state capitols a hoax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponents decried the bill as \u201cextreme,\u201d saying that it and other fast-tracked legislation will leave Minnesota with essentially no restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leaders of the Senate and House GOP minorities, Sen. Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks, and Rep. Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, urged Walz in a letter Monday to veto the bill, saying the Democratic majorities rejected dozens of amendments that Republican lawmakers proposed as guardrails, including prohibitions on third-trimester abortions except to save the patient\u2019s life.\n\nBut the White House welcomed Walz\u2019s signature on the bill, noting that Minnesota is the first state Legislature to codify protections into law this year. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that voters also turned out for ballot initiatives to defend access to abortion in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont.\u201cWhile Congressional Republicans continue their support for extreme policies including a national abortion ban, the President and Vice President are calling on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law,\u201d Jean-Pierre said in a statement. \u201cUntil then, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue its work to protect access to abortion and support state leaders in defending women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201dWhile the new law will have little immediate further impact on access to abortion in Minnesota, the governor, legislative leaders and sponsors of the bill said it provides a critical new layer of protection in case the composition of the state courts someday changes, as it did on the U.S. Supreme Court before it struck down Roe v. Wade.\u201cTo Minnesotans, know that your access to reproductive health, and your right to make your own health care decisions, are preserved and protected,\u201d Walz said. \u201cAnd because of this law, that won\u2019t change with the political winds and the makeup of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe House passed the bill 69-65 less than two weeks ago, and party discipline held firm during a 15-hour debate in the Senate that ended in a 34-33 vote early Saturday.\u201cFundamentally this legislation is about who decides,\u201d said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park. \u201cWho should be legally entitled to make reproductive health care decisions for an individual. ... It can\u2019t be decided by politicians. It can\u2019t be decided by judges.\u201dAbortion is currently considered illegal at all stages of pregnancy, with various exceptions, in 13 states, including neighboring Wisconsin and South Dakota. Bans in several states, including neighboring North Dakota, remain on hold for the moment pending court challenges. Because of restrictions elsewhere, Minnesota has seen a surge of pregnant patients coming to the state for abortions. \n\nMinnesota\u2019s new law is named the \u201cPRO Act,\u201d short for \u201cProtect Reproductive Actions.\u201d It establishes that \u201cevery individual has a fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about the individual\u2019s own reproductive health\u201d including abortion and contraception.There are other bills to protect abortion rights in the Legislature\u2019s pipeline as well, including one to delete the statutory restrictions that the district court declared unconstitutional last summer. It\u2019s meant to safeguard against those limits being reinstated if that ruling is overturned on appeal. Hortman said she expected House floor votes to approve them as early as next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
