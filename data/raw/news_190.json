Credit: Maggie Lee\nBy Maggie Lee\nA federal judge says a Georgia law that attempts to ban all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy is unconstitutional. Gov. Brian Kemp says the state will appeal to a higher court.\n\u201c\u2026 [P]rohibiting a woman\u00a0 from terminating her pregnancy upon the detection of a fetal heartbeat, constitutes a pre-viability abortion ban,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones of the Northern District of Georgia.\nAnd as such, it infringes on a woman\u2019s right to get an abortion before a fetus is viable, he wrote, and declared a 2019 Georgia abortion law unconstitutional.\nThe part of the law that defined an embryo as a natural person was also unconstitutional, according to the July 13 order.\nIt\u2019s a huge win for plaintiffs, which include SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective.\n\u201cThis win is tremendous,\u201d said SisterSong Executive Director Monica Simpson in a press release. \u201cAnd it is also makes a very bold statement. No one should have to live in a world where their bodies and reproductive decision making is controlled by the state. And we will continue to work to make sure that is never a reality in Georgia or anywhere else.\u201d\nSo Georgia still has the law it had before 2019: abortion is allowed up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.\nKemp announced via Twitter his intent to appeal the ruling.\n\u201cWe will appeal the Court\u2019s decision. Georgia values life, and we will keep fighting for the rights of the unborn,\u201d Kemp wrote.\nOpponents of the 2019 law had already announced they would oppose it, even before Kemp signed it. And they predicted success. Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, said at the time that the law violated 50 years of precedent.\nGeorgia is one of several Republican-controlled states to try and ban abortion once fetal \u201ccardiac activity\u201d is detectable. That\u2019s at about six or seven weeks of pregnancy. The bills are called in shorthand \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills, though the embryonic heart is not fully formed at six weeks and the sound is not that of a heart.\nThe federal court in Georgia is only the latest among several to strike down heartbeat bills.\nSo far, the state has spent $307,187.80 for attorney\u2019s fees and related expenses. If the state ultimately loses, it could be liable for the plaintiffs\u2019 court costs as well.\nDocuments:\nJuly 13, 2020 order by U.S. District Court for Northern Georgia in SisterSong et. al. v. Kemp\nThis story has been updated with the state\u2019s court costs so far.\n\nRelated\n \n\nTagged: Abortion,\u00a0ACLU,\u00a0Brian Kemp,\u00a0court,\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0HB 481,\u00a0Legislature,\u00a0SisterSong,\u00a0unconstitutional \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaggie Lee\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaggie Lee is a freelance reporter who's been covering Georgia and metro Atlanta government and politics since 2008.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore by Maggie Lee\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tLeave a comment\t\t\n\n\nCancel replyYour email address will not be published.
