The bill states it would make an exemption for saving the life of the pregnant person, but that was debated at the Statehouse on Wednesday.\nThe Human Life Protection Act, House Bill 598, is a trigger ban. If this bill passes the Legislature and Gov. Mike DeWine signs it, it would only come into effect if the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) \u201cwholly or partially upholds a state\u2019s authority to prohibit abortion.\u201d For this, the bill would require either an issuance of a U.S. Supreme Court opinion or an adoption of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nRoe v. Wade was the 1973 landmark decision in which the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution protects a pregnant woman\u2019s liberty to choose to have an abortion. The Supreme Court is set to hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2014 which is Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban.\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade by upholding Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, then HB 598 would immediately begin.\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Republican from Loveland, gave her sponsor testimony and answered questions for an hour.\nThe bill would\n\nProhibits a person from purposely causing an abortion by using a \u201csubstance\u201d or an \u201cinstrument\u201d or other means.\nMakes criminal abortion a felony in the fourth degree.\nProhibits any person from making, selling or advertising tools to cause an abortion.\nMakes \u201cpromoting\u201d abortion a first-degree misdemeanor.\nCreates the crime of abortion manslaughter, which is when a person takes the life of a child born from an attempted abortion who is alive when removed from the pregnant person\u2019s uterus.\nMakes abortion manslaughter a felony of the first degree.\n\nThe penalties\n\nMinimum of four to seven years and a maximum of 25 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000 for abortion manslaughter.\nMinimum of one-half to two years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $2,500 for criminal abortion.\n\nHowever, the bill does grant immunity from prosecution for abortion manslaughter, criminal abortion or promoting abortion to the person who attempted an abortion or succeeded in an abortion. This individual would also be able to sue for wrongful death for violation of crimes of abortion manslaughter, criminal abortion or promoting abortion.\n\n\nTODAY \u2014 \nRep. Jean Schmidt (R-Loveland) is testifying now on her \u2018Enact Human Life Protection Act.\u2019 \nThis bill is an abortion trigger ban. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, Ohio would immediately ban abortion. Doctors found guilty of performing them would lose their license. @WEWS pic.twitter.com/wItbqH7yac\n\u2014 Morgan Trau (@MorganTrau) April 27, 2022\n\n\nThe bill also allows for an affirmative defense to a criminal abortion charge, but only if the physician performed or induced the abortion, or attempted to do so, under the determination that it was necessary to prevent the individual\u2019s death or a serious risk to the pregnant individual.\nThis would be an \u201cexemption,\u201d according to Schmidt. In the case of a medical emergency for the pregnant person, two doctors not professionally related must sign off on the abortion. Unless it is determined the mother is at risk of death or injury, they must take every precaution to save \u201cboth the child and the mother.\u201d If the premature child is alive, the doctors must provide care for it.\n\u201cThe goal is to save both lives and treat both patients,\u201d Schmidt said in her testimony.\nDemocrats were ready to ask questions, with most of them coming from Reps. Richard Brown (D-Canal Winchester), Dr. Beth Liston (D-Dublin) and Tavia Galonski (D-Akron). However, Majority Floor Leader Rep. Bill Seitz (R-Cincinnati) jumped in.\nThe intense back and forth between Brown and Schmidt revolved around the lack of exemptions for rape and incest.\n\u201cSo under this bill, if a 13-year-old girl, let\u2019s say, was raped by a serial rapist, broke into her house, or maybe more likely raped by a family member, which occurs frequently \u2014 unfortunately, this bill would require this 13-year-old to carry this felons fetus to term, regardless of any emotional or psychological damage or trauma that may be inflicted upon this 13-year-old girl to deliver this, felons a fetus. Is that right?\u201d he asked.\nSchmidt responded and said that rape is a difficult issue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that it happens, but there\u2019s an opportunity for that woman, no matter how young or old she is,\u201d she said.\nThe opportunity \u2014 which would be the only option \u2014 is to deliver that baby.\n\u201cShe can choose to raise the child, she can choose to give that child to a loving family member or to give it to someone else \u2014 and that child can grow up and be something magnificent, a wonderful family person, cure cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because you have emotional scars doesn\u2019t give you the right, right to take the life.\u201d\nBrown followed up.\n\u201cYou earlier said every life is important \u2014 the life of a 13-year-old girl in my hypothetical is important,\u201d he added.\nHe then brings up the pregnant juvenile going to middle school, saying that kids are \u201cmean, they\u2019re evil and they\u2019re going to say all kinds of bad things to their classmate about her condition.\u201d\n\u201cI think this girl has rights every bit as much as the zygote that has rights under your bill,\u201d he said. \u201cThis girl has rights, and I don\u2019t believe we can lose sight of the rights of the person who was raped.\u201d\n\n\nYou don\u2019t typically see this \u2014\nRep. @CincySeitz (R-Cincinnati) & Richard Brown (D-Canal Winchester) are both questioning Schmidt on \u201cunclear language\u201d in the bill, even acknowledging how rare it is that they agree.@Liston4Ohio is also jumping in, same as @RepGalonski. @WEWS pic.twitter.com/vctGsDUOEt\n\u2014 Morgan Trau (@MorganTrau) April 27, 2022\n\n\nSupporters of the bill, like Ohio Right to Life, say just because someone commits a crime, doesn\u2019t mean we should have the right to \u201cpurposely\u201d end a life.\n\u201cThey can live a dignified life that shows them that they can overcome certain circumstances,\u201d Elizabeth Whitmarsh, a spokesperson for the organization, said. \u201cThat might seem impossible in the moment, but they\u2019re able to get through it.\u201d\nPro-Choice Ohio, who was also at the hearing, said everyone should be entitled to make their own health care decisions without government mandates.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what that person\u2019s reason is for having an abortion, they need to have access to abortion in their community without stigma, judgment or delay,\u201d Jaime Miracle, deputy director for the group, said. \u201cThey need the abortion that they have decided is best for them and their family.\u201d\nAnother argument that was brought up by legislators on each side was how the bill was too open for interpretation.\nListon, a physician, lead the questioning on the medical concerns. She started by bringing up the language in the bill surrounding the \u201cexemption\u201d for an individual whose health is in danger.\n\u201cHow I read this is that a physician could defend themselves against a murder charge with what\u2019s called an affirmative defense, in the case of it being life-threatening if they follow provisions A, B, C, D, E and F, which includes a lot of different things, made a lot of documentation, a lot of provisions on what\u2019s available at a facility,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cPhysicians cannot terminate a pregnancy \u2014 period. They can defend themselves from it, from a charge in the setting of life-threatening complications if they follow these specific steps is.\u201d\nSchmidt didn\u2019t answer the question, but rather reiterated the language in the bill.\nListon continued on to give examples of different circumstances in pregnancy that will result in the death of a pregnant person, such as partial or incomplete molar pregnancies, severe preeclampsia and ectopic pregnancies.\n\u201cThe longer one waits before terminating the pregnancy, the more risk there is to a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no good outcome here \u2014 there\u2019s no live birth.\u201d\nListon then brings up how there are no non-ICUs in the world that can resuscitate before 22 weeks. For extreme preemies, there are only three in Ohio \u2014 Columbus, Cincinnati and Cleveland.\nThat, mixed with needing to get two different doctors that aren\u2019t affiliated with each other, can make this incredibly difficult to actually get an abortion, Liston said.\n\u201cThe three hospitals that you mentioned are level one trauma centers,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cWhen you are a traumatic patient, it is the obligation of the rescue unit to take you to the most appropriate place and those would be, in certain cases, level one centers.\u201d\nListon said they don\u2019t want it to get to the level of an emergency life flight.\n\u201cThat is a really difficult gray line that\u2019s being created with the threat of jail to doctors that are working with their patients,\u201d she said.\nShe then raises a hypothetical about breast cancer patients and how she wouldn\u2019t be able to get treatment because the interacting drugs could be seen as \u201cabortion\u201d drugs.\n\u201cRepresentative Liston, I\u2019m not a doctor,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cBut I have read stories of women that have had breast cancer, gone through the treatment and have had normal children. So I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\nThe other main line of questioning was bipartisan confusion on what the trigger for the bill actually was.\nBrown and Seitz went back and forth, agreeing on the same question to ask for clarification. Brown had asked a question about what happens when SCOTUS doesn\u2019t totally overturn Roe v. Wade, but still makes an assertion on it.\n\n\nYes, @GovMikeDeWine will sign the Human Life Protection Act, #HB598, if it passes GA.\nAfter my interview with Ohio Right to Life, I asked spokesman @DanTierney. He told me DeWine recently filled out a campaign survey for them, agreeing to sign a bill like this.\nMORE\u2b07\ufe0f @WEWS pic.twitter.com/il6ppnmq28\n\u2014 Morgan Trau (@MorganTrau) April 27, 2022\n\n\n\u201cRanking member Brown and I don\u2019t often agree on very much, but I want to go back to his question,\u201d Seitz said. \u201cSo, if the Supreme Court says only that the 15-week ban imposed by Mississippi is constitutional and Mississippi can ban abortions after 15 weeks \u2014 I think Representative Brown\u2019s question, and I kind of agree with him if this is what it means, I would say that your bill would kick in to ban all abortions, even those at less than 15 weeks.\u201d\nHe continued that Ohio has already banned abortion after a heartbeat can be detected at six weeks. He then asked if Schmidt was following his logic, and she said: \u201cin part.\u201d\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court, in part, returns to the states the question of whether to ban abortion after 15 weeks, then your bill should be clarified to say the trigger has not been met,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you agree with that?\u201d\n\u201cI would be amenable to that kind of an amendment if that clarification is needed,\u201d she said.\nDeWine\u2019s spokesperson told News 5 that the governor agreed to sign this bill, or a bill similar to this, in a campaign survey to Ohio Right to Life.
