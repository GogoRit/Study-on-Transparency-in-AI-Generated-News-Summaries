However, Governor Sununu\u2019s barrage of attacks on abortion is perverting the American ideals of liberty and freedom.\nAs we enter 2022, the future of reproductive rights is more uncertain than ever with Roe v. Wade on the line at the Supreme Court. It\u2019s clear that we must take action to protect abortion access now - before it\u2019s too late. That\u2019s why I\u2019m urging the New Hampshire Legislature to repeal Governor Sununu\u2019s abortion ban and pass the Access to Abortion-Care Act.\nOn Jan. 1, Governor Sununu\u2019s abortion ban went into effect, banning abortion at 24 weeks with no exceptions for fatal fetal diagnoses, rape, or incest. The law criminalizes doctors, eviscerating the patient and provider relationship. The law also mandates ultrasounds for all abortion care at any stage of pregnancy - even if it is not medically necessary, which is an outrageous governmental overreach.\nInstead of entering a new year when the clock struck midnight, it felt like we were traveling back in time. New Hampshire should be focused on increasing access to reproductive health care, not stripping Granite Staters of the right to freely make decisions about their own bodies.\nFully repealing Governor Sununu\u2019s abortion ban and passing the Access to Abortion-Care Act are essential steps to protecting Granite Staters\u2019 bodily autonomy. The Access to Abortion-Care Act provides critical protections to ensure that Granite State women and families can work with their doctors to get the health care they need in the majority of situations.\nContact your state senator and representatives today and urge them to repeal Governor Sununu\u2019s abortion ban and ultrasound mandate and pass the Access to Abortion-Care Act.\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is controlled and operated by Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund works to advance access to sexual health care and defend reproductive rights.\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\nTake Action\nToggle Navigation\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nVolunteer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
