The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has begun to relocate refugees from transit centres to a displacement settlement in Um Raquba, where UNFPA is working with partners to provide critical services.\nA majority of the relocated refugees are women and children.\n\u201cI have seen men are slaughtered in front of my own eyes. I cannot forget that,\u201d one young woman told UNFPA officials at Um Raquba during a needs assessment.\n\u201cI ran from home when the gunfire was going off. I still don\u2019t know where my father and brothers are.\u201d\nFear, trauma, sexual violence\nMany of the women and girls are fearful for their safety. Vulnerability to gender-based violence often increases during humanitarian crises.\nThe majority of refugees in Um Raquba are women and children.\u00a0\u00a9 UNFPA Sudan/Sufian Abdul-Mouty\u201cWhen I left, I fled with seven children. We travelled for four nights on foot across the bush and forest. During day, we hid,\u201d one 37-year-old refugee told UNFPA. \u201cI have two daughters, 20 and 18 years old. I cannot sleep soundly because I have anxiety over the safety of my daughters.\u201d\nAdditionally, refugees lack safe toilets and private shower facilities. Women and girls have resorted to walking some distance from the settlement to relieve themselves in the open, exposing them to potential violence.\nUNFPA and partners are stepping in to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. Psychological first aid and trauma counselling are urgently needed. UNFPA is working with UNHCR to integrate these services into programmes for survivors of gender-based violence.\nReproductive health needs unmet\nWomen\u2019s reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. The nearest referral health facility able to provide post-rape treatment or emergency obstetric care is about 40 minutes from Um Raquba.\n\u201cOne woman lost her baby after nine months of pregnancy due to a lack of services,\u201d said Massimo Diana, UNFPA\u2019s Representative in Sudan. The woman had arrived at the health centre too late to deliver safely.\n\u201cNo woman should have to go through this, and we are working to ensure services are available to save lives,\u201d he added.\nSupplies are brought into Um Raquba settlement.\u00a9 UNFPA Sudan/Sufian Abdul-MoutyUNFPA estimates that, of the newly arrived refugees in Sudan, more than 700 are likely to be pregnant, and there may be around 150 survivors of gender-based violence in need of assistance. This estimate is based on the Minimum Initial Service Package for Reproductive Health in Crisis calculations wherein around 2 per cent of women of reproductive age are expected to experience sexual violence.\nMore than 7,500 refugees are estimated to be women of reproductive age.\n\u201cThe first day I arrived in this camp, I began menstruating,\u201d one 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA. \u201cOne day, I stayed wearing stained, bloody clothes. Then I sold my only valuable \u2013 my Android phone \u2013 to buy underwear, cotton and soap to deal with menstruation.\u201d\nUNFPA responding\nUNFPA is working to establish safe spaces for these women and girls, where they can find psychosocial support and referrals to health and other services.\nWith partners, UNFPA is also working to distribute dignity kits, which contain hygiene supplies such as sanitary napkins, clothing, soap, undergarments and other necessities.\nUNFPA is also providing clean delivery kits, which contain basic supplies to facilitate a safe childbirth, including antiseptic cream, a razor to cut the umbilical cord, a sterile sheet for a woman to deliver on, and a blanket to warm the baby. More comprehensive emergency reproductive health kits are being provided to health workers and to clinics that are being set up on-site.\nBut more assistance is needed.\nPartners, including the UN Refugee Agency, estimate the number of refugees could rise to 200,000 in the coming six months.\n\u201cWith many more people expected to cross the border, additional support will be critical to meet rising needs,\u201d said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA's Executive Director.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nA displaced girl in Syria finds safety and support\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\u201cGaza is at breaking point\u201d: Health workers and patients describe an unfolding\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nAfter 13 years of crisis, we hear from female health workers in Syria leading\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
