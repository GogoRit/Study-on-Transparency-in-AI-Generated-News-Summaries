I\u2019m supposed to give birth to children at all costs. Even if I die after two days. They\u2019re taking away our right to choose.\u201d\nMaciej Rauhut, a 14-year-old from the small town of Krapkowice who was visited by police officers after sharing a post on Facebook in support of the protests, also spoke of his experiences.\n\nLeader of Poland\u2019s abortion protests charged with \u201cinsulting police\u201d and \u201ccausing epidemic threat\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just told me that I could not turn up at the strike\u2026because they saw me as the organiser of an illegal assembly and would take me to court,\u201d he said, quoted by Polsat.\nLast October\u2019s ruling, which declared terminations in the case of foetal defects \u2013 which make up around 98% of all legal abortions in Poland \u2013 to be unconstitutional, led to the country\u2019s largest demonstrations since the fall of communism.\nA poll last week found that over 80% of women in Poland oppose the new abortion restrictions, with the largest proportion (44%) wanting terminations to be available on demand.\nThe ruling national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party has supported toughening the abortion law, and is widely seen to be behind the ruling. The centrist Civic Platform (PO), the largest opposition party, last week declared support for liberalising access to terminations.\n\nOver 80% of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll\n\nThe young speakers at the convention also discussed the influence of the church, sex education and the situation of LGBT people in Poland.\nThe people wielding power in the country are \u201ca group of old men in cassocks\u2026who try to tell us what a sin is\u201d, said Angelika S\u0142owi\u0144ska. \u201cThey think they know better than us what we should think about our body, sex, pregnancy or abortion. Bishops, I didn\u2019t vote for you.\u201d\nDorota Dominik\u00f3w complained about church influence in education, citing an art competition in her school on the subject of encouraging people to have children and criticising abortion.\n\nPolish primary school pupils to get extra credit for anti-abortion art contest\n\nJakub Pietrzak from Warsaw said the time of \u201cmeek gays\u201d was over and that LGBT people demanded civil unions, full marriage equality, protection from hate speech, and equality in education.\n\u201cThere is no reason for two adults in the 21st century not to be able to say their vows in a civil registry office,\u201d said Robert Biedro\u0144, leader of Spring. Biedro\u0144 himself has expressed hope that he will one day be able to formalise his long-term relationship with Krzysztof \u015amiszek, who also serves as an MP for The Left.\nThe left-wing bloc\u2019s list of proposals also emphasised green issues. Matylda Szpila from Krak\u00f3w spoke of her participation in climate strikes, noting that her city was failing to encourage young people to use public transport by increasing ticket prices for students.\nDespite some advances, Poland has faced criticism for its sluggish progress in environmental issues, and is the only member state not to have signed up to the EU\u2019s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nOnly 9% of young people in Poland view Catholic church positively, finds poll\n\nThe agenda presented at the convention also stressed practical economic problems faced by young people in Poland, such as high rent prices, low pay, and so-called \u201cjunk contracts\u201d, which do not give the same security as full employment contracts.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen an employment contract,\u201d said Henryk W\u00f3jtowicz, another young speaker. \u201cFor my generation it\u2019s some mythical creature \u2013 everyone\u2019s heard of it, but nobody\u2019s seen it.\u201d\nZandberg said that The Left wants to guarantee workers\u2019 rights, including holiday leave, social security and employment stability. Czarzasty added that the alliance would set up a state enterprise to build two million new homes.\n\nPoland records second fastest house price increase in Europe\n\nThe Left faced some criticism for concluding its convention, which had set out a progressive agenda, by having the three male leaders of SLD, Spring and Together taking to the stage.\n\u201cWhere are the women?\u201d asked Katarzyna Lubnauer, the leader of Modern (Nowoczesna), a liberal opposition party.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly and don\u2019t repeat rubbish, Ka\u015bka [the diminutive of Katarzyna],\u201d responded W\u0142odzimierz Czarzasty, the leader of SLD. \u201cWrite something intelligent.\u201d\n\n\nA podobno w Razem zawsze wsp\u00f3\u0142przewodniczenie? Gdzie te kobiety?\n\u2014 Katarzyna Lubnauer (@KLubnauer) February 20, 2021\n\nThe Left obtained 12.5% of the vote at the 2019 parliamentary elections. It currently has 48 seats in the Sejm, Poland\u2019s more powerful lower-house of parliament, making it the second largest opposition bloc behind the PO-led Civic Coalition, which has 132.\nRecent polls have put The Left\u2019s support at almost 10%, making it the fourth most popular grouping behind the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Civic Coalition and a new centrist group, Poland 2050 (Polska 2050).\n\n\nAnd we're there.
