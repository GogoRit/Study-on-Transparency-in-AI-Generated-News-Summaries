Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWorkers have downed tools across Poland as part of a national strike against a top court's near-total ban on abortion. \u00a0People vowed to stay off work on Wednesday following a nationwide call to arms after terminations were outlawed in the country even in cases of congenitally damaged foetuses. \u00a0The Women's Strike, the key organisers of protests over the past week, called the national strike under the slogan: \"We are not going to work\". \u00a0Polish media report that some university classes have been called off, while the mayors of Warsaw and Krakow are also supporting the call for workers to stay off their jobs. \u00a0Tensions have been on a knife-edge in the central European nation of 38 million ever since the Constitutional Tribunal ruling last Thursday sparked daily mass protests. \u00a0People take part in a strike in Warsaw, Poland, against the tightening of abortion laws (Omar Marques/Getty Images)Rage over the ruling, which would deny legal abortions to women even in cases where a child is certain to die upon birth, has been directed at the Roman Catholic Church and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ruling party leader and most powerful politician in the country. \u00a0Women entered churches on Sunday where they disrupted masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings \u2014 while a day later protesters brandished placards which said: \u201cI wish I could abort my government\u201d and \u201cI want choice, not terror\u201d. \u00a0Hillary Margolis, a women's rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent the mass demonstrations continuing despite the risks of the coronavirus pandemic showed how much the ruling \u201cwill impact the lives of everyday women and girls\u201d and that the Polish people \u201cwill not stand for their human rights being violated and their lives and health being put at risk\u201d. \u00a0Yet Poland's deeply conservative government has vowed not to back down. \u00a0RecommendedNational protests against abortion ruling but PM hits outWomen's groups plan more protests over Poland abortion lawHundreds protest in Poland against government crackdown on abortionMr Kaczynski accused protesters of seeking \"to destroy Poland\" late on Tuesday and called on his party's supporters to defend churches \"at any cost\". \u00a0He spoke to a camera backed by Polish flags in an announcement that some critics compared to a notorious announcement of martial law in 1981 by communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski to crack down on anti-regime protests.Some saw his words as an incitement to violence, since the 71-year-old holds the job of deputy prime minister in charge of police and security services.\u00a0On Sunday, members of some far-right groups and football fans surrounded churches to defend them, in some cases provoking skirmishes with protesters and police.\u00a0Szymon Holownia, the founder of a new centrist political movement, claimed Mr Kaczynski, \"in the name of defending the Church, wants to set fire to the country and drown it in blood\". \u00a0RecommendedSharon Osbourne \u2018terrified\u2019 to tell her parents she had abortion at 18Bartosz Weglarczyk, the editor of the news portal Onet, argued that the politician was in effect giving permission to football hooligans and far-right extremists \"to beat people in the streets\". \u00a0Mr Kaczynski, however, insisted it was the protesters who were risking lives by gathering in huge numbers amid a pandemic.\u00a0Interior minister Mariusz Kaminski on Wednesday vowed \"decisive action\" by the police \"in the face of further attempts of similar acts of aggression and desecration announced by the leaders and organisers of the protests\".\u00a0He said 76 people have been detained in connection to protests at churches, and prosecutors are carrying out proceedings in 101 cases. \u00a0People have been taking to the streets in massive numbers even as the coronavirus spreads fast, with a record 18,820 new cases and 236 new deaths over the past day. \u00a0Additional reporting by APMore aboutPolandabortionJaroslaw KaczynskiWomens rightsJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/2Poland abortion ruling prompts nationwide strikePoland abortion ruling prompts nationwide strikePeople take part in a strike in Warsaw, Poland, against the tightening of abortion lawsOmar Marques/Getty ImagesPoland abortion ruling prompts nationwide strikePeople in Warsaw participate in a national strike against tightening of Poland\u2019s abortion lawGetty Images\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
