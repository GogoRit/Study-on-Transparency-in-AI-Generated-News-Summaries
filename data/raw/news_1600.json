(AP) \u2014 Kentucky\u2019s near-total abortion ban would be relaxed to allow exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest under a bill introduced Wednesday by a prominent lawmaker, who stopped short of predicting how his Republican colleagues will react to his proposal.Republican state Rep. Jason Nemes offered the measure on the final day for bills to be filed in the House for this year\u2019s 30-day legislative session, which reaches the midway point Thursday.Nemes, a member of House GOP leadership as majority whip, said he has discussed the bill with colleagues but wouldn\u2019t predict how it will fare with the chamber\u2019s Republican supermajority. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s something I believe in,\u201d Nemes told reporters. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think it\u2019s what our citizens want us to do.\u201dThe new bill surfaced nearly a week after Kentucky\u2019s Supreme Court refused to halt the near-total statewide abortion ban that has largely been in place since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nThe justices, however, ruled on narrow legal issues, leaving unanswered the larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the Bluegrass State. They sent the case back to a lower court for further consideration of constitutional issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky House backs giving lawmakers authority over statues in Capitol Rotunda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA booming bourbon industry has Kentucky leaders toasting record growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky juvenile facilities have issues with force, staffing, report says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law bans abortions except when they are carried out to save the life of the mother or to prevent disabling injury. It doesn\u2019t include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The law was passed in 2019 and took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNemes\u2019 bill would allow abortions for up to 15 weeks of pregnancy in cases of rape or incest. The procedure could be done when a physician \u201creasonably believes\u201d the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest, and the doctor certifies so in writing.The measure includes another exemption to allow abortions when two doctors determine that a fetus has an \u201cabnormality that is incompatible with life outside the womb.\u201d\n\nThe bill would maintain the existing exception to protect the mother\u2019s life.The additional exceptions in the measure also would be added to a separate Kentucky law prohibiting abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy.The new proposal is likely to reignite heated debates over abortion policy in Kentucky.Republican state Rep. Emily Callaway recently introduced a bill aimed at allowing illegal abortions to be prosecuted as homicides. Kentucky Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron said the bill would wrongly subject Kentucky women to charges for terminating pregnancies and urged the GOP-led legislature to reject it. The anti-abortion attorney general is running for governor this year.Meanwhile, Democratic state Rep. Lindsey Burke on Wednesday said she will push for legislation to restore abortion access in Kentucky.\u201cPregnant people in Kentucky should have a right to determine for themselves, with advice from their doctor and their trusted loved ones, how they wish to manage their health care decisions and needs,\u201d Burke said at a news conference.The debate comes after Kentucky voters last year rejected a measure on the midterm election ballot that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
