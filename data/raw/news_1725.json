(States Newsroom and Idaho Capital Sun)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. House on Wednesday approved its first abortion-related measures under a new Republican majority, eliciting strong support from GOP members and opposition from Democrats, who rejected the legislation as misleading and incomplete.\u00a0\nRepublicans, who secured a four-seat majority during the November midterm elections, said the bill setting medical standards on a national level for a baby born after an attempted abortion and a resolution condemning violence against anti-abortion organizations are central to the party\u2019s ideals.\u00a0\nDemocrats contended the medical standards bill from GOP Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri would circumvent health care providers\u2019 medical judgment.\u00a0\n\u201cDespite what its supporters would have us believe, this legislation would do nothing to enhance protections or the quality of health care if an infant is born after an attempted abortion,\u201d New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler said during floor debate.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat it would do, however, is directly interfere with a doctor\u2019s medical judgment and dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances, which could in fact put infants\u2019 lives at greater risk,\u201d Nadler added.\u00a0\nWagner urged support for her bill, saying lawmakers were \u201cconsidering the protection of infants that have been delivered alive after an attempted abortion.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s it \u2014 plain and simple.\u201d Wagner said.\u00a0\nRep. Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, said that \u201cfederal law currently recognizes these babies as persons, but fails to outline any requirements of care after the infant is born alive.\u201d\nPennsylvania Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean urged the House to reject the bill, saying Republicans were either unaware infanticide was an already existing crime or engaged in \u201canother extreme political stunt.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cPoliticians have no business making unsound medical decisions. We are legislators, not doctors,\u201d Dean said. \u201cAnd in the unfortunate case when a child is born with fatal disabilities, this legislation will deny parents a say in how their child spends the final minutes, hours or days of his or her life \u2014 whether hooked up to a medical device or in the arms of his parents.\u201d\u00a0\nHouse lawmakers, who are in their first week of work after Republicans elected a speaker early Saturday on a 15th ballot, ultimately voted 220-210 to approve Wagner\u2019s legislation. It would reinforce the core elements of a 2002 law that passed the U.S. House on a voice vote and the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent.\u00a0\nTexas Democrat Henry Cuellar voted for the bill while Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez, also a Texas Democrat, voted present.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n Idaho House bill would penalize abortion \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019\n\nThe House State Affairs Committee of the Idaho Legislature voted to introduce a bill Wednesday morning that adds penalties to state abortion law by withholding sales and use tax revenue distributions from cities and other public officials who refuse to enforce Idaho\u2019s abortion laws.\nThe Idaho Legislature passed the No Public Funds for Abortion Act in 2021. It prohibits public funds from being used to \u201cprocure, counsel in favor, refer to or perform an abortion.\u201d In 2022, following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Idaho\u2019s trigger law banning nearly all abortions went into effect and the Idaho Supreme Court ruled the ban could stand earlier this month.\nHouse Bill 2, sponsored by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, would rename the law to the No Funds for Abortion Act and tie other violations of the act to a section of Idaho Code about misuse of public dollars.\nThe penalties associated with that section of code range from a misdemeanor to a felony.\n  Rep. Bruce D. Skaug (R, Nampa) speaks to the House State Affairs committee at the Idaho State Capitol building on January 11, 2023, to introduce an abortion-related bill. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)\nThe bill comes after the Boise City Council narrowly passed a resolution in July 2022 limiting city resources from being used to take legal action against someone for seeking or performing an abortion.\nThe resolution prohibits law enforcement and others from prioritizing investigations for the purpose of prosecuting abortion providers. So far, Boise is the only city that has taken such action in Idaho.\nUnder the proposed law, Boise\u2019s allotment of sales tax \u2014 which was $6.7 million in 2022, according to a city budget report \u2014 would be held back by the Idaho State Tax Commission unless the resolution is repealed or rescinded.\nChanges to the law also include a statement clarifying that the law should not be interpreted to mean classroom discussion on the subject of abortion at a school, college or university qualifies as \u201cpromoting\u201d abortion. The University of Idaho\u2019s legal counsel issued a memo in September stating university employees should remain neutral when discussing abortion as a policy issue in classrooms or risk violating the law.\n\u201cWe had some people from one of our universities think that the bill from two years ago was limiting their ability to discuss abortion, and that\u2019s not at all the intent,\u201d Skaug said. \u201cIt never was.\u201d\nThe bill should receive a hearing in the House State Affairs Committee in the coming weeks.\n\u2014 Kelcie Moseley-Morris\n\n\n\n\n Little future in Senate\n\nThe bill passed Wednesday, which is unlikely to make it through the Democratic Senate or be signed into law by President Joe Biden, says that if \u201can abortion results in the live birth of an infant, the infant is a legal person for all purposes under the laws of the United States.\u201d\nThe Wagner bill calls on health care providers to render the same level of care \u201cto preserve the life and health of the child\u201d as they would for \u201cany other child born alive at the same gestational age.\u201d\nAnyone found guilty of violating the standard could receive up to five years in prison. The bill provides a carve-out that would prevent prosecution of the person receiving the abortion as well as parameters for the individual to file a lawsuit.\u00a0\nDr. Jennifer Villavicencio, lead for equity transformation at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a written statement that it\u2019s a myth that fetuses or newborns \u201care accidentally born alive during the course of an abortion procedure.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\n\u201cIt does not happen because the methods of abortion utilized and the expertise of the physician ensures that this does not occur,\u201d Villavicencio said.\u00a0\n\u201cThere may be situations in which a devastating and often life threatening pregnancy condition results in a neonate being born with signs of life and no chance of survival,\u201d Villavicencio added. \u201cThese cases almost always involve highly desired pregnancies and are tragic and heart wrenching.\u201d\nIn those circumstances, Villavicencio said, patients work with health care providers and sometimes spiritual advisers to make a decision about care.\u00a0\n\u201cForcing clinicians to instead perform futile and invasive interventions for a neonate with no chance of survival is cruel,\u201d Villavicencio said.\u00a0\n Anti-abortion centers\n\nSeparately, the House voted 222-209 to approve a seven-page resolution from Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson that\u2019s designed to draw attention to incidents of vandalism and arson at anti-abortion pregnancy centers and other anti-abortion organizations.\u00a0\nPennsylvania\u2019s Chrissy Houlahan, Gonz\u00e1lez and Washington\u2019s Marie Gluesenkamp Perez were the three Democrats to vote for the measure.\nThe measure highlights 35 incidents that have taken place since Politico broke the story in May 2022 that a draft opinion showed conservative justices were slated to overturn Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court case that kept abortion legal throughout the nation for nearly 50 years. The court later ended the constitutional right to an abortion, sending the issue back to state lawmakers.\u00a0\nThe Johnson resolution condemned the incidents of \u201cvandalism, violence, and destruction against pro-life facilities, groups, and churches\u201d and said the U.S. House of Representatives \u201crecognizes the sanctity of life and the important role pro-life facilities, groups, and churches play in supporting pregnant women, infants, and families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\nIt called on the Biden administration to use \u201call appropriate law enforcement authorities to uphold public safety and to protect the rights of pro-life facilities, groups, and churches.\u201d\nJohnson argued during floor debate that lawmakers should support the more than 2,700 anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers throughout the country.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have to stand against violence and vandalism and personal threats and intimidation,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey do not deserve the treatment they\u2019ve endured, and they certainly deserve that this Congress condemns the violence committed against them.\u201d\nDemocrats countered that the resolution was incomplete since it didn\u2019t condemn threats, violence, bombings and murders of health care workers at facilities that perform abortions.\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat, said she was appalled Republicans brought a resolution to the floor that \u201csays nothing about the violence against abortion providers that has gone largely unaddressed for nearly 50 years.\u201d\u00a0\nThe National Abortion Federation\u2019s 2021 report on violence and disruption showed an \u201cincrease in intimidation tactics, vandalism, and other activities aimed at disrupting services, harassing providers, and blocking patients\u2019 access to abortion care.\u201d\nStalking rose by 600%, blockades jumped by 450%, hoax devices/suspicious packages increased by 163%, invasions surged by 129% and assault and battery by 128% compared to 2020, according to the NAF report.\u00a0\nOregon Democrat Suzanne Bonamici said during floor debate the Johnson resolution was \u201ca distraction from the real issue regarding crisis pregnancy centers, which is that they regularly provide inaccurate, incomplete and injurious information to people who are seeking guidance and fact-based health care.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCrisis pregnancy centers often engage in deceptive advertising to get people in the door, and then they mislead them about the services they provide,\u201d Bonamici said.\u00a0\u00a0\n Contrast to last year\n\nThe two measures the U.S. House voted on Wednesday were a stark contrast to the legislation Democrats brought to the U.S. House floor last summer after the high court ruling.\nThe Democratic legislation, which passed on mostly party-line votes, would have ensured people the right to travel out of state to access abortion amid discussion in some Republican-controlled state legislatures about trying to make such movements illegal.\nA separate Democratic bill would have legalized abortion nationwide and prevented lawmakers from instituting restrictions before viability, which is typically around 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\u00a0\nLawmakers would have been barred from restricting abortion after viability when \u201cin the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient\u2019s life or health.\u201d\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Wednesday that the two measures the U.S. House approved would not get past the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate.\n\u201cThese bills are doomed in the Senate,\u201d Schumer wrote on Twitter. \u201cAmerican women deserve to have their right to healthcare protected, not undermined.\u201d\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRepublican lawmakers in Idaho and D.C. advance anti-abortion bills\nby Jennifer Shutt, Idaho Capital Sun January 12, 2023\nRepublican lawmakers in Idaho and D.C. advance anti-abortion bills\nby Jennifer Shutt, Idaho Capital Sun January 12, 2023\n \nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. House on Wednesday approved its first abortion-related measures under a new Republican majority, eliciting strong support from GOP members and opposition from Democrats, who rejected the legislation as misleading and incomplete.\u00a0\nRepublicans, who secured a four-seat majority during the November midterm elections, said the bill setting medical standards on a national level for a baby born after an attempted abortion and a resolution condemning violence against anti-abortion organizations are central to the party\u2019s ideals.\u00a0\nDemocrats contended the medical standards bill from GOP Rep.
