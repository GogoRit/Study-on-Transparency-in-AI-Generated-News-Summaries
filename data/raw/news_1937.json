Ashley Hudson, D-Little Rock, presents HB1670 to members of the House Judiciary committee on Thursday, March 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn effort to allow children and victims of incest to obtain an abortion has failed in the Arkansas Legislature.Members of the House Judiciary committee on Thursday rejected House Bill 1670, sponsored by Rep. Ashley Hudson, D-Little Rock.Speaking before the vote, Hudson challenged Republicans to support the bill on the grounds it would protect children.\u201cWe\u2019ve also spent an awful lot of time this session talking about things that kids aren\u2019t ready to do. We\u2019ve talked about materials they\u2019re not ready to read, we\u2019ve talked about materials they\u2019re not ready to see, we\u2019ve talked about activities they\u2019re not ready to perform, and yet we talk about making them parents,\u201d Hudson said.The bill would have expanded the exceptions to Arkansas\u2019 abortion ban to include cases of incest and children under 16, which is the age of consent in the state. Hudson said children who get pregnant are more likely to suffer potentially life-threatening complications, though that likely would not be enough to qualify for Arkansas\u2019 current exception to its abortion ban.\u201cWhen we are talking about a situation in which a 10-year-old child is being forced to carry a pregnancy to term that may kill her, that may result in a dead baby or that may result in permanent, lifetime physical disabilities, then we need to take a really serious look at what we\u2019re doing and why we want the public policy of this state to sentence children to these types of issues,\u201d Hudson said.Hudson noted Arkansas has the fourth-highest maternal mortality rate in the U.S., as well as the highest rate of children under 15 years of age who get pregnant. Arkansas law currently allow abortion only to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency.Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, said she hadn\u2019t personally seen any evidence that children who get pregnant suffer negative health outcomes.\u201cWould you not agree that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d Crawford said, \u201cthat her mental health would be worse after she experienced an abortion than it would to be able to, with help, with support, give birth to the child and place the baby for adoption?\u201dThe bill failed on a voice vote. Another bill which would have allowed abortion in the case of deadly fetal abnormalities also failed in committee earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nLocal & Regional News\n2023 Arkansas Legislative SessionArkansas AbortionArkansas Healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Breen\n\n\n                \n                    Daniel Breen is News Director of Little Rock Public Radio.\n                \n            \n\n\n                        See stories by Daniel Breen\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom NPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreats, debt and Trump's advances: 'Stormy' doc examines the life of Stormy Daniels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo long, Stumpy.
