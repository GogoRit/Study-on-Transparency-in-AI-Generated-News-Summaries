Charlie Crist, D-Fla., is running for governor of Florida. [\u00a0REBECCA BLACKWELL  |  AP\u00a0]By Yacob ReyesPolitiFactPublished April 27, 2022The political career of U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, a Democratic candidate for Florida governor, spans three decades, three party affiliations and multiple positions on sensitive issues.On April 12, Shannon Cake of WPTV in West Palm Beach quizzed Crist on his political evolution, specifically where he currently stood on LGBTQ rights and abortion.While Crist readily admitted that he had changed his position on gay marriage, he said his stance on whether women should have the right to obtain an abortion hadn\u2019t changed.Related: Now a Democrat, Charlie Crist regrets signing anti-gay marriage petition\u201cI believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose. I always have,\u201d Crist said. \u201cI am still pro-life \u2014 meaning I am for life. I hope most people are, and I think it\u2019s important to understand the distinction.\u201dCake pushed back at his use of \u201cpro-life,\u201d because it doesn\u2019t precisely describe the political discourse surrounding abortion. Crist maintained that he was \u201cfor life\u201d and also supported women\u2019s right to choose.PolitiFact has fact-checked claims related to Crist\u2019s view on abortion more than five times. It\u2019s difficult to condense to a sound bite.Crist\u2019s stance has been consistently inconsistent. He\u2019s called himself both \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-choice\u201d throughout his career, defining them on his own terms.As a raft of new abortion laws take hold in Republican-led states across the U.S. \u2014 including Florida \u2014 we wanted to take a fresh look at Crist\u2019s record.Let\u2019s examine the evidence.Crist was \u2018pro-choice\u2019 at the start of his careerWhen Crist arrived on Florida\u2019s political scene in 1992 \u2014 then a Republican from St. Petersburg, running for the state Legislature \u2014 his stance on abortion was less murky: the decision should rest with women, not the government.Crist told the Miami Herald that he did not support state-funded abortion.Such rhetoric reappeared throughout much of his early career in the Florida Senate. In 1995, Crist broke from party lines to vote down a measure that would have imposed a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion.At the time, Crist argued that his position fell in line with Republican tendencies to favor small government involvement. As he began to eye a national office, his support for abortion rights grew more conditional.In March 1998, Crist expressed opposition to late-term abortion and voted with the Senate to override former Gov. Lawton Chiles\u2019 veto of a bill aimed at prohibiting the procedure.Later, in a bid for a U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist wrote in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times that he was \u201cpro-choice, but not pro-abortion.\u201d Thus began the argument that though he didn\u2019t personally favor the procedure, he didn\u2019t aim to strike it down.This position was further cemented when Crist said he wouldn\u2019t back a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion. He lost that race.Charlie Crist declares another run for Florida governor during a rally in St. Petersburg on May 4, 2021. This will be Crist\u2019s second attempt at winning back the job he held from 2007 to 2011, when he was a Republican. [\u00a0DIRK SHADD  |  Times\u00a0]Crist re-cast himself as \u2018pro-life\u2019 in the 2006 gubernatorial raceAs he geared up to run for Florida governor in 2006, Crist re-cast himself more simply as \u201cpro-life.\u201dDuring the Republican primary, one of Crist\u2019s opponents cast doubt on his position on abortion, releasing a campaign ad that labeled him \u201cpro-choice.\u201d Crist\u2019s campaign called it false and fired back with an ad that claimed Crist was \u201cpro-life.\u201dStill, Crist\u2019s remarks on abortion continued to puzzle \u201cactivists on both sides of the abortion debate,\u201d according to the Miami Herald.On the one hand, he publicly expressed opposition to the procedure. On the other, he said he wouldn\u2019t support repealing the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that made it legal.In 2006, Crist routinely said politicians shouldn\u2019t put \u201cthemselves in the place of physicians.\u201d However, during that campaign, Crist also told a priest he would sign a bill prohibiting abortions except when the mother\u2019s life was at stake.Crist won the Republican nomination and became governor of Florida for four years. His bid for the U.S. Senate introduced more flexibility on abortion.In the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist\u2019s campaign released a statement that he would \u201cfight for pro-life legislative efforts.\u201d When his primary chances soured, Crist left the Republican Party and continued an unsuccessful run for the Senate seat with no party affiliation.Before he left the governor\u2019s office, Crist vetoed legislation that would have required women to get an ultrasound before opting to have an abortion, saying he found it \u201cpunitive.\u201dCrist\u2019s position on abortion becomes more clear after 2012Out of office in 2012, Crist endorsed former President Barack Obama for reelection in an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times and complained about the Republican Party pitching \u201cso far to the extreme right on issues important to women.\u201dA few months later, Crist officially signed papers to become a Democrat for an unsuccessful bid for governor against Republican Rick Scott.On the now-defunct website for his 2014 campaign, Crist stated: \u201cCharlie supports a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions \u2014 as governor, he vetoed a measure that required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound, a law that Rick Scott signed. Charlie believes that government should stay out of personal health decisions between a woman and her doctor.\u201dRecently, when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, Crist denounced the move, using a similar rationale.DeSantis has signed into law an unconstitutional attack on women that strips away their reproductive freedom.Women should make decisions about their own bodies, not governors. I'd veto this bill and any attempt to restrict the right to choose. Full stop.\u2014 Charlie Crist (@CharlieCrist) April 14, 2022\n\nRelated: DeSantis just signed a 15-week abortion ban. Here are 3 things that come next.Crist\u2019s campaign also pointed to his congressional record. In 2017, Crist voted against legislation that aimed to prohibit abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.He also voted against efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides health care services, including abortion.Crist is one of multiple Democrats running in the Aug. 23 primary for governor. The winner will face DeSantis in November.Our rulingCrist said in a TV interview that he has \u201calways\u201d believed \u201cin a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201dThat\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s difficult to summarize Crist\u2019s views on abortion over three decades in a nutshell, because he has expressed conflicting statements. But he has made some statements that went against the choice to have an abortion, including in 2006 when Crist told a priest that he would sign a bill prohibiting abortion except when the mother\u2019s life was at stake. In 2010 his campaign said in a statement that Crist would \u201cfight for pro-life legislative efforts.\u201dThere are other times when Crist made statements in favor of abortion access, such as when he said he would not be in favor of repealing Roe v. Wade. But on the whole, he takes it too far when he says he \u201calways\u201d supported a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion.We rate this statement False.PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.Up next:Disney\u2019s special district suggests Florida can\u2019t dissolve it without paying debtMORE FOR YOUThe latest on Florida State, ACC dueling lawsuits 1 hour ago\u2022 SportsScenes from the Florida presidential preference primary4 hours ago\u2022 FloridaAdvertisementNotario fraud leaves immigrants vulnerable to deportationEarlier today\u2022 NewsIs Tampa\u2019s Tim Burke still a journalist?Earlier today\u2022 The Buzz on Florida PoliticsHow much will Trump win by? 4 things Florida\u2019s primary can tell usEarlier today\u2022 ElectionsUSF students begin hunger strike, confront trustees over Israel-Hamas warYesterday\u2022 NewsClearwater\u2019s election is here.
