They said that\u00a0its primary\u00a0legislative aim was to repeal Article 241 of the Criminal Code and any other such legislation that may be related to the criminal sanctioning of abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe group acknowledged that there are some women who would wish to continue with their pregnancy even in cases of unfavourable situations, and these should be well supported by social services. However, at the same time, it acknowledged that this is not everyone\u2019s choice, and those who need access to abortion should be helped and supported.\n\u201cAbortion should be regulated under healthcare policy and not under criminal law. The lack of a clear legal framework and policy guidelines for when a woman\u2019s life is at risk is particularly worrying and should be changed to clearly reflect the absolute protection of women in Malta,\u201d the paper read.\nDoctor\u2019s for Choice said that due to the lack of abortion services, Malta\u2019s medical authorities are falling short of best-practices and highest standards recommended by international guidelines which are based on evidence-based medicine.\n\u201cWe have provided evidence that despite abortion being illegal, people in Malta still seek and obtain abortions both locally and abroad. Therefore, doctors inevitably deal with issues related to abortion and it is undesirable for them not to be well-informed and well-trained on these matters.\u201d\nThe group highlighted that a recent study conducted in Malta\u00a0found that out of 454 doctors the majority do not agree with a total ban on abortion and support its legalisation in limited circumstances.\n\u201cThere were clear majorities favouring legalisation when a woman\u2019s life is in danger and in cases of non-viable fetal anomalies. There was also support, albeit to a lesser extent, in other circumstances such as rape (or incest), to preserve physical and mental health.\u201d\nDoctors for Choice also detailed the limitations doctors are met with when it came to advising pregnant women on abortion as well as providing post-abortion care.\n\u201cWomen in Malta do procure abortion either by travelling abroad, purchasing medical abortion pills online, or attempting unsafe non-recommended methods\u2026 these women are reluctant to seek medical help if they experience difficulties or complications (out of fear of being criminalised). If they do eventually seek help, they do so at a later than ideal stage, and even then, they are reluctant to disclose all the information which would normally help doctors manage the patient safely.\u201d\nThe group also said it effected the relationship doctors were able to have with their patients. They argued that women\u2019s reluctance to speak about having an abortion with their GP meant that more often than not they are left to take care of themselves. \u201cThe lack of accessibility to professionals who are willing to help them make their own informed decisions may lead to options of sub-standard or unsafe procedures.\u201d\nAbortion ban: a risk to women\u2019s lives \nThe group said that the criminal code currently has no provision for abortion under any circumstances, not even when a woman\u2019s life is imminently at risk of death as a result of pregnancy. This, Doctors for Choice said, puts women\u2019s lives inherently at risk.\nThey criticised the current local medical practice that is generally applied, the ethical principle of double-effect \u2013 this principle originated in Catholic philosophy, it says that it is permissible to do something morally good that has a morally bad side-effect.\n\u201cAlthough it may be considered a guiding ethical principle, this does not provide clear grounds on how to act in certain sensitive situations. For example, it may result in treatment being delayed (as precious time can be wasted waiting for the condition of the woman and/or fetus to improve or deteriorate), thereby possibly endangering a woman\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe paper was prepared and written by Dr Christopher Barbara, Dr Gilbert Gravino, Dr Jamie Grech, Dr Natalie Psaila, Dr Elena Saliba and Prof. Isabel Stabile. \nDownloadable Files\n\n\nposition_paper_on_abortion.pdf \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Calleja is features editor at MaltaToday \n\n More from Laura Calleja\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise \nContact \nDigital Edition\nSMS Alerts\n\n\nTerms and Conditions \nPrivacy Policy \nCookie Policy \nArchives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaToday is an independent media house based in Malta.
