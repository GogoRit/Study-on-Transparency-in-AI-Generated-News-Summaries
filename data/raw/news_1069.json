REUTERS/Toya Sarno JordanWhat\u2019s the context?The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade will have repercussions from Africa to Latin America, say women's health advocates\n\nRoe v. Wade will echo around world, say experts\n\n\nAnti-abortion campaigns energized by ruling\n\n\nLandmark decision likely to drive fundraising boost\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision to revoke a woman's right to abortion could threaten efforts to liberalize laws in other countries and fuel calls to roll back progressive legislation, reproductive rights experts say.\nThey warned that the court's bombshell ruling on June 24 would embolden anti-abortion groups and lawmakers in Africa, Latin America and beyond.\nIt could also hurt funding for sexual and reproductive health services in developing nations, rights experts said.Go DeeperWhy are U.S. abortion rights battles focusing on pills?Go DeeperU.S. Supreme Court ruling: demand for abortion pills set to soarGo DeeperRoe v Wade: Which US states are banning abortion?\"When America sneezes, the world catches cold,\" said former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, chairwoman of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health\u00a0(PMNCH), which is backed by the World Health Organization.\nThe Supreme Court's reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide is expected to effectively\u00a0end access to terminations\u00a0in about half of U.S. states.\nHere are some ways it could also impact other countries:\nIncrease funding to anti-abortion groups\nThe U.S. ruling will give anti-abortion groups worldwide \"a massive confidence boost\" and be used to leverage funding, said Sarah Shaw, head of advocacy at\u00a0MSI Reproductive Choices, which provides sexual and reproductive healthcare in 37 countries.\nShaw said many anti-abortion groups operating in Africa were supported and partially funded by U.S.-based organizations and private U.S. donors.\nPaula Avila-Guillen, executive director of the\u00a0Women's Equality Center, which supports reproductive rights organizations in Latin America, said the ruling had already emboldened anti-abortion groups.\n\"This is worrying because they will try to attack some of the victories we have achieved,\" she said.\nColombia, Argentina and Mexico have recently lifted abortion bans in what has been called the \"Green Wave\" movement.\nReproductive rights experts said U.S. and European anti-abortion groups were setting up \"crisis pregnancy centers\" in Latin America and Africa. These centers often suggest that they perform abortions, but in reality try to stop women having them.\nPowerful anti-abortion groups include U.S.-based\u00a0Heartbeat International, which supports crisis pregnancy centers in the United States and abroad;\u00a0CitizenGO, founded in Spain but funded partly through U.S. donations; and\u00a040 Days for Life, which started in Texas and operates in more than 60 countries.\u00a0\nShaw said a quarter of MSI programs - including those in Malawi, Mexico and Uganda - reported that opposition to abortion was being driven from outside the country.\nSome MSI programs have also seen a rise in \"mystery shoppers\" - activists posing as clients who try to trick staff into offering abortion services in places where it is restricted.\nEven in countries where abortion is legal, the ruling is likely to fuel harassment of abortion providers and women seeking terminations, she said.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThreaten efforts to reform laws\nThe U.S. ruling could energize opponents of abortion in other countries, stymieing efforts to ease bans and even leading to the unpicking of new laws.\nAvila-Guillen said Mexico, which decriminalized abortion last year, was a particular concern due to its proximity to the United States and because some of its 32 states had not yet amended their penal codes.\nShe also warned that extreme right-wing political groups had redoubled their efforts to stop the spread of the \"Green Wave\" reaching countries like Dominican Republic, Honduras, and El Salvador which retain draconian bans.\nEvangelical churches, which have seen rapid growth in Latin America and wield increasing political clout, were also pushing for total bans on abortion, she said.\nBrazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who rose to power with strong support from evangelicals, took to Twitter last week to condemn a decision to let an 11-year-old rape victim have an abortion.\nIn Argentina, the U.S. ruling was welcomed by libertarian lawmaker Javier Milei, who is likely to run against the country's pro-abortion president, Alberto Fernandez, in next year's election.\nEvelyne Opondo, senior regional director for Africa at the\u00a0Center for Reproductive Rights\u00a0(CRR), urged extra vigilance against moves to erode reproductive health rights in countries that have made recent progress.\nShe said it was crucial to strengthen training with the police and hospital staff to ensure they were not influenced by anti-abortion rhetoric, understood the law, and did not harass\u00a0 abortion providers.\nAfrican countries that have recently eased abortion restrictions include Kenya and Benin.\nIn Malawi, PMNCH said the U.S. repeal could stall efforts to pass legislation to allow abortion when a woman's health was at risk \"and women will continue to die as a result\".\nThe ruling could also hurt efforts to expand access in Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Senegal, MSI said.\nA 2015 bill to legalize abortion in Sierra Leone has yet to be signed into law amid pressure from religious groups.\nLawmakers in Liberia are debating a similar bill.\u00a0\u00a0\nDecrease funding for sexual and reproductive health\nMSI's Shaw said countries that receive large amounts of U.S. aid money may deprioritize maternal health care in general for fear of jeopardizing their funding by being seen as pro-choice.\n\"The ruling will have a chilling effect. We expect to see increased lobbying against passing policies supportive of sexual and reproductive health and rights,\" Shaw added.\n\"It's going to really deter governments from talking about these issues, prioritizing these issues and investing funding from other sources.\"\nU.S. overseas funding for sexual and reproductive health cannot be used for abortion services under what is known as the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act.\nPro-choice groups fear the Supreme Court ruling will also\u00a0hurt efforts\u00a0to repeal the amendment.\nDestabilize a global shift towards abortion access\nMSI's Shaw described the U.S. ruling as a \"massive curve ball\" at a time when the overall global trend was towards increasing access to abortion.\nAround 60 countries have expanded rights in the last 30 years. Only a handful have moved in the opposite direction including Poland, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\"We cannot lose sight of the progress that is happening all around us,\" said Opondo.\nIn Latin America, all eyes are now on Chile, which holds a public referendum in September on a new constitution that enshrines a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy.\nIn Europe, France's Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne has also backed a parliamentary bill to add abortion rights to the country's constitution.\n(Additional reporting by Nita Bhalla; Editing by Sonia Elks.)Context is powered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation Newsroom.Our Standards: Thomson Reuters Trust PrinciplesPart of:Abortion restrictions around the worldIn the past year, from the United States to Poland, obstacles have been placed on abortion access as conservative lawmakers tighten restrictions on terminations - what is the state of abortion rights around the world?Updated: March 17, 2023TagsGender equityEconomic inclusionMORE ON Money, Power & PeopleMoney, Power & PeopleIndians risk illegal 'donkey' migration to chase American DreamMoney, Power & PeopleFlown back and forgotten: Filipino migrants face tough homecomingMoney, Power & PeopleDespite war, Indians rush to fill Israel's construction jobs gapMORE ON Inclusive EconomiesOpinionSocioeconomic InclusionHaiti's gang violence disproportionately hurts women and girlsSocioeconomic InclusionSerbian LGBTQ+ couples hope Greek marriage law kick-starts changeSocioeconomic InclusionNigeria clips nurses' wings to prevent brain drainFeatured Podcast6 EPISODESJust TransitionPodcastJust TransitionThe human stories behind the shift to a green economyPodcastGo DeeperSocioeconomic InclusionWhy are U.S. abortion rights battles focusing on pills?Money, Power & PeopleU.S. Supreme Court ruling: demand for abortion pills set to soarMoney, Power & PeopleRoe v Wade: Which US states are banning abortion?Socioeconomic InclusionWhy are U.S. abortion rights battles focusing on pills?Money, Power & PeopleU.S. Supreme Court ruling: demand for abortion pills set to soarMoney, Power & PeopleRoe v Wade: Which US states are banning abortion?Related5:22Money, Power & PeopleThe high price of America's anti-abortion laws11:09Money, Power & PeopleAntiwork & The Great Resignation: Why workers are quitting their jobsLong ReadMoney, Power & PeopleOn perilous Dari\u00e9n Gap trek, migrants risk all for American dream5:22Money, Power & PeopleThe high price of America's anti-abortion laws11:09Money, Power & PeopleAntiwork & The Great Resignation: Why workers are quitting their jobsLong ReadMoney, Power & PeopleOn perilous Dari\u00e9n Gap trek, migrants risk all for American dreamGet \u2018Policy, honestly\u2019 to learn how big decisions impact ordinary people.Email address:SubscribeBy providing your email, you agree to our Privacy Policy.MORE ON Money, Power & PeopleMoney, Power & PeopleIndians risk illegal 'donkey' migration to chase American DreamMoney, Power & PeopleFlown back and forgotten: Filipino migrants face tough homecomingMoney, Power & PeopleDespite war, Indians rush to fill Israel's construction jobs gapMORE ON Inclusive EconomiesOpinionSocioeconomic InclusionHaiti's gang violence disproportionately hurts women and girlsSocioeconomic InclusionSerbian LGBTQ+ couples hope Greek marriage law kick-starts changeSocioeconomic InclusionNigeria clips nurses' wings to prevent brain drainLatest on ContextDigital RightsPakistan's WhatsApp death sentence case spotlights blasphemy lawClimate RisksReading the ruins of Amazon fires, scientists see crisis aheadOpinionClimate RisksTime to fix broken food systems - Sierra Leone presidentJust TransitionHow can fashion's net-zero future be paid for fairly?Most Read1Americans move to climate-risky areas as real estate booms2Soaring abuse in UK care jobs shatters migrants' dreams3Palestinian tech firms adapt to survive as war hits business4Time to fix broken food systems - Sierra Leone president5US cities map investors snapping up affordable homes6How can fashion's net-zero future be paid for fairly?Most Read1Americans move to climate-risky areas as real estate booms2Soaring abuse in UK care jobs shatters migrants' dreams3Palestinian tech firms adapt to survive as war hits business4Time to fix broken food systems - Sierra Leone president5US cities map investors snapping up affordable homesContext is a media platform created by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
