Tony Evers said he will support.It\u2019s a reintroduction of a bill proposed last session, shortly after Roe vs. Wade was overturned, bringing a pre-Civil War abortion ban in Wisconsin into effect.The proposed bill would repeal that ban. Democratic lawmakers said it would return the right to abortion access in the state.\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill \u201cwill restore access to safe, legal abortion in Wisconsin to what it was on June 23, 2022,\u201d the day before the fall of Roe, Evers said at a press conference announcing the legislation on Tuesday morning.A lawsuit challenging the existing ban is pending in the courts and is likely to go in front of the state Supreme Court. In two weeks, an election will determine the ideological balance of the court that will hear that lawsuit.Rep. Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, who co-authored the bill, said the bill seeks to establish abortion access without court input.\u201cWe can\u2019t just sit and wait for the courts to act,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need clarity now.\u201dLawmakers on Tuesday said that the abortion ban is bad for women\u2019s health, and discourages people from living in Wisconsin.\u201cPatients have been forced to leave the state. Even those patients facing serious health complications have had to travel out of state to receive the medical care that they need,\u201d said Subeck.Dr. Kathy King, an OB-GYN and medical director of Planned Parenthood Wisconsin, joined lawmakers in supporting the restoration of abortion rights.\u201cI know \u2014 as do my medical colleagues \u2014 that pregnancy can be many things,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that pregnancy can be joyous and amazing culminating in the birth of a beautiful healthy baby. I know the pregnancy can be devastating when complications occur.\u201dKing argued that abortion bans like Wisconsin\u2019s lead to later-stage abortions after medical complications worsen \u2014 \u201cThe very thing some abortion bans claim to be trying to prevent,\u201d she said.A majority of Wisconsinites, both Democrats and Republicans, support allowing abortion in at least some instances. A September 2022 Marquette University Law Poll found more than 80 percent of Wisconsinites believe abortion should be legal in the case of rape or incest.Wisconsin\u2019s ban offers no such exceptions.\u201cIt\u2019s growing increasingly tiring for people in this building to accept the premise that restoring Roe and access to safe, legal abortion are radical ideas that only Democrats support,\u201d Evers said. \u201cThey\u2019re not. Republicans, Independents, Democrats \u2014 Wisconsinites overwhelmingly support Roe and safe, legal access to abortion.\u201dThe announcement comes after legislative Republicans introduced a bill to add some exceptions to the ban. That bill is all but certainly dead in the Senate, and Evers has repeatedly said he will not support legislation that falls short of restoring full abortion access.On Tuesday, Evers called on Republicans to engage with Democrats on the issue.\u201cWe have a bill. Let\u2019s have a debate,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans have their bill; the Democrats have their bill. People of Wisconsin should be able to hear a debate about this issue. Not silence. We need a debate.\u201dIn response, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos issued a statement decrying Evers\u2019 \u201chypocrisy.\u201d\u201cLast week, Legislative Republicans introduced a bill that\u2019s a reasonable middle ground to the divisive and opposing viewpoints on abortion. Governor Evers immediately said he would veto it,\u201d Vos said. \u201cLegislative Republicans have continued to say we\u2019re willing to discuss and find consensus. Instead, Governor Evers issues an ultimatum of no negotiating.\u201d\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nAlluding to Trump, Biden calls out Republicans \u2018bragging\u2019 about abortion bans \n\n \n\n\n\nAs 2024 campaign winds up, Democrats knock Senate candidate Eric Hovde on abortion record \n\n \n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nOpponents and supporters of abortion access testify against 14-week ban \n\n \n\n\n\nGOP bill would restrict abortions after 14 weeks \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
