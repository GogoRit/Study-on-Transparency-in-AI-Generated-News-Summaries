Can it win it back?Eduardo Campos LimaOctober 05, 2020Pro-life supporters pray during a 2019 protest outside the local congress in Oaxaca, Mexico. In late July, Mexico's bishops called on Catholics to speak out ahead of a ruling from the country's Supreme Court, which could lead to a nationwide decriminalization of abortion. (CNS photo/Jorge Luis Plata, Reuters)Feminist social movements have been mobilizing to decriminalize abortion in Latin American nations in recent years, provoking clashes with pro-life movements and the Catholic Church across the region. The latest campaigns have begun in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and the Mexican state of Veracruz, where legislative changes to allow abortion are being debated.Today, only Cuba, Guyana, French Guyana and Uruguay, as well as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, allow abortion without condition in the first weeks of a pregnancy. In some Latin American countries, women can terminate pregnancy only under three conditions: if the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother\u2019s health, if the fetus has a fatal condition or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.On Sept. 28, the Day of Global Action for Legal and Safe Abortion, women\u2019s groups marched in several countries to press for the legalization of abortion. Activists for access to contraception and abortion charge that even when national laws allow abortion under limited conditions in countries like Brazil and Colombia, women face extralegal obstacles as hospitals and doctors refuse to perform the procedure or create technical barriers.The church has been campaigning against further legislative liberalization of abortion laws as evangelical Protestant groups and right-wing movements\u00a0join\u00a0the debate on the contentious issue.\u201cIn [the Mexican state of] Veracruz, hospitals have historically failed to obey the law and give access to safe abortion to girls with ages varying from 10 to 14 who had been raped,\u201d said Luz Estrada, the coordinator for gender violence and human rights issues for Mexican Catholics for the Right to Decide.The church has been campaigning against further legislative liberalization of abortion laws throughout Latin America, making its case for the sacredness of life from conception. Now new social actors, especially evangelical Protestant groups and new right-wing movements in the region, have joined the debate on the contentious issue.The Catholic Church in Latin America has surrendered the leading role it once had in the cultural dialogue over abortion, according to Franciso Borba Ribeiro Neto, the director of the Pontifical Catholic University\u2019s Center of Faith and Culture in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. While most people in Latin America \u201csee abortion as a terrible kind of murder,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a rift in value and practice.\u201d At the same time people repudiate abortion, they believe that society should not seek to punish a person who undergoes the procedure.\u201cCatholics in general have adopted a stern condemnation of abortion over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. But the church\u2019s position did not allow for nuance, allowing left-wing movements some success in advocating for liberalization of abortion laws. As the cultural influence of Catholic groups that defended life diminished, new pro-life organizations, not connected to the church, emerged.New protagonists in the debate have goals that are focused as much on right-wing political success as they are on pro-life principles.The Peruvian group Con mis hijos no se metas (\u201cDon\u2019t mess with my children\u201d) and the Ecuadorian umbrella movement Consejo de Resistencia Fe, Vida y Familia (\u201cCouncil of Resistance Faith, Life and Family\u201d), among others, have been active in campaigns against same-sex marriage, \u201cgender ideology\u201d in schools and abortion.Church officials and cultural commentators say these new protagonists in the debate have goals that are focused as much on right-wing political success as they are on pro-life principles.The Peruvian journalist Jonathan Castro reports that some of these emerging movements have been encouraged and trained by conservative organizations in the United States. His article reveals that Christian Rosas, the spokesperson for Con mis hijos no se metas, attended a training session in 2018 sponsored by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian organization, in the United States.Mr. Castro\u2019s story was published as part of the Columbia University\u2013led project Transnacionales de la fe (\u201cTransnationals of Faith\u201d), a consortium of Latin American newspapers investigating the connections between United States conservative groups and the new Christian right in Latin America.\u201cNow there\u2019s a big orchestration of Christian churches taking part in the debate on sexual and reproductive women\u2019s rights, sometimes leading to openly political movements,\u201d said Aura Cuasapud, legal advisor of the Colombian branch of Catholics for the Right to Choose, an organization inspired by Catholics for Choice in the United States but which operates autonomously in Latin America. \u201cMany of those groups are equipped with arguments that come from the United States.\u201dIn the Dominican Republic, the Most Rev. Victor Masalles, bishop of Ban\u00ed and one of the most active Catholic leaders in the campaign against abortion, agrees that over the past few years the civic discussion of abortion has been transformed by such movements, and he worries that some in the church could unwittingly be drawn into political entanglements. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a pro-Trump movement of fundamentalist nature, so the left wing has been accusing us of being far-right-wingers,\u201d he lamented.\u201cThe same way society discards the poor or the elders\u2014as is happening now, during the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014life in the mother\u2019s womb is sometimes discarded. But we mustn\u2019t discard anybody.\u201d At the same time, evangelical Protestant organizations have been trying to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of the Catholic Church, said Bishop Masalles. \u201cWe have a circumstantial unity with them during pro-life campaigns, but they want to gain ground on us,\u201d he told America.The Dominican Republic is one of the few Latin American or Caribbean countries where abortion is totally forbidden. But a debate on its decriminalization\u2014under the three usual conditions\u2014resumed recently as part of the process of approval of a new penal code. After much pressure from the pro-life movement, Dominican legislators decided to address the idea of decriminalizing abortion in separate legislation.The Rev. Mario de la Cruz, episcopal vicar of the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, fears that decriminalizing abortion even just under the usual three exceptions could lead to the eventual acceptance of elective abortion in Dominican society. Bishop Masalles agrees.\u201cThe three conditions allow for broad application. It\u2019s a matter of interpretation,\u201d he said.Father de la Cruz said that the church will keep campaigning against any change in the current law; at the same time it will try to raise consciousness of the sacredness of life in society. \u201cThe same way society discards the poor or the elders\u2014as is happening now, during the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014life in the mother\u2019s womb is sometimes discarded. But we mustn\u2019t discard anybody,\u201d he said.In Ecuador, rather than perceiving new voices on the issue as a threat, the Catholic Church has aligned itself with a broader pro-life coalition that includes evangelicals. \u201cWe have exclusively Catholic initiatives that have led programs in defense of life and family for years. But at times we open space for movements of our evangelical brothers. We know that each one of us has a unique way of defending life,\u201d Archbishop Luis Herrera of Guayaquil told America.The church in the region missed an early opportunity to promote a civic discussion of women\u2019s rights and protection, but that remains one possible way to resume a lead role in the pro-life struggle.In 2019, an attempted reform of Ecuador\u2019s penal code included the decriminalization of abortion in cases of rape and incest and if the fetus had a terminal condition. After much pressure from pro-life campaigners, the reform was not approved. Abortion remained legal in the country only if the mother\u2019s health was in danger or if the pregnancy was the result of the violation of a woman with mental disability.In August 2020, another controversy regarding abortion began when the Ecuadorian Congress approved new health care legislation. One of the articles of the new law requires that women arriving at a hospital while terminating a pregnancy must be treated as obstetrics emergencies and that hospitals and medical professionals cannot deny assistance in such cases.\u201cThat article doesn\u2019t promote nor decriminalize abortion. But there\u2019s a risk of leaving an open door to justify abortion,\u201d argued Mr. Cabrera. \u201cSome groups promote abortion using chemical substances, for instance. They could transform a procedure like that in an emergency and a doctor would be obliged to assist the patient [and complete the procedure],\u201d he said.The church and other members of the pro-life alliance have campaigned for a veto of that provision from President Len\u00edn Moreno. \u201cPeople worried about their survival during the pandemic. They took advantage of the lack of social reaction. But we have been mobilized for a veto,\u201d Mr. Cabrera said. On Sept. 25, the president vetoed the new bill.In Mexico, the clash between pro-life and pro-choice groups has been partially connected to party politics. In July, the State of Veracruz was at the center of a national dispute when the Supreme Court reviewed a petition from Catholics for the Right to Decide and other groups to decriminalize abortion there during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.In Mexico\u00a0\u201cwe fear that if the issue of abortion goes back to discussion in court, it might end up being decriminalized, first in Veracruz, then in the whole country.\u201dAccording to the Rev. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Suazo, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Xalapa, where the campaign has concentrated, the effort was initially begun by state legislators from Morena, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s left-wing party.\u201cIn 2017, they tried to change the law in Veracruz to decriminalize abortion under any circumstances during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. But the change was considered unconstitutional,\u201d he told America. An attempt to change state legislation followed. The case ended up in Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court, which rejected the petition to decriminalize abortion in July.But only technical aspects of the appeal factored in the court\u2019s decision, according to Father Suazo. Now \u201cwe fear that if the issue of abortion goes back to discussion in court, it might end up being decriminalized, first in Veracruz, then in the whole country.\u201dAccording to Father Suazo, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s Secretariat of Home Affairs has been promoting initiatives to decriminalize abortion in many states. \u201cThe current administration has a plan to liberate abortion, impose gender ideology and allow same-sex unions,\u201d Father Suazo alleged. He hopes Mexicans will oppose the Morena party in the 2021 legislative and municipal elections.Abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is currently allowed in Mexico City and Oaxaca. According to Ms. Estrada, women from across Mexico travel to the capital to undergo abortion procedures.RELATED STORIES How Covid-19 made sex trafficking in Latin America much worseEduardo Campos LimaMs. Estrada said that she and other members of Catholics for the Right to Decide have been threatened and verbally attacked. \u201cWhat [the pro-life campaigners] see as a type of international conspiracy for the decriminalization of abortion is in fact the progress of women\u2019s rights,\u201d she argued. The group\u2019s intention, she explained, is to \u201cfight for women\u2019s health and dignity.\u201dAll the same, \u201cabortion should be a woman\u2019s last resort,\u201d she added.In Latin America, where high rates of violence against women have been tolerated, there is an enduring sense that men own women\u2019s bodies, according to the Brazilian feminist theologian Luiza Tomita. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to discuss sexuality and reproductive rights in the region. Such a patriarchalism comes from our colonial times and is still alive,\u201d she said.The church in the region missed an early opportunity to promote a civic discussion of women\u2019s rights and protection, but that remains one possible way to resume a lead role in the pro-life struggle, said Mr. Ribeiro Neto.\u201cThe church must show solidarity to pregnant women in crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are movements throughout Latin America to support women and avoid abortion, with programs that include adoption, foster care and all kinds of help.\u201dBy stressing such concrete actions in support of pregnant women, he said, the church could avoid the U.S.-style politicization of abortion that now haunts the pro-life movement in Latin America, allowing the church to propose its own views on how to deal with unplanned pregnancies.More: Abortion / Latin AmericaEduardo Campos LimaEduardo Campos Lima is a freelance journalist who contributes from\u00a0S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Show Comments ()  Join the conversation: Login or create an account Before you can comment, you need to update your profile to include your first and last name, as required in our comments policy.
