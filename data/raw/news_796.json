(AP) \u2014 Most registered voters in Tennessee want exceptions for rape or incest in the state\u2019s sweeping abortion ban, but they largely don\u2019t know the specifics of what\u2019s in the law as it stands today, according to new Vanderbilt University polling.The disconnect comes in a state that votes consistently for Republicans and has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. Three out of four people polled think that abortion should be legal if the pregnancy results from rape or incest, an exception that doesn\u2019t exist in current law. But fewer than 1 in 5 were able to pick which of the statements Vanderbilt provided that most closely described the current abortion law\u2019s requirements, according to Vanderbilt pollsters. Asked about six descriptions, 36% of respondents said they did not know enough to say what the law entails, while 23% chose the option \u201cillegal except in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.\u201d\n\nTennessee\u2019s ban doesn\u2019t have an explicit exemption for the mother\u2019s life. Instead, it shifts the burden to the doctor to make a case in criminal court, if charged with a felony under the law, that an abortion was needed to save the mother\u2019s life or spare her from irreversible, severe impairment. \nIn legalese, the ban spells out an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d to protect the mother\u2019s life, which Republican officials say translates to making exceptions to protect pregnant women\u2019s health, even though it leaves the onus on the doctor to prove that the abortion was necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey passed the law in 2019, only directing it to take effect if the Supreme Court struck down the Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling.The law makes performing an abortion a Class C felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.The views of Tennesseans on rape and incest exceptions to the abortion ban \u2014 which even saw support from 6 out of 10 Republicans \u2014 echo, at least in part, what voters voiced nationally when they cast ballots last month. \n\nNationwide, about two-thirds of voters say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 90,000 voters across the country. Only about 1 in 10 say abortion should be illegal in all cases.About 6 in 10 also say the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision in June overturning Roe v. Wade made them dissatisfied or angry, compared with fewer who say they were happy or satisfied.While elections nationwide left the country with a split control of Congress, Republicans continued to cruise in Tennessee. Republican Gov. Bill Lee won in a landslide, despite facing attacks from his Democratic opponent over the abortion law, which he supported and signed. Through a redistricting maneuver that carved up Democratic Nashville to favor the GOP, Republicans also managed to gain a seat in the U.S. House without any close calls. The GOP kept its supermajorities in the state Legislature, as well.Additionally, this year\u2019s Vanderbilt poll found that 37% of those surveyed said they were \u201cpro-choice,\u201d or in favor of abortion rights, up 15 percentage points from a decade ago, when only 22% favored \u201cpro-choice\u201d policies. Support for a \u201cpro-life,\u201d or anti-abortion, position fell from 46% in 2012 to 36% now. \n\nIn Tennessee, where voters don\u2019t register by political party, those polled indicated they would be widely on board with abortion restrictions if they were significantly scaled back. Nearly 7 in 10 of voters polled \u2014 including almost 1 in 2 Democrats \u2014 indicated they think \u201cabortion should be illegal after 15 weeks except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\u201dJohn Geer, dean of Vanderbilt\u2019s College of Arts and Science and co-director of the poll, said that nationally, he didn\u2019t think information got out as effectively as it could have on various post-Roe abortion restrictions. \u201cA lot of what is going on, I think, is that legislators are reacting to where the competition lies,\u201d Geer said. \u201cAnd because of the redistricting and because Tennessee is such a Republican state, their main threat is from their flank, not from the center. Consequently, they are prepared to support these kinds of laws, even though they know that probably the broader public is not necessarily in support of them.\u201d\n\nTo date, Lee has downplayed concerns that the abortion ban\u2019s current language surrounding exemptions has sparked confusion and fear from the medical community. As a vocal opponent of abortion, Lee has maintained that doctors can use \u201ctheir best judgment\u201d to save the life of the mother.Many medical officials in Tennessee disagree with Lee\u2019s assessment and have since reached out to lawmakers, pleading for them to add more flexibility and clarification. In response, a small pocket of Republican lawmakers have begun advocating for some exceptions to be added to the current ban. It\u2019s unknown how successful those efforts will be when the General Assembly meets next month.Vanderbilt conducted the survey of 1,180 registered Tennessee voters between Nov. 8 and Nov. 28. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
