(Photo by Sergio Flores/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Republican Wisconsin lawmakers have introduced a bill that mirrors the Texas ban on most abortions, complete with a $10,000 bounty \u201creward\u201d for any citizen who sues someone providing an abortion. The bill makes no exception for victims of rape or incest.\n  Sen. Julian Bradley (R-Franklin)\nBill authors Sen. Julian Bradley (R-Franklin) and Rep. Donna Rozar (R-Marshfield) have drafted the bill, apparently unwilling to wait until this summer when many are predicting that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, which would bring back an even more stringent law in Wisconsin that makes all abortion a felony crime in Wisconsin due to a 1849 statute still on the books.\n\u201cTime and time again, the GOP members of the Legislature have demonstrated just how far they are willing to go to restrict access to abortion,\u201d said Mike Murray, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. \u201cFor Republican members of the state Legislature, criminalizing abortion in Wisconsin isn\u2019t enough. They are now doubling down on banning abortion through this new, dangerous Texas-style abortion ban \u2026 along with a $10,000 bounty reward for people to sue anyone who provides abortion care.\u201d\nHe points out that in Texas the law has amounted to \u201cpractically a complete ban on abortion because it would prohibit abortion before almost anyone knows that they are pregnant.\u201d\nThe GOP authors misleadingly label it a \u201cfetal heartbeat bill\u201d with language attempting to designate exactly how health care providers would have to identify a heartbeat in a fetus, \u201cbased on the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child and condition of the woman and her pregnancy.\u201d Doctors explain that there is no cardiovascular system or heartbeat that early in a pregnancy and what is being heard is an electrical pulse.\n  Rep. Donna Rozar | Wisconsin Eye\nThe bill also requires the Medical Examining Board to investigate any physician \u201calleged\u201d to have preformed an abortion for \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d according to the Legislative Reference Bureau analysis on the bill.\nThe bill is a match with Texas\u2019 law with one slight difference, says Michelle Velasquez, an attorney and Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin\u2019s director of legal advocacy and services. It currently does not contain the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d clause from the Texas statute. That applies to someone who drives a person to get an abortion or provides money to cover costs. Both the Texas law and the Wisconsin bill and 1849 law all target the health care workers providing the abortion.\n\u201cIn practicality that has essentially cut off abortion in Texas because most people won\u2019t even know that they\u2019re pregnant until at least that time frame,\u201d says Velasquez. \u201cSo we\u2019ve seen the real human tragedy in Texas unfold as people have to access care, if they can, out of state hundreds and\u00a0 hundreds of miles away \u2026 using, perhaps, all the resources they have to do that.\u201d\u00a0 Velasquez says that the only other two options left for women seeking an abortion in Texas are being forced to carry the pregnancy to term, or \u201cthey will figure out a way, an unsafe way perhaps, to terminate their pregnancy on their own.\u201d She adds, \u201cWe have no reason to think that this kind of law in Wisconsin would have any different impact.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nThe bill follows nine other bills extensively restricting abortion that Republicans have passed over the past three years, all of which have been vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has joined other attorneys general in amicus briefs that seek to block the Texas ban.\n\u201cSeverely restricting reproductive freedom, as this bill proposes, would endanger the health of women in Wisconsin, and I have joined amicus briefs in support of blocking a similar Texas law,\u201d says Kaul, commenting on the Wisconsin bill draft. \u201cWisconsin should not follow Texas by passing this harmful legislation.\u201d\nSen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) notes the irony that Wisconsin already has a more stringent law than the Texas-style ban on the books.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s even crazier [than the proposed bill] is that we already have an even more extreme law on the books, a complete abortion ban without exceptions, from 1849,\u201d says Roys. \u201cIf and when Roe v. Wade is overturned, our law is already sitting on our statute books waiting to be enforced.\u201d\nDemocratic lawmakers have introduced the Abortion Rights Preservation Act which would remove Wisconsin\u2019s 172-year-old criminal abortion statute. Asked about how the statute from the time of Wisconsin statehood might interact with a six-week ban of the type Rozar and Franklin propose if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade and potentially returns control to the states if it were to pass, Velasquez says that remains to be seen. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know, but they\u2019ll both have that same practical effect, the same real impact\u201d of limiting women to traveling, carrying the pregnancy to term or seeking to end the pregnancy themselves.\n  Sen. Kelda Roys speaks at Roe v. Wade anniversary news conference 1/19/22 | WisEye\nFor Roys, the new bill only highlights the importance of the governor\u2019s race in Wisconsin. Candidate and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was endorsed Thursday by Wisconsin Family Action PAC. \u201cTime and again, Rebecca has proven she is pro-life \u2014 that she is dedicated to the biological reality that life begins at conception and deserves protection from that moment,\u201d Executive Director Julaine Appling said in a statement. The group\u2019s endorsement coincided with former U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson officially entering the 2022 governor\u2019s race on Thursday morning, creating a higher profile Republican primary.\n\u201cRadical Rebecca Kleefisch has long wanted to outlaw all abortions \u2014 and if she becomes governor, Wisconsin will be the next Texas thanks to our gerrymandered, anti-choice Legislature,\u201d says Roys, the Senate author of the Abortion Rights Preservation Act. She adds that this stance ignores public opinion: \u201cDespite the overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites and Americans wanting abortion to remain safe and legal, Republican politicians are doing everything they can to make it a crime.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Murray also sees the mere introduction of the bill as a threat, despite the fact that in the current session any such bill that passes is nearly certain to be vetoed by Evers. In fact, at a new conference Evers held Thursday on the state surplus, he was asked about the bill and replied that he hasn\u2019t read it, but reiterated his support for a woman\u2019s right to make their own decisions \u201cin consultation with their doctors,\u201d saying it was not something legislators should intervene in and said the legislation \u201csounds like\u2026 a non-starter.\u201d\n\u201cFor the thousands of women who have been forced to travel hundreds of miles outside of Texas at great cost to get the care they need and for those who have been forced to carry a pregnancy against their will, the Texas law has been devastating,\u201d he added. \u201cOur elected leaders need to hear from their constituents that this attack on reproductive freedom will not be tolerated. Everyone deserves the ability to make their own health care decisions and access the health care they need \u2013 including abortion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXTwo  Wisconsin GOP lawmakers look to duplicate Texas\u2019 6-week-abortion ban\nby Melanie Conklin, Wisconsin Examiner January 27, 2022\nTwo  Wisconsin GOP lawmakers look to duplicate Texas\u2019 6-week-abortion ban\nby Melanie Conklin, Wisconsin Examiner January 27, 2022\n Two Republican Wisconsin lawmakers have introduced a bill that mirrors the Texas ban on most abortions, complete with a $10,000 bounty \u201creward\u201d for any citizen who sues someone providing an abortion.
