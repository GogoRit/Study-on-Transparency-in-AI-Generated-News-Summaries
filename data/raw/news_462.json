Now, the Nashville district attorney said he won\u2019t enforce the law, arguing that requiring doctors to provide the information is unconstitutional.\u00a0The state this summer passed the law, which goes into effect on October 1, as part of a package of measures imposing restrictions on abortion, including a \u201cheartbeat\u201d ban, which generally restricts abortion after six weeks. The law will require abortion providers to post signs informing patients that a medication abortion\u2014which requires two pills taken up to 48 hours apart\u2014can be reversed halfway through by forgoing the second pill and taking a large dose of a different medication. Doctors will also have to tell patients that the procedure can be reversed.Failure to take these steps could result in felony charges, fines, and up to six years in prison.Six other states besides Tennessee require abortion providers to tell patients medication abortions can be reversed. In two other states\u2014Oklahoma and North Dakota\u2014courts have blocked the laws from going into effect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, the ACLU of Tennessee, and five Tennessee abortion providers sued over the law last month, saying the new notification requirements violate doctors\u2019 First Amendment rights protecting them from \u201ccompelled speech\u201d by \u201cforc[ing] physicians \u2026 to communicate a government-ordered message with which they and the overwhelming consensus of the medical profession disagree.\u201dThe groups claim that the process of medication abortion reversal \u201cis wholly unsupported by reliable scientific evidence and has been rejected by the field\u2019s trusted medical authorities, including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u201d They also point to studies that raise concerns that maintaining a pregnancy after starting the process of a drug-induced abortion may cause second-trimester miscarriages, stillbirths, and birth defects.The suit was filed in federal district court against the state attorney general, the state commissioner of the Department of Health, and four district attorneys of the state\u2019s most populous counties. The state attorney general has argued against the lawsuit, stating that the new law does not violate the abortion providers\u2019 rights to free speech because they are still allowed to say they disagree with the mandated statement about abortion reversals.Three of the four district attorneys named in the lawsuit submitted statements that seemed to agree with the attorney general\u2019s position, saying the \u201cprovision is silent regarding criminal liability for an abortion provider who provides the required disclosures but expresses disagreement.\u201dBut Glenn Funk, the Democratic district attorney in Davidson County, which includes Nashville, last week independently filed a statement siding with the abortion providers. Funk said Attorney General Herbert Slater, a Republican, refused to file the declaration, even though the attorney general usually represents local prosecutors in this kind of litigation.\u00a0Funk wrote that he does not think requiring doctors to provide information about abortion reversals is constitutional and \u201ctherefore [he] will not enforce those provisions.\u201d\u201cAs long as I am the elected district attorney for the 20th Judicial District, I will not prosecute any woman who chooses to have a medical procedure to terminate a pregnancy or any medical doctor who performs this procedure at the request of their patient,\u201d\u00a0 Funk wrote. \u201cFurther, I will not prosecute or sanction an abortion provider who states, verbally and/or in writing disagreement with the disclosures required by the legislature.\u201d\u201cWith regard to reproductive issues, the criminal law must not be used by the state to exercise control over a woman\u2019s body,\u201d he concluded.Republican Gov. Bill Lee responded to Funk on Twitter, although he didn\u2019t mention the Nashville prosecutor by name. \"A district attorney purposefully disregarding current, duly enacted laws by the legislature is a grave matter that threatens our justice system and has serious consequences,\" Lee said. \"The rule of law is the cornerstone of our legal system, and we all take an oath to uphold the law, not to pick and choose what laws to follow based on politics or personal feelings.\"Reproductive rights groups praised Funk\u2019s declaration. Ashley Coffield, the president of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi, said in a statement that the Nashville DA had \u201cchanneled the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\u201d who died on September 18.\u00a0Funk \u201cmade a clear and unequivocal statement that politicians should not be criminalizing doctors and forcing them to spread false information with patients,\" Coffield said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Coleman is the assistant editor for\u00a0Route Fifty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Health care Case Studies\n            \n\n\n\n\n                  Powered By\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse The Atlas full case study database or read more case studies about\n            Health care.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Takoma Park Allocates More than 50% of its ARPA Spending Plan to Advancing Equity\n                          \n\n\n\n                          Takoma Park, MD\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Harris County uses technology to modernize law enforcement\u2019s role in crisis intervention\n                          \n\n\n\n                          Harris County, TX\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Rural Indiana county uses ARPA funds to build a fiber network to increase digital equity\n                          \n\n\n\n                          Vanderburgh County, IN\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                BROWSE LOCAL GOV CASE STUDIES\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\n\n\nNEXT STORY:\n\n              Health on Wheels: Tricked-Out RVs Deliver Addiction Treatment to Rural Communities\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 states band together to phase out fossil fuel heating in homes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Want to reform housing?
