Minority Leader Janet Bewley at the podium in the Assembly chamber surrounded by  (left to right) Rep. Francesca Hong, Dr. Eliza Bennett and Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer. Democrats called a press conference on the day Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 called a special session to take up repealing Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban. Republicans gaveled in and out of the session without taking action | Photo by Luther Wu\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican leaders of the Senate and Assembly gaveled in and out of a special session called by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in less than 30 seconds Wednesday afternoon, rejecting the governor\u2019s call to discuss repealing Wisconsin\u2019s 173-year-old abortion ban, which does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.\nAnticipating that the Republicans would end the session without debate, as they have numerous times when Evers has called previous special sessions, Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley (D-Mason) criticized Republicans\u2019 lack of will to repeal the 1849 law at a press conference in the Capitol Wednesday morning.\u00a0 \u201cI agree with the will of the majority of Wisconsinites that abortion should be legal in all or most cases,\u201d Bewley said. She and Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) cited Marquette University Law School polling data showing that more than half of Wisconsinites consistently say they want abortion to remain legal, even as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the next few days striking down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing abortion rights.\n\u201cSome states in the U.S. will still have reproductive freedom when or if Roe gets overturned, because their legislators have the will to act,\u201d Bewley said. \u201cUnfortunately, Wisconsin will probably not be one of those states because the Republicans in our Legislature don\u2019t have the will to act on behalf of the people of Wisconsin.\u201d\nEvers released a statement slamming Republicans in the Legislature after they closed the special session without debate. \u201cTime and time again, the people of Wisconsin have asked Republican legislators to do what they are elected to do \u2014 to take action on pressing issues facing our state, to do the right thing, and to help the people we are elected to serve,\u201d Evers said in the statement. \u201cToday, they once again failed to muster the courage to perform that simple duty.\u201d\n  Protesters at the Wisconsin State Capitol on June 22, 2022 | Photo by Ruth Conniff\n\u201cRepublicans\u2019 refusal to act will have real and severe consequences for all of us and the people we care most about who could see their ability to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions stripped away from them,\u201d Evers added, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to rule \u201cany day now.\u201d\u00a0\nSenate President Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), who gaveled in and out of the special session on the Senate side, over the vociferous protests of Democrats, tweeted afterwards: \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court has yet to issue their opinion yet the Governor called a Special Session. This is nothing more than a calculated campaign move & the exact reason why the Legislature isn\u2019t in session during campaign season. He\u2019s not fooling anyone with this political stunt.\u201d\nOutside the Assembly and Senate chambers, the Capitol rotunda was filled with hundreds of people wearing pink Planned Parenthood T-shirts, chanting, \u201cNot the court, not the state, only we decide our fate.\u201d\n  Jessica Marshall and her son Henry protest at the Capitol on June 22, 2022 | Ruth Conniff\nJessica Marshall of Madison brought her 5-month-old son Henry. \u201cWe\u2019re here because we believe that abortion is health care,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think 200-year-old laws should be used to make decisions in 2022.\u201d\nAnother protester, Bonnie Stalker, said she came because \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of this happening again. I have two daughters and they ought to be able to have appropriate health care and choose what they do with their bodies. It just saddens me that we\u2019ve come full circle.\u201d\nDespite the failure of the special session to produce results, Rep. Mark Sprietzer, who joined the protesters in the rotunda, said it was a worthwhile effort to call attention to what will happen in Wisconsin when Roe v. Wade falls.\n\u201cEven people who followed the leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court may not understand that we have a criminal abortion ban on the books,\u201d Sprietzer said.\u00a0\n  Bonnie Stalker protests at the Capitol in Madison | Ruth Conniff\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos has expressed his support for exceptions to Wisconsin\u2019s felony abortion ban in cases of rape and incest, \u201cso he should do something about it while Gov. Evers is here to sign a bill,\u201d Spreitzer said. \u201cBecause the Republican candidates for governor say they don\u2019t support those exceptions.\u201d\nDuring the Democrats\u2019 morning press conference, OB-GYN doctor Eliza Bennett spoke about the difficulty of having to choose between providing care to her patients and facing a possible felony conviction under Wisconsin\u2019s abortion ban if it comes back into effect.\u00a0\n\u201cMy pregnant patients are full people entitled to self-determination, and they arrive at their decisions to end pregnancies for many different reasons,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf this law from 173 years ago comes back into effect \u2014 when women had minimal rights, no real agency or autonomy \u2014 they will be taken back to that time. They will lose their autonomy. I will lose my ability to morally and ethically care for my patients. Or, if I choose to continue my practice, caring for them in a moral and ethical manner, I will face criminal charges and jail time,\u201d Bennett said.\nNoting that the only exception under Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 law is a provision allowing abortion to save the life of the mother, Bennett added, \u201cThe public may not realize this, but we as physicians do not know exactly when our patients are going to die.\u201d\nWhen patients, \u201cespecially young, pregnant women,\u201d face severe complications in pregnancy, \u201cwe do not know specifically who will die for sure; often we do not know until it is too late,\u201d she said. \u201cOur standard practice at this point is to counsel patients to offer options, discuss risks and allow patients to choose the best care for themselves.\u201d\n  Dr. Eliza Bennett discusses Wisconsin\u2019s impending abortion ban | Photo by Luther Wu\nFacing the prospect of working under the 173-year-old Wisconsin abortion ban, Bennett said, she and her colleagues had been discussing what it will mean for them if Roe falls. \u201cDo patients need to be so sick that death is nearly upon them? If I perform an abortion prior to that, will I be jailed? Fined? Will I lose my license? If I don\u2019t, will I be negligent? Will my patients suffer irreparable harm? \u2026 This is an untenable situation for physicians and patients.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXRepublicans leave Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban in place\nby Ruth Conniff, Wisconsin Examiner June 23, 2022\nRepublicans leave Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban in place\nby Ruth Conniff, Wisconsin Examiner June 23, 2022\n Republican leaders of the Senate and Assembly gaveled in and out of a special session called by Democratic Gov.
