(photo: Courtesy photo / Houck family)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nNation\nOctober 13, 2022\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two pro-life fathers were recently arrested at their homes by FBI agents with guns drawn in front of their wives and children. One had an alleged altercation last year with an abortion facility escort he said was harassing his young son. The other father allegedly assisted a group of pro-lifers praying and singing hymns outside an abortion business more than a year ago.\u00a0\nPeter Breen, vice president and senior counsel at the Thomas More Society, told the Register that these incidents \u201cpoint to a weaponized Department of Justice that is seeking to intimidate pro-life people and people of faith in this country,\u201d and they \u201cshould outrage every American, no matter where they stand on abortion.\u201d \u00a0\nThe charges against Mark Houck, a 48-year-old Catholic father of seven, stem from an incident that took place on Oct. 13, 2021, in which a 72-year-old facility escort, Bruce Love, approached Houck and his son, who were peacefully praying about 50 feet from the center, Breen said. According to Breen, the escort made \u201ccrude references, sexual and otherwise,\u201d to Houck\u2019s 12-year-old son. An altercation ensued in which Houck allegedly shoved Love.\nBreen said the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute the incident, so Love filed a private criminal complaint, which was dismissed when Love repeatedly failed to show up in court. However, Houck was informed weeks later that federal prosecutors were investigating and that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office wanted to speak to his attorney.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nA Thomas More Society attorney advised the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in a June email, Breen said, that, based on relevant case law in the same district, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act that Houck was facing charges under doesn\u2019t apply to one-off altercations unrelated to abortion access. The attorneys also agreed to bring Houck in \u201cwherever they want him to be brought in and whatever date and time is appropriate.\u201d\u00a0\nBreen said they received no reply until they were notified that Houck had been taken into custody on Sept. 23. He said the agents had \u201clong guns pointed at Mark and his family, they came and pounded on his door,\u201d and one gunman \u201cwas pointing a gun inside the house.\u201d Added Breen, \u201cHis wife is there, looking on, along with his seven children at the top of the staircase. She\u2019s holding them back.\u201d\u00a0\nHouck\u2019s wife, Ryan-Marie Houck, demanded to see a warrant, which the agents initially refused to provide, but did provide one to her. \u201cA SWAT team of about 25 came to my house with about 15 vehicles and started pounding on our door,\u201d she told Catholic News Agency following the incident.\u00a0\nThe FBI\u2019s Philadelphia office challenged her account, telling Catholic News Agency in a statement that \u201cno SWAT Team or SWAT operators were involved. FBI agents knocked on Mr. Houck\u2019s front door, identified themselves as FBI agents, and asked him to exit the residence. He did so and was taken into custody without incident pursuant to an indictment.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, an FBI spokesman declined to answer Catholic News Agency\u2019s questions about the number of law enforcement personnel at the scene and whether any drew their weapons and pointed them at the family.\n\u00a0\nDOJ Media Spin\n\u201cWe found out on the day of the arrest that the Department of Justice was running the media operation out of Washington, D.C., not out of the local U.S. Attorney's Office,\u201d Breen said, \u201cand we learned that a senior trial attorney from the Department of Justice had actually been running point on this case from the beginning.\u201d \u00a0\nIn its press release regarding the arrest, the DOJ stated that there were \u201ctwo separate incidents\u201d involving Houck and Bruce Love (referred to as B.L.); \u201cin the first incident, B.L. was attempting to escort two patients exiting the clinic, when the defendant forcefully shoved B.L. to the ground. In the second incident, the defendant verbally confronted B.L. and forcefully shoved B.L. to the ground in front of the Planned Parenthood center, causing injuries to B.L. that required medical attention.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBreen said that the first allegation appears to be fabricated and without evidence. He pointed out that in Love\u2019s private criminal complaint, he only alleged one incident of physical contact, not two.\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, along with 10 of his colleagues in the Senate, wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Sept. 28 with a series of questions, including, \u201cIn light of Mr. Houck\u2019s alleged cooperation with federal authorities, what factors led to the Justice Department and FBI executing an arrest warrant against him instead of using less aggressive tactics, including a summons to appear?\u201d\u00a0\nThe U.S. senators wrote that the \u201cextraordinary fact pattern\u201d in Houck\u2019s arrest \u201crequires additional information from the Justice Department and the FBI relating to why Mr. Houck was not allowed to self-report for his arrest and arraignment and whether political considerations were made to approve and execute the search warrant.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA Second FBI Raid\nAnother home arrest occurred just weeks after Houck\u2019s, at the home of pro-life leader Paul Vaughn, a father of 11, who recorded a video of fellow pro-life advocates singing and praying outside a Tennessee abortion facility in March 2021.\u00a0\nAccording to the Thomas More Society, he \u201cwas never arrested by the local police\u201d and \u201cwas recording the protest and serving as a liaison between life advocates and the police to ensure the safety of all involved.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers involved in the protest were arrested for blocking the doors to the abortion facility; they were arrested at the time of the blockade. Yet Vaughn had FBI agents appear at his house more than a year later to arrest him as he was preparing to take his children to school.\n\u201cHis children were outside,\u201d Breen said. \u201cHe sees a federal agent with a long gun holding his children back, preventing them from moving, and then he is taken into custody.\u201d\u00a0\nHe also referenced a video, taken by Vaughn\u2019s wife, showing the agents refusing to \u201cexplain what happened and why they had to come out with guns against him.\u201d\n\u201cThis idea, that the Department of Justice is now going to come out with big guns against peaceful, pro-life people, is becoming a pattern,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are children involved, and they\u2019re affecting unnecessary arrests with overwhelming force.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said, in the Vaughn case, \u201cthey didn\u2019t just charge him with a FACE violation; they are charging them [the group of pro-lifers] with a violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act, the conspiracy to violate civil rights. A first violation of the FACE Act is supposed to carry a six-month maximum sentence. It\u2019s a misdemeanor at the federal level.\u201d By contrast, the KKK Act \u201chas a 10-year penalty in the federal penitentiary. They\u2019re at risk to go to federal prison longer than many violent criminals, merely for coming together and sitting and singing hymns and prayers in front of an abortion clinic door.\u201d\nBreen added that, subsequent to Roe v. Wade being overturned in June, abortion is not legal in Tennessee anymore, so \u201cwhy would you even charge these people when that abortion clinic isn\u2019t even doing abortions anymore?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHistory of FACE\nBoth men are facing charges under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act of 1994, a law prohibiting \u201cby force, by threat of force, or by physical obstruction\u201d attempts to \u201cinjure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person is \u201cobtaining or providing reproductive health services.\u201d It also prohibits force and threats against \u201cplaces of worship.\u201d\nCatherine Short, chief legal officer at the Life Legal Defense Foundation, told the Register that the FACE Act was passed in the early days of the Clinton administration to address the pro-life organization Operation Rescue by enacting \u201csome really stiff federal penalties on clinic blockades that were organized and massive and did tend to go across state lines in a lot of smaller states.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Short said that, by the time the act was signed in 1994, most organized blockades were discontinued. \u00a0\nShe said what made the measure first of its kind was that \u201ca peaceful blockade could bring in federal felony charges.\u201d She said the measure has been used \u201cprimarily against violence or threats of violence,\u201d even though \u201cwhen you rise to the level of violence and threats of violence, the local authorities are perfectly willing to act in that situation,\u201d using local criminal-assault laws.\nBreen pointed out that the Obama administration targeted peaceful pro-life sidewalk counselors under the FACE Act, \u201cfiling civil injunction lawsuits against peaceful sidewalk counselors and prayer-vigil participants,\u201d because they reasoned that \u201chanding out literature and talking to people\u201d meant obstructing \u201cother people\u2019s access to the abortion clinics.\u201d\nThe Obama administration\u2019s reasoning was rejected by federal judges, including in a case Breen led in Colorado, where pro-lifer Ken Scott faced a $10,000 fine and 10 charges under FACE. The judge ruled in 2012 that the brief discussions Scott had with people handing them leaflets were not \u201cunreasonable delays.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another case that took place in Florida, a federal judge ordered the Obama DOJ to pay $120,000 to pro-life sidewalk counselor Mary Susan Pine, who had FACE charges brought against her after counseling someone through their car window. No proof was provided in that case that Pine had obstructed anyone\u2019s access to the business.\nUltimately, Breen said, the administration backed down, and \u201cwe really didn\u2019t have much problem under the FACE Act with the Obama administration in their second term.\u201d He is hopeful that similar legal victories will occur for the pro-lifers currently facing charges.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSelective Enforcement\nKatie Glenn, state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told the Register that the FACE Act \u201chas a corollary piece that would protect churches and pregnancy centers from the violence they\u2019ve been facing.\u201d\u00a0\nShe said, \u201cWe see that Merrick Garland and the Justice Department are not interested in enforcing the law in that way, even though we know dozens of churches and pregnancy centers have been vandalized and attacked in the last few months, so this is certainly being applied very selectively by the Biden administration to go after people that they perceive as going against their agenda.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nShort said it is striking that the Biden administration hasn\u2019t appeared to make a single arrest related to the vandalism and arson attacks that have occurred at pro-life facilities since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe, noting that \u201carson in general has a very low level for the federal government to get involved.\u201d She pointed out that the activist group Jane\u2019s Revenge has claimed credit for some of these attacks.\nU.S. Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mike Johnson, R-La., recently announced that they were launching a congressional inquiry into the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement of the FACE Act.\u00a0\nIn a letter to Jacqueline Romero, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, they wrote that \u201cthe Department [of Justice] has almost exclusively enforced the FACE Act to protect pro-abortion activists while failing to prosecute harassment and intimidation of pro-life supporters.\u201d They noted that FACE protects \u201cpro-life pregnancy counseling services and any other pregnancy support facility providing reproductive health care.\u201d\u00a0\nThe congressmen cited examples, including the fact that, \u201csince the leak of the draft Dobbs opinion, Jane\u2019s Revenge, a radical anti-life group, \u2018has claimed responsibility for at least 18 arson and vandalism attacks\u2019 on pro-life clinics and organizations. While the FBI says that it is investigating a \u2018series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics,\u2019 to our knowledge, the Department and FBI have not executed any SWAT team dawn raids to make arrests of anti-life activists.\u201d\nGlenn said that \u201cthe Biden administration is sending a message\u201d with their enforcement of FACE and the raids at family homes. \u201cWhen you arrest people in that way, they are definitely doing that intentionally, and it\u2019s because they want people to be afraid to sidewalk counsel.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \npro-lifers\nbiden administration\ndepartment of justice\nat-home raids\nlauretta brown\npaul vaughn\nmark houck\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown
