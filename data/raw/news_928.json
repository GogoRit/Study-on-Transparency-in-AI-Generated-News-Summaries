Across the country, conservative foes of abortion rights have pushed \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d that would ban abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, when an embryo\u2019s cardiac activity can be detected. Journalist Amy Littlefield and a team of law and journalism students from UC Berkeley investigate how this law went from being dismissed as a fringe idea, even by traditional right-to-life groups, to getting enforced in Texas.\u00a0\nWe hear the backstory of right-wing activists who have been pushing toward this moment for more than a decade by embracing an approach that uses science over religion to justify abortion restrictions. But the science is often skewed and misleading. To rally support for a ban on abortion, activist Janet Porter filled press conferences with red heart balloons and sent lawmakers teddy bears that play the sound of heartbeats. Mark Lee Dickson drove across Texas in his Ford pickup getting small towns to pass ordinances that create \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn.\u201d It was all a precursor for what was to come.\u00a0\nNow, the consequences of restricting abortion are playing out in the crowded waiting room of an abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas, where staff are being overwhelmed by patients from Texas. To get an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, Texas patients not only must leave their state, but also navigate the rules of a different state with its own set of laws designed to make abortion hard to access.\u00a0\u00a0\nDig Deeper\nRead Michele Goodwin\u2019s essay: I Was Raped by My Father.

It was named one of the best podcast series of 2021 by the Atlantic, CNN, Rolling Stone, and others. We told that story over the course of seven weeks, and now we\u2019re making it available to you to binge. You can hear the whole series by subscribing to Reveal Presents Mississippi Goddam wherever you get your podcast. Again, that\u2019s Reveal Presents Mississippi Goddam.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal, I\u2019m Ike Sriskandarajah filling in for Al Letson.If you\u2019ve been pregnant or gone with someone to an ultrasound visit, then you might recognize that sound. It can bring up a range of emotions. If you wanted to be pregnant and you\u2019ve experienced that moment where you feel like you\u2019re meeting your baby for the first time, it might feel so joyful to hear that sound. Or maybe you\u2019ve had a pregnancy loss and that sound is hard to hear. And if you\u2019re like me, I\u2019ll be honest, that sound just reminds me of how bummed I was that I couldn\u2019t be there in person to hear those first sounds from my baby. Whatever your experience may be, this idea of a heartbeat is so resonant in our society. I mean, consider Valentine\u2019s Day, how many other vital organs have a holiday devoted to them? So maybe it\u2019s not surprising that the anti-abortion rights movement has latched onto this image and the sound of a beating heart.Shelby Slawson:That [inaudible], that beautiful melody of a tiny life, innocent, vulnerable, and worthy of our protection.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:That\u2019s Texas state representative, Shelby Slawson, one of the sponsors of the so-called heartbeat law. On the other side, scholars like Michelle Goodwin say the whole premise of the heartbeat law is misleading because it\u2019s meant to conjure up an image of this undeveloped embryo as a tiny person with a heart.Michele Goodwin:It\u2019s purposeful in many instances is deeply weaponized as well, but it\u2019s also part of a longstanding cultural expression and also a commercialized one, too, right?Ike Sriskandara\u2026:And in Texas, it\u2019s been effective. In September, the Heartbeat Bill, known as Senate Bill 8, went into effect. It bans an abortion when cardiac activity can be detected during an ultrasound. Dr. Blair Cushing works at the Whole Woman\u2019s Health Clinic in McAllen, Texas. And part of her job is to deliver the life-altering news that a patient can\u2019t move forward with an abortion.Dr. Blair Cushi\u2026:You can sort see this wave of emotions that crosses them of, it could be sadness, it could be fear.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:The signs of a developing cardiovascular system are usually detectable around six weeks. That\u2019s just two weeks after a missed period. And Dr. Cushing says that amount of time gives women very little opportunity to decide whether to keep or end a pregnancy.Dr. Blair Cushi\u2026:I want people to understand that this law has forced so many women into making a more rushed decision than they otherwise would have.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:Sometimes she gives a patient an abortion pill and then watches the patient hesitate.Dr. Blair Cushi\u2026:At least once per session, I will have a patient in exactly that position, that she sits there and she takes the pill from me and she holds it in her hand and then just breaks down, telling me this extreme uncertainty that she has about feeling pressured, like, she knows if she doesn\u2019t do it now, she\u2019s going to lose her chance.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:SB 8 in Texas is not the only abortion law that\u2019s reached the Supreme Court in recent months. A case out of Mississippi is a direct challenge to Roe V. Wade. If the court strikes down that landmark decision, then states could start enforcing even the most extreme anti-abortion laws, which is why we are taking a deep look at the so-called Heartbeat Bill. It\u2019s already led to severe restrictions on abortion in Texas. Patients there have been forced to travel to more than a dozen other states, and some aren\u2019t getting their abortions at all. The question is, how did the so-called Heartbeat Bill succeed when so many other attempts banning abortion early in a pregnancy have failed?For months, we\u2019ve been trying to answer that question with journalist Amy Littlefield and a team of students from the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center and Investigative Reporting Program. As Amy tells us, it\u2019s a combination of savvy marketing and good timing.Amy Littlefield:In 2010, a woman named Janet Porter went to the wake of her former boss at Ohio Right to Life. Like a lot of anti-abortion rights groups, it focused on laws that made abortion harder to access instead of trying to ban it. That day, she realized life was short and she wanted to move faster. Janet wouldn\u2019t talk to me, but in one of her books, she describes how she thought about banning abortion once brainwaves could be detected. In that moment, though, she settled on a heartbeat.Janet Porter:You know, if a heartbeat indicates life, it\u2019s the universally recognized indicator of life, and everyone gets it.Amy Littlefield:That\u2019s Janet years after her epiphany. At this point, she\u2019s running her own organization, Faith to Action. And the heartbeat bills she comes up with would ban abortion in the state of Ohio at about six weeks of pregnancy, even though Roe V. Wade said, states can\u2019t ban abortion until more like six months, when a fetus is viable outside the womb. There\u2019s pushback. Even within her own movement.Michael Gonidak\u2026:Michael Gonidakis. I serve as president of Ohio Right to Life.Amy Littlefield:Mike agrees with Janet\u2019s beliefs, but not her tactics.Michael Gonidak\u2026:We both support life from conception until natural death. I tend to believe there\u2019s different ways of advocating for life. And she tends to believe there\u2019s other ways to do it.Amy Littlefield:Mike tells me back then the Supreme Court would not uphold a law that restrictive. And if the court struck down Janet\u2019s law, it might strike down other anti-abortion laws too.Michael Gonidak\u2026:Right idea, wrong time.Amy Littlefield:But Janet was not deterred. In fact, she went all out, promoting her bill with a music video.Janet Porter:(singing)Amy Littlefield:This is only the beginning. Later, Janet fills a press conference room with red Mylar heart balloons and sends roses and teddy bears that play heartbeat sounds to lawmakers. Mike is watching all of this happen.Michael Gonidak\u2026:I believe we had a plane with banners flying over our state house multiple times on multiple-Amy Littlefield:He\u2019s publicly opposing the bill. The disagreement is splitting the movement in Ohio. Janet would write a chapter in her book, The Enemy Within. A good chunk of it\u2019s about Mike.Michael Gonidak\u2026:I have been on the receiving end of very blunt criticism from Janet. And it\u2019s a free country, everyone one can have an opinion.Amy Littlefield:Mike may not agree with the spectacle of it all, but he can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s helping his cause.Michael Gonidak\u2026:There is value in talking about a beating heart. I think the marketing around that, the messaging around that to people who might not have this as a top of mind issue was brilliant.Amy Littlefield:Janet knows how to get the media\u2019s attention.Janet Porter:We had a mobile ultrasound, we hooked it up there in the committee room.Amy Littlefield:Here is on a show called The Gospel Truth, telling televangelist Andrew Womack, how she brought a fetus to testify at a public hearing.Janet Porter:We put it up on the screen and there you could see the baby\u2019s heart beating. You could see it. They could zoom in on it to make it red and the pro-aborts hated it. Oh my goodness, they were going nuts. Janet and her gimmicks and her stunts and her antics.Amy Littlefield:By 2013, these stunts were getting traction outside Ohio. Versions of her bill managed to pass in North Dakota and Arkansas. But Janet just wasn\u2019t able to get enough Ohio lawmakers behind her bill to pass it, so she ran for office herself.Speaker 9:Janet\u2019s endorsed by Mike Huckabee, Dr. James Dobson, and Gun Owners of America.Janet Porter:I\u2019m Janet Folger Porter and I\u2019ll fight to defund Obamacare and end abortion.Amy Littlefield:Janet lost the primary by a lot. Then Donald Trump got elected and things started to change.Speaker 10:Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed to be an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court.Amy Littlefield:Within a few years, Trump had appointed two justices to the Supreme Court. A lot of people thought the court might be willing to reconsider Roe V. Wade, even Mike Gonidakis.Michael Gonidak\u2026:It all came down to timing and that\u2019s truly it.Amy Littlefield:Ohio Right to Life threw its support behind the bill. In 2019, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signs it. At the signing ceremony, Mike Gonidakis is right there.Michael Gonidak\u2026:Oh, absolutely, front row seat.Amy Littlefield:But Janet who had burned so many bridges during her eight years fighting for the law, she wasn\u2019t even invited. A decade after launching her so-called heartbeat bill, Janet\u2019s gone from annoying Republicans in the Ohio legislature to being welcomed as an honored guest in Texas.Speaker 11:Has Ms. Porter made it into the chamber? I know she\u2019s an expert on this topic and we\u2019re sure excited about having her in the state. Ms. Porter, come on in. You\u2019re in the right place.Amy Littlefield:Janet was in the right place at the right time.Janet Porter:This was a common sense bill. Everybody knows it. If there\u2019s a heartbeat, there\u2019s life. It\u2019s why we instinctively check for a pulse if we\u2019re wondering if someone\u2019s alive or not. It\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve never been to a funeral of somebody with a beating heart.Amy Littlefield:At this same hearing, a woman who testifies tries to copy one of Janet\u2019s stunts.Misty Tate:My name is Misty Tate, and I\u2019m a registered stenographer.Amy Littlefield:Misty works at a crisis pregnancy center. These are places set up to look like real abortion clinics, but they\u2019re actually run by anti-abortion rights groups. They offer free ultrasounds as a way to try to convince people seeking an abortion, to change their minds.Misty Tate:Let\u2019s listen now to two brief recordings that I gathered from work this last week. One recording is from a baby that is protected from abortion because the fetal age is over 20 weeks. And one recording is the heartbeat from a patient and she was six weeks and two days the day that this was recorded. [inaudible] That was one. When you hear these two heartbeats, can you tell the difference?Lori Strakowski:I can.Amy Littlefield:That\u2019s Dr. Lori Strakowski.Lori Strakowski:They do sound slightly different to me, the swishing sound is different in the latter.Amy Littlefield:Dr. Strakowski is a Professor of Radiology at University of California, San Francisco, one of the leading institutions for OB GYN training.Lori Strakowski:My specific interests are primarily in obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound.Amy Littlefield:We asked her to tell us what we\u2019re really hearing on an ultrasound at six weeks.Lori Strakowski:What are we hearing? When we put a stethoscope on the heart of human that is after birth, the lub dub sound that we are hearing are the valves of the heart. That is different. There are no valves yet developed at six weeks.Amy Littlefield:Instead, Dr. Strakowski says what we\u2019re hearing on the six week ultrasound is a vibration of early cardiac cells that will eventually form chambers and valves. This early in a pregnancy, just six weeks in, the ultrasound probe is picking up the movement of those cells.Lori Strakowski:And that movement creates these waves or sound waves that are considered ultrasonic because they are above the audible range that we hear.Amy Littlefield:It\u2019s a lot to take in, but let\u2019s recap. Here\u2019s what Dr. Strakowski is saying. At six weeks, an embryo doesn\u2019t have a heart yet, but it is true the cardiac system is beginning to form. And so what you\u2019re hearing are all these cells vibrating. And if you were to use, say a stethoscope instead of an ultrasound machine, you wouldn\u2019t hear a beat at all. But for anti-abortion rights groups, this romantic ultrasound moment that we\u2019ve all bought into, it\u2019s a way to convince the public that at six weeks of pregnancy, there\u2019s a baby with a beating heart. You could hear this strategy playing out when the Texas legislature debated the Texas heartbeat act. Here\u2019s Representative Donna Howard trying to challenge representative Shelby Slawson.Donna Howard:You\u2019re not actually hearing the sound of a heartbeat because there\u2019s not a heart beating, but you\u2019re hearing amplified version of electrical signals. Did you know that?Shelby Slawson:I fundamentally disagree with that.Donna Howard:Well, I appreciate that you don\u2019t want to believe this and that you are disagreeing with it, but I\u2019m talking about what the science says. And so you\u2019re telling me that the science is wrong because you don\u2019t agree with it.Shelby Slawson:What I\u2019m telling you is that when a beating heart represents a life within a womb, we have a duty to protect that innocent unborn life.Donna Howard:And I appreciate, excuse me, Mr. Speaker.Amy Littlefield:Whether or not you call it a heartbeat, everyone can agree that an embryo can\u2019t survive on its own at six weeks of pregnancy. And like I said earlier, under Roe V Wade, the Supreme Court ruled there\u2019s a constitutional right to abortion until the fetus is viable. But what if you just move viability from around six months to six weeks, it turns out that\u2019s what the architects of the Heartbeat Bill are trying to do.David Forte:Benjamin Franklin once said nothing is as certain as death and taxes. He left one thing out, and that is birth after a heartbeat.Amy Littlefield:That\u2019s David Forte, a former Reagan administration attorney now a law professor in Ohio who helped write Janet\u2019s original heartbeat bill. He\u2019s testifying in front of Congress.David Forte:The court also said that viability is when the fetus can survive on its own, but nobody can survive on its own. Everybody needs extrinsic help. What do doctors, obstetricians say about viability? They say a viable fetus, a viable pregnancy is one where the heart is beating and it is likely, almost inevitably to reach full term. That\u2019s what doctors say viability is, not what judges say viability is.Amy Littlefield:Mary Ziegler is a law professor and expert on abortion law. She says, Forte is playing with the semantics of the word viability, but he\u2019s also doing something else.Mary Ziegler:This is a group of people who are not entirely convinced that the Supreme Court is going to go all the way to fertilization.Amy Littlefield:In other words, a lot of anti-abortion rights activists believe life begins the moment a sperm and egg come together.Mary Ziegler:It\u2019s to say, we\u2019re going to come as close as we can to fertilization while convincing the court that they haven\u2019t done any that radical and that what they\u2019re doing is on the side of science.Amy Littlefield:We found this is part of a wider effort by anti-abortion rights groups to pivot from religious to scientific arguments. And there\u2019s a network of anti-abortion medical experts who claim that science is on their side. One of these groups is the Charlotte Lozier Institute. They used research from legitimate scientists to help promote the idea that a heartbeat means a viable pregnancy. I called up the author of a paper cited by the Institute to check it out.Jennifer Hier:I\u2019m Dr. Jennifer [Hier]. I\u2019m a full scope, practicing obstetrician gynecologist.Amy Littlefield:Dr. Hier told me that her research was conducted on people who had experienced miscarriages and were undergoing fertility treatments. She measured rates of cardiac activity to try and determine the likelihood that a pregnancy would be successful.Jennifer Hier:They want to parent children. And so are there things that we can do to make things more reassuring for them?Amy Littlefield:And yes, her study found that cardiac activity is a strong sign that a pregnancy will continue developing, but she was shocked to hear that her findings were being used to argue that people who don\u2019t want a baby should have to have one anyway.Jennifer Hier:I\u2019m embarrassed. That\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s true information, but they skew the truth. This is not a political decision, this is a medical decision and a personal decision for the person that is pregnant.Amy Littlefield:When she took to the floor of the Texas legislature, Representative Donna Howard did her best to get that point across.Donna Howard:There will always be women who will pursue having abortions despite what you do here today, and what you\u2019ve been doing for a decade to create all these obstructions. It will always be a case that women will seek abortions because women are not always in a position to have that baby. And you guys don\u2019t have to have them, we do.Amy Littlefield:As she feared, the so-called heartbeat bill was passed into law. And unlike the versions that came before it, it\u2019s taken effect.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:For five and a half months, millions of Texans have been living Janet Porter\u2019s dream. How did the courts, which once struck down the so-called heartbeat bans allow that to happen? That\u2019s next on Reveal.Al Letson:Hey, hey, hey. It\u2019s time for another Al\u2019s Podcast Pick.

You can find Radio Ambulante wherever you listen to podcasts. New episodes drop every Tuesday.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I\u2019m Ike Sriskandarajah in for Al Letson. We just heard how anti-abortion rights activists have used the claim that an embryo is a person with a beating heart as a marketing tool to advance so-called heartbeat bills. The bills ban abortion at around six weeks of pregnancy, way before what our current laws say.Under Roe V. Wade, abortion is a constitutional right up until the point that a fetus can survive outside the womb. Versions of the so-called heartbeat bill have passed into law in about a dozen states, but none of them had been allowed to take effect until Texas. And it has to do with the way the enforcement part of the law was set up. Instead of the state punishing people for performing abortions, the law was written so that any private citizen could enforce the law. And this is a pretty radical idea, but it\u2019s a big part of what has allowed the law to stand, at least for now. Reporter Amy Littlefield has been investigating how this legal strategy came about, with the help of a team of law and journalism grad students at the University of California, Berkeley. It turns out it all started in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A.Amy Littlefield:It\u2019s a gray December day in the heart of Texas and Mark Lee Dixon is on the road again in his white Ford F-150 pickup truck.Mark Lee Dixon:This morning, I left Chandler, Texas and heading to Wichita Falls, Texas.Amy Littlefield:He\u2019s talking to me on the phone while he drives. Mark has been called a traveling salesman for the anti-abortion rights movement. And while he may not have realized it at first, he\u2019s been laying the groundwork for the first so-called heartbeat law to withstand legal challenges and actually go into effect.Mark Lee Dixon:Well, right now my truck has 246,409 miles on it.Amy Littlefield:Wow. Mark grew up in east Texas. His grandfather ran a Right to Life group there and used to display models of fetuses at the county fair.Mark Lee Dixon:And I remember looking at those thinking that I was that size at one time and really had a huge impact on me.Amy Littlefield:Now Mark\u2019s running his grandfather\u2019s organization. In 2019, Mark\u2019s getting worried that an anti-abortion law in Louisiana might force the clinic where he goes to protest in Shreveport to relocate to Texas. And he\u2019s come up with a plan, he\u2019ll convince Texas cities to ban abortion by declaring themselves sanctuary cities for the unborn.Mark Lee Dixon:I was staring in this ordinance at a Chick-fil-A in Longview, Texas.Amy Littlefield:So this ordinance he\u2019s drafted would ban abortion within the city limits of Waskom, population 2000. Waskom sits just across the border from Louisiana. There\u2019s just one problem, Roe V. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion in 1973. Mark knows that these ordinances will be challenged in court and could wind up costing towns a lot of money to defend.Mark Lee Dixon:I was thinking about the unborn, but I was also thinking about the born, as well as those city council members, good people. I didn\u2019t want to see them sued into oblivion.Amy Littlefield:So he\u2019s at this Chick-fil-A trying to figure out how to outlaw abortion without bankrupting towns. And he gets in touch with Texas state Senator Brian Hughes. Hughes has received thousands of dollars in donations from anti-abortion groups over the years. His district includes Waskom.Mark Lee Dixon:And so he introduced me to a friend of his, Jonathan F. Mitchell, former Solicitor General for the State of Texas.Amy Littlefield:So they all hop on a conference call.Mark Lee Dixon:And us three looked at this together.Amy Littlefield:Jonathan is a powerful, well-connected attorney. He clerked for late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, worked in the administration of George W. Bush, and volunteered for Trump\u2019s transition team. Abortion isn\u2019t his only issue. He\u2019s fought unions, affirmative action, and same sex marriage.Mark Lee Dixon:He said he had an idea of how to allow for this Waskom ordinance to survive a legal challenge, that make it safer for the city of Waskom to pass.Amy Littlefield:This is where that strategy of private citizens enforcing abortion bans comes into play. Jonathan\u2019s idea is to write the ordinance so that the government isn\u2019t responsible for enforcing the ban. Instead, private citizens would be able to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion. So the doctor, clinic employees, even the Lyft driver who takes someone to an abortion clinic could all be sued, and citizens would be awarded at least $2,000 in damages. It almost sounds like this ordinance would be creating a corp of abortion bounty hunters.Mark Lee Dixon:What happened from there is the private enforcement was added to the ordinance. And the rest is history.Amy Littlefield:Now this is a radical idea, but also a clever one, because if you\u2019re an abortion rights group trying to challenge the abortion ban, who do you sue? If you sue the government, city officials can say, hey, we\u2019re not enforcing this ban so can\u2019t be held responsible. So then that leaves group\u2019s fighting this law playing whackamole with any private citizen who decides to sue. This novel strategy comes from another radical idea Jonathan has, something he calls the writ-of-erasure fallacy. Jonathan said he\u2019s declining all interviews because of ongoing lawsuits. But in 2018, he presents his idea at a conference of the conservative legal group, the Federalist Society.Jonathan Mitche\u2026:We have a terrific lineup, five bright, young legal scholars who will present-Amy Littlefield:Picture a baby-faced, clean shaven lawyer in his early forties. He\u2019s arguing that the court don\u2019t really have the power people think they do. And when they strike down a law, it\u2019s a fallacy to believe the law has been erased.Jonathan Mitche\u2026:Judicial review does not empower the courts to formally revoke or suspend legislation. It allows the court only to decline to enforce a statute in a case before the court and allows the court to enjoin the executive from enforcing that statute.Amy Littlefield:In other words, courts can only stop the state from enforcing a law. They can\u2019t erase the law from the books. This is a shocking idea, even to people at this conservative legal conference.Richard Epstein:Let me start with Jonathan, my former student. And Jonathan always puts the fear of God in me because, God forbid, he should be right on this particular question.Amy Littlefield:This is legal scholar, Richard Epstein, a huge rock star in conservative circles. Epstein is about to bring up a really good point. If Jonathan is right and laws struck down by the courts never really go away, then that same concept could be used to resurrect all kinds of laws. He calls them landmines.Richard Epstein:And I think most people would say that this is an enormously dangerous type situation, because what it does in effect is it kind of keeps the landmine alive. Jonathan, I think, is well aware of this particular problem.Amy Littlefield:Just think about it. If Jonathan is right and old laws don\u2019t go away, the laws that criminalized same sex relationships or required racial segregation in schools, or a slew of other laws that courts have overturned, those are all just on pause waiting for the next judge to come along and hit unpause.Richard Epstein:God forbid, anybody should ever use this.Amy Littlefield:But people in Texas are actually using this. In June 2019, a city council of five white men in Waskom, Texas approved the first sanctuary city for the unborn ordinance by a vote of five to zero. The ordinance calls Roe V. Wade illegitimate. But even more telling, it refers to abortion as murder, harkening back to old Texas laws that considered abortion a crime, laws that Jonathan argues are still on the books, just paused. More Texas cities would soon follow suit.Speaker 10:A Panola County city, Gary, declaring itself, a sanctuary city for the unborn.Amy Littlefield:Many of them are tiny communities like Gary, Texas, population around 300. None of these towns has an abortion clinic. But in fall of 2020, Mark takes his ordinance to a city that does. Lubbock, Texas is a city of just over 250,000 people. It sits several hours northwest of Dallas in a solidly red part of the state. And on the day of the hearing, in the midst of the pandemic, a lot of people turn out to testify.Speaker 21:So in the city of Lubbock, as we look at 277 lives lost to COVID, how many are you willing to see loss to abortion? Designating Lubbock as a sanctuary city would protect the tiniest and most vulnerable citizens from a certain death.Speaker 22:I\u2019m older than most people in this room, I\u2019ve never heard of such an overreaching ridiculous ordinance like this.Amy Littlefield:The city council members also don\u2019t like the ordinance. Council member Randy Christian tells the crowd that he abhors abortion, but he\u2019s been talking to legal scholars who warn the ordinance is unconstitutional.Randy Christian:Prepare for legal action to be taken against our city that well could cost the taxpayers hundreds and thousands of dollars.Amy Littlefield:Council member, Latrell Joy.Latrell Joy:I\u2019m a lawyer, licensed by the state of Texas, and I took an oath to uphold the laws of the US Constitution. I think you need to understand that we cannot do what this ordinance is proposing.Amy Littlefield:Jonathan Mitchell, who\u2019s argued cases in front of the Supreme Court has offered to represent the city pro bono if it gets sued, but it\u2019s not enough to convince the council members.Randy Christian:All those in favor of that motion, please say, aye. All those opposed to that motion, please say, aye.Speaker 25:Aye, aye.Randy Christian:Motion fails seven to zero.Amy Littlefield:But then Mark and a group of residents rally to put the ordinance on the ballot. In May of 2021, the voters in Lubbock pass it and it succeeds in shutting down abortions at the only clinic within hundreds of miles, Planned Parenthood. The strategy is working. By last summer, more than 30 cities have passed Mark\u2019s ordinance. Then he gets to Edinburg near the Mexican border.Speaker 10:All three members of Edinburg city council agreed with Mayor Molina\u2019s desire to make Edinburg the first sanctuary city for the unborn in the Rio Grande Valley.Mayor Molina:I want you to know as the mayor, and I\u2019m only one vote, we vote as a team, but you do have my commitment that you will get this done.Amy Littlefield:Texas is known for its conservative politics, but there\u2019s a robust reproductive justice movement here led by women of color and they spring into action.Zaena Zamora:Do have Zaena Zamora.Amy Littlefield:At a public hearing, Zaena Zamora is the first supporter of abortion rights to speak. She\u2019s Executive Director of Frontera Fund. The group helps people in south Texas access abortions. People often call the fund for financial or logistical help.Zaena Zamora:And over 20% of our colors were people and citizens of Edinburg.Amy Littlefield:She\u2019s a soft spoken woman and she\u2019s nervous. Her teenage son is standing behind her.Zaena Zamora:These anti-abortion ordinances and the language used to describe those seeking abortion further stigmatizes and shames people for making the best decisions for themselves and their families. The decision of whether or not to become a parent is one of the most important decisions a person can make. No matter what your view is on abortion, nobody has the right to interfere with that decision.Amy Littlefield:The turnout Zaena helped organize is beyond what she was expecting and people really bear their souls. A warning to listeners here, this next clip is about sexual violence.Speaker 29:I\u2019m not here with any group. I\u2019m here on my own. I\u2019m a resident of Edinburg. My dad raped me for the first 12 years of my life. And thank goodness, I didn\u2019t get pregnant. But if I did, I should have the choice to abort because I would not raise my brother son or my sister daughter.Speaker 30:Right now, I\u2019m here to say that my abortion saved my life.Speaker 31:Conservatives, like people here, constantly preach about government overstepping and invalidating personal freedoms. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you that is precisely what each and every one of you who are considering this ordinance are doing.Amy Littlefield:The testimony goes on for three hours. Then the city manager warns against passing the ordinance. He says he is worried about the impact it could have on the city. All of the council members back down and Richard Molina, the mayor who is gung ho about banning abortion in the city, realizes its over.Mayor Molina:If nobody makes a motion and that means that this dies, counselor?Speaker 47:That\u2019s correct. A motion is required for the city counsel to take action.Mayor Molina:Okay, so then there\u2019s no action. This item dies and we\u2019re moving on to the agenda.Speaker 47:That\u2019s correct.Mayor Molina:Okay, let\u2019s move on then.Amy Littlefield:This victory feels amazing to Zaena because it\u2019s so rare.Zaena Zamora:This is my community and my community showed up and it showed up for us, showed up for people\u2019s abortion rights.Amy Littlefield:Zaena won this battle, but she and other abortion rights supporters are losing the war. This is where Janet Porter\u2019s heartbeat bill comes back into the picture.Brian Hughes:This bill will protect the lives of our most precious Texans starting at the moment that little heart is beating.Dr. Blair Cushi\u2026:That\u2019s Brian Hughes, the Texas state Senator who brought together Jonathan Mitchell and Mark Lee Dixon during the phone call at Chick-fil-A. They\u2019re the architects of the ordinances that use citizen enforcement to ban abortions at the local level. That\u2019s given them a roadmap to do the same at the state level. So Hughes is introducing a bill that mashes up the emotional punch of Janet\u2019s heartbeat bill with the enforcement strategy of the ordinances, and he\u2019s repeating Jonathan\u2019s radical legal theory while doing it.Brian Hughes:The statutes protecting little babies from abortion that existed in 1973 are still alive and well.Amy Littlefield:Those laws criminalized abortion and Hughes is saying that they could come back.Brian Hughes:And as the Supreme Court allows us, those statutes are still very much enforceable.Amy Littlefield:The Texas six-week abortion ban known as SB 8 gets signed into law. Abortion rights groups challenge it in court. And remember, each time a so-called heartbeat bill has been challenged, it\u2019s been blocked. But Texas is overseen by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court is solidly conservative. One third of active judges were appointed by Trump. And while he doesn\u2019t argue this case at the court, Jonathan Mitchell has a great track record before the Fifth Circuit. We found 19 cases that he argued there himself and he only lost one. A few of the cases are still pending. The Fifth Circuit refuses to block SB 8 and Jonathan gets his chance to defend the law at the Supreme Court. Justice Sonya Sotomayor challenges his notion that the state is not involved in this law because it\u2019s outsourced enforcement to private citizens.Justice Sotomay\u2026:Are you suggesting that states can hire agents to do unconstitutional acts?Jonathan Mitche\u2026:No, they cannot hire agents.Justice Sotomay\u2026:So how can the state designate a private individual to act under its laws to violate a person\u2019s constitutional rights?Jonathan Mitche\u2026:There\u2019s not an agency relationship here, Justice Sotomayor.Justice Sotomay\u2026:It\u2019s saying to it, you under this law, our law, you can act.Amy Littlefield:But the court allows the law to remain in effect while legal challenges play out. In her most recent dissent, Sotomayor writes, \u201cThis case is a disaster for the rule of law and a grave disservice to women in Texas who have a right to control their own bodies.\u201d The court\u2019s decision to let the law stand for now has emboldened anti-abortion rights, activists, including heartbeat bill creator, Janet Porter. She just filed paperwork to run for Congress.Janet Porter:If a heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected. Soon the nation will follow.Amy Littlefield:So far, politicians in at least half a dozen states are trying to follow Texas\u2019s lead.Al Letson:That was journalist Amy Littlefield. Our story was produced by Katherine Mieszkowski. Law and journalism grad students from the University of California, Berkeley also helped us dig through legal cases and video archives to tell this story. The first month after the six-week abortion ban went into effect, abortions in Texas dropped by 50%, but clinics in other cities like Wichita, Kansas are being inundated with patients from Texas. That\u2019s next on Reveal.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I\u2019m Ike Sriskandarajah in for Al Letson.It\u2019s December 2021, about six months after Zaena Zamora and other activists beat back that so-called sanctuary city ordinance in Edinburg, Texas. They won the battle, but lost the war.Zaena Zamora:All right, so I just got off a call with a caller who is traveling to Wichita, Kansas from the Rio Grande Valley.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:SB 8, the heartbeat bill is state law. Zaena\u2019s organization, Frontera Fund is still helping people who need abortions, but now help more often means booking travel out of state.Zaena Zamora:Oh, that\u2019s a long flight though.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:Remember the Rio Grande Valley is at the southernmost tip of Texas. Wichita, Kansas is over 800 miles north. There\u2019s no major airport here, so patients have to take at least two flights to leave the state, and that\u2019s if they have legal status. There are interior border checkpoints on roads and at airports. Zaena says, if you\u2019re undocumented, travel is difficult, if not impossible.Zaena Zamora:Man, the flights are expensive.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:And then there\u2019s the cost.Zaena Zamora:And this trip is going to cost us $770.21. So now I have to look for hotels.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:Another $220. All in all, it takes Zaena 25 minutes and about a thousand dollars to book a flight and a hotel for one person.Speaker 39:And folks from the flight deck. Welcome to 4367 to Wichita.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:There are thousands of people who are looking for help. To really understand how this Texas law is affecting abortion access, we had to leave Texas. So we sent Reveal producer Nadia Hamdan to a clinic in Wichita.Nadia Hamdan:So what are we doing here today?Dr. Christina B\u2026:Today is a busy, busy clinic day, pre-holiday, which can be hit or miss in terms of busy. And we are on an absolute hit day.Nadia Hamdan:The Trust Women Clinic in Wichita, Kansas used to see maybe one or two Texas patients a month. Now, it\u2019s more like two dozen. And today, Dr. Christina Bourne is the only doctor available to see them.Dr. Christina B\u2026:I feel like we see a lot of folks who\u2019ve been driving all night, who have slept in their cars, things like that.Nadia Hamdan:Over the next 10 hours, she\u2019ll see 30 patients.Dr. Christina B\u2026:We\u2019re seeing a lot more later cases because folks have to travel more, process the fact that they likely can\u2019t get care in their own state.Nadia Hamdan:The fact that people in Texas are flocking to Kansas for abortion care is kind of remarkable. Yes, Kansas allows an abortion up to 22 weeks, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s some liberal bastion. In fact, this clinic was infamous.Speaker 42:The confessed killer of an abortion doctor in Kansas defended his actions today at his sentencing.Nadia Hamdan:It was Dr. George Tiller\u2019s clinic. He was a well known abortion rights advocate and one of the only doctors in the country to perform abortions after 25 weeks, until he was murdered in 2009, when an anti-abortion activist shot him one Sunday morning at church.Speaker 42:He said the killing was justified to save the lives of unborn children.Nadia Hamdan:Today though, this once infamous clinic has become an unexpected refuge.Dr. Christina B\u2026:Great. That\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll take a look at it real quick.Nadia Hamdan:It\u2019s not long before Dr. Bourne gets pulled away into an exam room. It\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll get a chance to speak to her for the rest of the day. So I step out into the main room where clinic director, Ashley Brink is managing the flow of patients. She\u2019s wearing a mask that says, abortion is normal. A t-shirt that says abortion is essential healthcare.Ashley Brink:So I mean, it\u2019s the epitome of autonomy. If we can\u2019t control our future, our reproductive health, then we\u2019ve lost. So we\u2019re just trying to keep it together and hold it together here.Nadia Hamdan:I\u2019m sure you can hear the pop music playing in the background. It\u2019s clear the staff is doing their best to keep people\u2019s spirits up.Ashley Brink:We are one org, but there\u2019s orgs all over the country who are kind of also holding up the abortion sky right now and we\u2019re just a piece of that pie.Nadia Hamdan:Trust Women has added six more doctors into its rotations since September to keep up with demand. That\u2019s a total of 17 doctors and they\u2019re traveling here from all over the country. They\u2019re coming from places like California, Florida, and yes, Texas. Not a single one lives in Kansas. Clinic staff tell me, doctors here have dealt with a lot of harassment. It\u2019s easier to recruit doctors who come and go.Ashley Brink:And so this is kind of their secondary job, I guess. So they travel when they can and that\u2019s when we set up their schedule is when they have availability.Nadia Hamdan:A surgical abortion usually takes about three to five minutes, but even so patients are often told they\u2019ll be waiting for six to eight hours. The clinic\u2019s normally open until five, but they\u2019ve been closing later and later.Speaker 44:Don\u2019t leave here until 8:30 on Friday.Nadia Hamdan:And the late nights are just one thing the staff have had to get used to. There\u2019s also the gauntlet of protestors outside, the parked truck with a giant picture of a decapitated fetus, the Manila envelope at the front desk with bomb threat instructions. Another example, in Kansas, the person counseling a patient about their decision to have an abortion can\u2019t be the doctor performing the procedure.Alexandria Paaz:This is the room. Patients sit here. I sit here. Here\u2019s my certificate.Nadia Hamdan:Clinic staffer Alexandria Paaz shows me the special room for this required counseling. I can see a bunch of these certificates covering part of the wall. And can you describe what this is, the credentials of ministry?Alexandria Paaz:Pastoral. We have to be certified like an ordained, I guess, minister.Nadia Hamdan:Yes, a minister. Now Alex and other staff could have gotten licensed in psychology or social work, but that\u2019s expensive and time consuming. The shortest path to becoming a legal counselor is to enter the clergy. So half a dozen Trust Women staffers got themselves ordained.Alexandria Paaz:Yeah. This board is starting to fill up. Both boards are starting to fill up.Nadia Hamdan:By noon, the clinic\u2019s big white board is filling up with surgical procedures. Another board is filling up with medication abortions. Those are the patients who are earlier in their pregnancies and aren\u2019t having surgery. Instead, they\u2019ll take some pills. I noticed one patient opens her exam room door to ask how much longer she needs to wait. Another patient begins to moan as a nurse struggles to find a vein for her IV. Another is rolled out from the operating room, still drowsy from the pain meds. And new patients keep arriving. Clinic director, Ashley Brink makes sure to check in on them. AreAshley Brink:Are you still doing okay in there, sweetie? Yeah. Doctor\u2019s finishing up a procedure. She\u2019ll be right in, okay. Do you need anything?Nadia Hamdan:The clinic asked everyone if they wanted to share their experience with a reporter, me, during their visit. It\u2019s not really surprising that no one agrees. But I\u2019m standing next to Ashley when I overhear that one of the patients being prepped is from Southeast Texas.Ashley Brink:So did I see that the woman that was sitting here-Nadia Hamdan:She was from Texas.Ashley Brink:Yes.So she actually came in on Friday a little bit later in the day and based on her gestational age, we were unable to see her that same day.Nadia Hamdan:Gestational age just means how far along someone is in their pregnancy. This patient is 16 weeks, early in her second trimester.Ashley Brink:We\u2019ve seen some higher gestations because people are waiting, have to wait three weeks, a month to get an appointment.Nadia Hamdan:The higher gestational age means this patient now needs a different kind of surgical procedure. And while the procedure itself only takes 10 to 15 minutes, it\u2019s going to take a lot longer to prep her body.Ashley Brink:[crosstalk] weekend, so we were able to get her a hotel. And so she came in and she\u2019ll get her abortion today, and then she\u2019ll go back to Texas.Nadia Hamdan:I don\u2019t know this patient\u2019s story, but I do know that anyone from Texas sitting in this clinic has had to navigate both Texas and Kansas abortion laws. That means an ultrasound, a counseling session, a mandatory 24-hour waiting period, a second appointment with the same doctor, potentially another ultrasound, four to 13 hours of travel, another ultrasound, another counseling session, another six to eight hours of waiting and up to $2,400, sometimes more just for the procedure. And that\u2019s for someone who is able to get an abortion here. A lot of people won\u2019t. The staff at Trust Women told me that about a quarter of patients never show up for their appointments.Ashley Brink:We\u2019re doing the best we can to help as many people as possible. But I think the hardest is that we know that we can\u2019t help or save everybody. And so it\u2019s hard.Nadia Hamdan:As I listen to her, Ashley\u2019s mask and t-shirts stare back at me. Abortion is normal. Abortion is essential healthcare. How do you respond to the opposition that tend to say the minute there\u2019s cardiac activity, according to you, for them a heartbeat, they\u2019re saying, that means now I\u2019m caring for two patients instead of one.Ashley Brink:You can believe what you want to believe. But at the end of the day, again, the only thing that matters to me is that the person in front of me is getting the care that they want, that they need, and that they deserve in a respectful non-judgmental way.Nadia Hamdan:Ashley says her staff will keep showing up, keep playing music, keep holding up that sky for as long as they can.Ike Sriskandara\u2026:That was Reveal\u2019s Nadia Hamdan. Right now, the Supreme Court is debating the fate of Roe V. Wade. Clinic staff in Wichita are all but sure it will be overturned.
