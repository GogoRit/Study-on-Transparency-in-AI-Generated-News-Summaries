Wade.\u00a0\nAccording to new CU Boulder research\u00a0based on newly available data from 2020, such a ban would increase maternal mortality\u00a0by 24%, a 14% increase from the previous data from 2017.\nIn this study, researchers focused only on how maternal mortality is impacted by abortion simply because data shows staying pregnant carries a higher risk of death than having an abortion. The Centers for Disease Control reported 0.41 deaths per 100,000 legal abortions between 2013\u201318\u00a0and that the maternal mortality rate was 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.\nOther factors, like how society will facilitate access to abortion for those living in states where it\u2019s illegal or how criminalization will impact health care seeking, were not factored in.\u00a0\n\u201cThe prior estimates relied on abortion rates, births\u00a0and maternal mortality rates as of five years ago. Since then, abortions have increased, births have decreased and maternal mortality rates have worsened,\u201d said Amanda Stevenson, an assistant professor of sociology at CU Boulder and lead author of the paper.\nStevenson and coauthors Leslie Root and Jane Menken\u2014all researchers in the Institute of Behavioral Science\u2014estimate that\u00a0in the first year following a nationwide abortion ban, the number of maternal deaths would increase from a baseline of 861 to 969 (a 13% increase). In subsequent years, maternal deaths would increase 210 over baseline, a 24% increase.\u00a0\n\n \n Click to enlarge\n\tChart comparing maternal mortality in states where abortion is or will become illegal\n\nFor Black people, the numbers are even more alarming: The expected increase in maternal deaths if abortion were to be banned in every state\u00a0jumped 18% to 39%.\n\u201cThere is a robust network of Black-led research demonstrating how we can better support Black pregnant people who are at 2-3 times greater risk of dying because they\u2019re pregnant compared to other groups,\u201d Stevenson said.\u00a0\nWhen looking specifically at the 26 states that have already banned or plan to ban abortion following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, researchers found a lot of variation. In states with already high maternal mortality and moderate to high abortion rates\u2014like Florida and Georgia\u2014researchers estimate maternal deaths to increase by 29%.\u00a0\nIn contrast, states like Nebraska, Missouri and West Virginia which have already made it difficult to get an abortion are expected to see little to no change just due to the increased risks of staying pregnant.\u00a0\nResearchers estimate that\u00a0if no abortions were permitted in these 26 states in 2020\u00a0there would have been 64 more mortality-related deaths. The new findings have not yet been peer reviewed.\nTo combat this alarming trend, the researchers say helping people in states where abortion is illegal obtain legal access to reproductive care, investing in the maternal health crisis and addressing the shocking inequalities that generate astronomically high levels of maternal mortality are all ways to better support pregnant people in the U.S.\n\u201cOur estimates highlight how we can prevent the post-Dobbs bans on abortion from increasing the already tragically high numbers of deaths due to pregnancy in the U.S.,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cPregnancy shouldn\u2019t kill people\u2014in fact in other rich countries it very rarely does.\u201d\nCategories:Health & Society\nNews Headlines\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n \nSecrets from the grave\n\nBy studying human skeletal remains, bioarchaeologist Sharon DeWitte is opening a new window into past pandemics and giving voice to the voiceless.
