Some have criticised the award, saying that Wiewi\u00f3rka violated the girl\u2019s privacy and harassed her online.\nOn Friday, during a press conference broadcast with the title \u201cStop hate against defenders of life\u201d, the ministry presented Wiewi\u00f3rka with a medal for \u201cmerit in the field of justice\u201d, reports Tok FM.\nDeputy justice minister Marcin Romanowski hailed her for her \u201cloud cry of protest when it was easiest to remain silent, for fighting for human life and compliance with the law, for courage, determination and not showing indifference\u201d.\nRomanowski added that the ministry always supports the defence of human life and highly values the actions of all NGOs that are actively involved in pro-life campaigning. Poland\u2019s abortion law, which is the strictest in the EU apart from Malta\u2019s, does not allow for elective abortion. The conservative government has expressed support for tightening it further.\nWiewi\u00f3rka is a 25-year-old volunteer at Fundacja Pro-Prawo do \u017bycia, an NGO known for organising demonstrations with posters of aborted foetuses as well as seeking to criminalise sex education and driving loudspeaker vans through Polish cities broadcasting messages linking LGBT people to paedophilia.\n\nPolish court rules campaign linking LGBT and paedophilia is \u201cinformative and educational\u201d\n\nWiewi\u00f3rka said that she was accepting the award \u201cnot just in my own name, but in the name of all pro-life activists, who every day demonstrate the value of human life, who take it to the streets to say out loud that abortion is murder\u201d, despite \u201cfacing aggression and violence\u201d from their opponents.\n\u201cIn recent days, my family and I have fallen victim to a massive attack by pro-abortion groups\u2026that promote illegal abortion, which aim to intimidate me and force me to abandon the struggle for the life of the unborn,\u201d added Wiewi\u00f3rka, saying that this has included threats against her and the publication of personal information.\nHowever, critics of Wiewi\u00f3rka \u2013 and of the justice ministry\u2019s decision to honour her \u2013 argue that it is she who is responsible for harassment, due to the manner in which she prevented a 17-year-old girl from having an abortion.\nIt began when, in a closed Facebook group for people seeking abortion advice, the girl wrote that she was considering terminating an unwanted pregnancy. She then started to receive a string of messages from Wiewi\u00f3rka, including images of aborted foetuses. The teenager has shared screenshots of the message and complained that she was harassed, reports Interia.\nWith the girl refusing to change her mind, Wiewi\u00f3rka then contacted her boyfriend and parents, who were unaware of the pregnancy, reports Wysokie Obcasy.\n\u201cIt turned out that [the boyfriend] did not even know that he was the father,\u201d wrote Wiewi\u00f3rka. \u201cHe and the girl\u2019s parents stood up to the task and managed to prevent the killing of this unborn child, for which I thank God and this young girl\u2026[who] has avoided a huge mistake that [she] could have regretted her whole life.\u201d\nWhile Fundacja Pro-Prawo do \u017bycia celebrated the effective intervention, Krystyna Kacpura, head of the Federation for Women and Family Planning, condemned the invasion of the girl\u2019s privacy. She said that pro-life activists have infiltrated many abortion-related forums and often attempt such interventions.\n\u201cWe demand the cessation of intimidation and surveillance of women who are looking for information about abortion in online forums,\u201d said Kacpura, quoted by Wysokie Obcasy.\u00a0\u201cThe provision of information is legal in our country. But is it really legal to interfere in someone else\u2019s life so deeply?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbortion Without Borders\u201d initiative to help Polish women obtain terminations abroad\n\nAnother pro-choice organisation, the Abortion Dream Team, called the intervention a form of \u201ctorture\u201d, and condemned groups that \u201cspread hatred, lies and manipulation\u201d about abortion.\nA women\u2019s right group, Og\u00f3lnopolski Strajk Kobiet, posted a screenshot appearing to show that Wiewi\u00f3rka has endorsed blowing up buildings where abortions take place, and raised the idea of murdering those who carry out abortions, because it would save the lives of unborn children, reports Wprost.\nThe issue of abortion returned to the centre of public debate last month, when legislation that would outlaw almost all legally conducted terminations in Poland returned to the parliamentary agenda. The bill, which is a citizen\u2019s initiative, was voted through to the next stage of the legislative process by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, with most opposition parties voting against it.\nOpinion polls show that only a small minority in Poland favour tightening the abortion law, with a larger group wanting it to be liberalised. Most, however, appear to favour sticking with the current \u201ccompromise\u201d, introduced in 1993, that allows abortion only in cases of a threat to the life or health of the mother, if the pregnancy results from a criminal act, or if the foetus is diagnosed with a birth defect.\n\nAs abortion ban returns to parliament, Polish women find ways to protest amid lockdown\n\nMain image credit: Ministerstwo Sprawiedliwo\u015bci/Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgnieszka W\u0105do\u0142owskaAgnieszka W\u0105do\u0142owska is deputy editor of Notes from Poland.
