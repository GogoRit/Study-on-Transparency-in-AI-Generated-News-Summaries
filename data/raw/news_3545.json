Wade, the chair of the U.S. Catholic bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities is encouraging his fellow bishops to practice radical solidarity with pregnant women and the unborn \u2014 and to remember, in the words of St. Teresa of Calcutta, that \u201cwe belong to one another.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot pretend to understand what women in all such circumstances are going through,\u201d Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore said Tuesday of pregnant women who are struggling. \u201cBut this much we do know: They are our sisters. We are their brothers. They are our neighbors, and we are their neighbors. Their distress is our distress, their struggle is our struggle.\u201d\nLori made his remarks while addressing the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 fall general assembly in Baltimore just hours after\u00a0he was elected its new vice president.\nHis comments\u00a0echoed his past statements following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization to overturn Roe v. Wade in a ruling that frees individual states to decide abortion policy. Since then, Lori has\u00a0expressed support for a proposed national 15-week abortion ban\u00a0and has\u00a0written to members of Congress, along with other bishops, about building a life-affirming society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAbortion is a gruesome sign that we have forgotten that we belong to one another,\u201d Lori said Tuesday. \u201cAbortion destroys innocent human life, and it also weakens the fabric of society.\u201d\nHe went on to share 10 points on building a culture of life from within the Church.\nCalling the post-Roe age a \u201cpivotal moment in our culture,\u201d Lori first advised his brother bishops \u201cto take stock.\u201d Some Catholics today, he cautioned, are still \u201con the fence\u201d when it comes to abortion.\n\u201cThe demise of Roe was a great victory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will be a pyrrhic victory if we fail to win the minds and hearts first and foremost of our fellow Catholics.\u201d\nFor his second point, he highlighted that the bishops cannot win hearts and minds by changing Church teaching. Instead, they must lay open its heart and soul \u2014 speaking truthfully and with compassion.\nLori said, next, that for the Catholic bishops to speak credibly in a polarized society, they must eliminate division from within and acknowledge that the Church\u2019s various causes are connected to one another rather than competing in a \u201czero-sum game.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth, he emphasized the importance of initiatives like the bishops\u2019 pro-life parish-based ministry\u00a0Walking with Moms in Need\u00a0that help unify various ministries while supporting both a mission of service and evangelization.\nHe also called for active participation in building a world where women are esteemed, children are loved and protected, and men are called to fulfill their responsibilities as husbands and fathers.\nFor his sixth point, Lori stressed that radical solidarity is key in the public square. And, for his seventh, he said that the bishops\u2019 message and witness to the culture must be that they are making the good of others their own \u2014 especially in a fragmented world of angry partisanship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another recommendation, he advised that building a culture of life demands speaking forthrightly and bearing witness to the beauty of love and the dignity of every human life.\u00a0\nThe truth must be spoken in love both boldly and clearly, he said next, especially in the face of false and misleading information.\u00a0\nFor his last point, he recognized that the reaction to the overturning of Roe signals that the bishops face a long and difficult struggle ahead.\u00a0\n\u201cThe state referenda held since Dobbs illustrate that,\u201d he said, referring to\u00a0ballot initiatives to protect and expand abortion that passed across the nation\u00a0on Election Day.\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Miracles\u2019: Rhode Island Catholic school thrives after last-ditch purchase from diocese\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\nHe ended by asking for the Holy Spirit\u2019s intercession so that the bishops might speak with one voice and one heart.\n\u201cWe\u2019re striving to create a society in which abortion and other attacks on innocent human life become more and more unthinkable. Unthinkable because our radical solidarity gives many new hope and because our radical witness makes clearer that killing can never be the solution to our social challenges,\u201d Lori urged.\n\u201cThis is the message we need clearly to send when we meet with politicians and public officials of every persuasion.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also the message, he said, that the bishops need to send while leading Catholics in state marches for life as well as the national March for Life.\u00a0\n\u201cWe come not as angry demonstrators with narrow, partisan interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe come rather to bear witness to the beauty of love and life, the preciousness and the inviolable dignity of every human life.\u201d\nHe encouraged participation in the national March for Life, held every year around the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe v. Wade in Washington, D.C., to galvanize efforts to protect the unborn at the federal and state levels.\n\u201cBut even as we seek to win minds and hearts to the cause of life,\u201d he concluded, \u201cso we must continue to strive to win legal protection for the most vulnerable among us, confident that winning for them does not mean losing for others.\u201d\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:\nCatholic News, \nPro-life advocacy, \nArchbishop William Lori, \nUSCCB Fall General Assembly 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
