(AP) \u2014 Democrat Russet Perry has knocked on thousands of doors in a swing district outside the nation\u2019s capital as she campaigns for a seat that could decide control of the Virginia state Senate in November. The issue that comes up the most \u2014 particularly among women and even from some Republicans and independents, she says \u2014 is protecting abortion rights. The topic has motivated voters and upended traditional political wisdom in election after election since a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to the procedure last year. But it may be especially front of mind in Virginia, the only state in the South that has not imposed new abortion restrictions since Roe v. Wade fell. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin \u2014 whose push to ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy was blocked by the Democratic-controlled Senate \u2014 has pledged to try again if the GOP wins full control in the state.\n\n\u201cI see this fight and this race as being pivotal to what happens to many, many, many people, not just here, but across the entire South,\u201d said Perry, a former prosecutor and ex-CIA officer who noted that women from throughout the region have sought abortions in Virginia since Roe was overturned. \n\n\n\n\n\n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidate in high-stakes Virginia election performed sex acts with husband in live videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those on either side of the debate, Virginia \u2014 where all state House and Senate seats are up for election and early voting begins Friday \u2014 is among the biggest fights this year over abortion rights. The Commonwealth\u2019s odd-year elections are often an indicator of the national mood heading into major election years and offer both parties a chance to test campaign strategies, messaging and policy ahead of 2024 contests for president, Congress and other offices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats are banking on abortion rights to be a winning issue, just as it was in the 2022 midterms and in earlier contests this year in Virginia and elsewhere. They hope it will lift candidates in a place that Democrat Joe Biden won in 2020 but where voters a year later backed Youngkin, who is still mentioned as a possible late 2024 entry for president. \n\nThe Democratic National Committee recently invested $1.2 million into Virginia races, and Vice President Kamala Harris was in the state Thursday to kick off a college tour aimed at mobilizing young voters to fight for reproductive rights, action on climate change and other issues.Republicans are centering their focus elsewhere in an echo of Youngkin\u2019s winning 2021 campaign \u2014 when the businessman defeated a former governor at a time when Roe was still law. They\u2019re talking about kitchen table issues, such as the cost of living, public safety and protecting the role of parents in directing their children\u2019s education. Zack Roday, the coordinated campaign director at Youngkin\u2019s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said Democrats are focused on abortion because they \u201chave nothing to run on.\u201d He accused Democrats of misrepresenting Youngkin\u2019s proposed 15-week limit on abortions as a total ban. Most abortions take place before 15 weeks, and Youngkin\u2019s proposal includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. \n\n\u201cThey have no vision, no agenda, nothing to offer the Commonwealth,\u201d Roday said. \u201cIt\u2019s all fear and lies.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n                    RELATED COVERAGE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Virginia Democrats say livestreamed sex acts a distraction from election\u2019s real stakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading abortion opponents also see Virginia as a place where Republicans can reframe the discussion and avoid the \u201costrich strategy\u201d of trying to evade the issue. They have pushed GOP candidates to explain their personal positions, to speak compassionately about both unborn children and the women who may seek abortions, and to push policies such as improving the foster care and adoption systems.The country\u2019s most prominent anti-abortion group hired Kellyanne Conway, a GOP pollster who was President Donald Trump\u2019s senior counselor, to advise candidates in Virginia and elsewhere on their handling of the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just say, well, I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d said Kaitlin Makuski, political director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. She pushed back on Democratic criticism of Youngkin and other Republicans as \u201cextreme\u201d on abortion, saying the 15-week ban was \u201ccommon-sense legislation.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights advocates say they are seeing voter support grow as more states impose restrictions and the reality of life without Roe becomes clearer. \u201cThere\u2019s basically a never-ending drip of horror stories from the states on abortion bans,\u201d said Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, citing stories about women denied care and young rape victims forced to carry pregnancies to term. She also dismissed anti-abortion activists\u2019 attempts to shift their messaging. \u201cThat\u2019s their new thing. They want to be \u2018compassionate.\u2019 It\u2019s garbage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wild to me that they think anyone will buy that they are compassionate on this issue at all, or that they really, truly believe a 15-week ban is perceived as a compassionate compromise.\u201d\n\nPolling shows people\u2019s opinions on abortion in the U.S. are complex, though most want the procedure to be legal, at least in the initial stages of pregnancy. An Associated Press/NORC poll conducted in June found about two-thirds of Americans said abortion should generally be legal.About half of Americans said abortions should be permitted at the 15-week mark, the poll found. By 24 weeks of pregnancy, about two-thirds of Americans said it should be barred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    MORE VIRGINIA COVERAGE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoungkin signs bipartisan budget that boosts tax relief and school funding in Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Williams becomes 1st Democrat to enter West Virginia governor\u2019s race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia lawsuit stemming from police pepper-spraying an Army officer will be settled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2021, Youngkin generally sought to avoid discussing abortion in detail and was secretly recorded acknowledging that \u201cas a campaign topic\u201d the issue wouldn\u2019t help him win the needed support of independent voters.Virginia law allows abortion during the first and second trimesters. The procedure may be performed during the third trimester only if multiple physicians certify that continuing the pregnancy is likely to \u201csubstantially and irremediably\u201d impair the mental or physical health of the woman or result in her death.Virginia Democrats point to two in-state elections since the fall of Roe as showing the potency of the issue. One is the victory of Democratic Sen. Aaron Rouse in a January special election. Rouse flipped a previously red seat after campaigning heavily on protecting abortion access. The other is the resounding defeat of incumbent Sen. Joe Morrissey, a scandal-plagued, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Democrat, by his June primary challenger, Lashrecse Aird, who centered her campaign around abortion rights. Nationally, Democrats are buoyed by the outcome in a half dozen states, including conservative Kentucky and Kansas, where voters opted to protect reproductive rights on abortion-related ballot measures. In August, Ohio voters rejected a measure pushed by Republicans that was seen as a proxy for an abortion rights question on the ballot this fall. Perry used her first TV ad to both introduce herself and hit Republican opponent Juan Pablo Segura on the issue of abortion.Segura, the founder of a maternal health care startup, has said he supports Youngkin\u2019s proposal to ban abortions after 15 weeks. Most abortions in Virginia take place before then, according to federal data. Segura\u2019s campaign did not make him available for an interview.In a statement, Segura criticized Perry, saying she has a \u201cweak record\u201d as a prosecutor battling crime and in addressing the \u201cskyrocketing cost of living\u201d \u2014 issues he said he\u2019s hearing about from voters \u201cconstantly.\u201d \u201cVoters are making it very clear that this election is about much more than one issue,\u201d he said.
