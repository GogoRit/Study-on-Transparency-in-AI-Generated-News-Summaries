Henry McMaster has said he intends to sign the Fetal Heartbeat Bill into law as soon as the state's General Assembly passes it.(Live 5/File)By Adam MintzerUpdated: Feb. 17, 2021 at 10:43 AM ESTShare on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInCOLUMBIA, S.C. (WCSC) - The South Carolina General Assembly is expected to pass the state\u2019s Fetal Heartbeat Bill.The final vote could come Wednesday afternoon, which would then send the bill to Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s desk.Here\u2019s a look at the bill as it now stands:The bill would ban most abortions in South Carolina because abortions would not be allowed once a fetal heartbeat is detected. That usually happens around six to eight weeks after conception.Doctors or healthcare providers who perform an abortion in violation of the law could face a felony charge with a $10,000 fine, two years in jail or both.Abortion would still be allowed in the following instances:RapeIncestFetal anomalyCarrying the baby would harm the mother\u2019s life.Doctors must give the sheriff the patient\u2019s contact info within 24 hours if an abortion is performed on a woman who was pregnant as a result of rape or incest.You can find contact information for your lawmakers here.All of the lawmakers who represent you in state government are accessible and want to hear from their constituents.The bill is expected to pass as early as Wednesday and will go to the governor\u2019s desk. McMaster has indicated he will sign the bill into law.But pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union are expected to immediately file a lawsuit claiming the law is unconstitutional.It is expected that any litigation surrounding the law would prevent it from immediately taking effect.Some Republican lawmakers hope the bill will be used to challenge Roe v. Wade in the U.S. Supreme Court.Democrats and some legal experts say that is unlikely, however, since other states have already passed similar laws that are waiting to be taken up by the high court.Copyright 2021 WCSC.
