Greg Abbott on Sunday, advised health care providers to postpone \u201csurgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary.\u201d Whether or not a procedure is necessary, it states, should be \u201cdetermined by the patient\u2019s physician.\u201d The restriction on nonessential medical procedures was designed to free up personal protective equipment \u2014 like N95 respirators \u2014 for medical staff on the front lines of the Covid-19 epidemic. The bulk of the order was directed at loosening hospital regulations to increase capacity.\nThe restriction on nonessential medical procedures mimicked guidance released by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Neither that guidance nor Abbott\u2019s order specifies a list of banned procedures.\nNonetheless, on Monday, Paxton posted a warning that Abbott\u2019s order meant that \u201cany type of abortion\u201d would be banned except those necessary to save a woman\u2019s life. Anyone who violated the order, he wrote, \u201cwill be met with the full force of the law\u201d \u2014 including possible criminal prosecution and jail time.\nIn response, the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood, and the Lawyering Project filed an emergency federal civil rights suit on behalf of Texas\u2019s abortion providers, arguing that the state has no right to ban abortion even amid the epidemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Join Our Newsletter        \n\n          Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.        \n\n          I'm in\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Paxton\u2019s interpretation, the order would deprive \u201cpatients of the freedom to make a very personal decision in consultation with their medical providers, which is all the more weighty given the increased health risks to pregnant persons during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d it reads.\nSince the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak, abortion providers have taken precautions to \u201cmaximize the safety of their patients and staff and to conserve PPE,\u201d the lawsuit states. Abortion does not generally require numerous medical staff or copious use of PPE, and rarely N95 respirators, which are so valuable for professionals providing front-line care. Medication abortion \u2014 a protocol of two pharmaceuticals taken in the earliest weeks of pregnancy \u2014 requires no PPE but would also be banned under Paxton\u2019s interpretation.\nThe providers note that prior to Abbott\u2019s order \u2014 and Paxton\u2019s threats \u2014 medical professionals, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, released a statement advising that abortion is essential health care. \u201cThe consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person\u2019s life, health, and well-being.\u201d\nThe lawsuit argues that Paxton\u2019s \u201cthreats are a blatant effort to exploit a public health crisis to advance an extreme, anti-abortion agenda, without any benefit to the state in terms of preventing or resolving shortages of PPE or hospital capacity.\u201d\nAs a result, providers have already had to turn away clients, and with no end to the epidemic in sight, unless blanket enforcement of the order is blocked, patients seeking care may have to wait months and some may be forced into childbearing. \u201cNot only will these patients be deprived of their constitutional right to essential health care and self-determination, but forcing them to continue their pregnancies will in fact impose far greater strains on an already-taxed health care system, as prenatal care and delivery involve much greater exhaustion of hospital health care services and PPE than abortions,\u201d reads the lawsuit.\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic and its fallout do not reduce patients\u2019 needs for abortion,\u201d the providers argue. \u201cIf anything, they make timely access to abortion even more urgent, while raising additional obstacles for patients seeking that care.\u201d\n \n\n\n \n\n\n            Read Our Complete Coverage          \nThe Coronavirus Crisis\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Texas has already erected a raft of barriers to access; laws passed in 2013 shuttered half the state\u2019s abortion facilities. The state requires patients to jump through a series of medically unnecessary hoops to receive care. Lawmakers have gone so far as to suggest that abortion be reclassified as murder and that both abortion doctors and the patients they serve be eligible for the death penalty.\nAnti-abortion politicians in Ohio have also tried to crackdown on abortion care amid the epidemic, and according to Rewire.News, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser \u2014 an ally of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2014 penned a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar suggesting ways that the federal government could further block abortion access.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that the Texas attorney general is exploiting this pandemic to end abortion in the state,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cAbortion care is time-sensitive and essential health care that has a profound impact on a person\u2019s health and life, which is why it is protected as a constitutional right. Texas is abusing the state\u2019s emergency powers and we are filing suit \u2026 to stop it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    Contact the author:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jordan Smith          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      jordan.smith@theintercept.com                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                      @chronic_jordan                                      \non X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        Anti-Abortion Politicians Are Exploiting the Coronavirus Outbreak to Shutter Health Clinics      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n        When It Comes to Coronavirus and Pregnancy, \u201cWe Just Don\u2019t Know a Whole Lot Yet\u201d      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Latest Stories  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Series          \n\n\nKen Klippenstein\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nCARCOSA is an AI-driven program that aims to reduce information overload for soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Voices            \n\n            Let\u2019s Name It: Not Just Islamophobia, but Anti-Palestinianism          \n\n\nHani Sabra\n- Mar. 18\n\n\nFrom Joe Biden on down, liberals denounce anti-Muslim bias to avoid mentioning the scourge of hate against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n            A Real Social Security Office Gave Me a Flyer With a Scam Phone Number On It          \n\n\nShawn Musgrave\n- Mar. 17\n\n\nScammers have infiltrated a Social Security Administration building in New York, imperiling your personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Join The Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t            Join Our Newsletter          \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              Original reporting.
