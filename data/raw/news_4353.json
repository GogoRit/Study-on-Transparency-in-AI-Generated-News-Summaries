Ms. Mahendru felt \u201cdecades of anxieties and hesitancy reduced to five minutes of brisk interaction with her provider,\u201d and left convinced that the \u201crealm of women\u2019s health was just not for her.\u201d According to Nikki, a Duke University undergraduate, her mother\u2019s \u201ctrust in the system was lost.\u201d\u00a0\nMahendru joined Dr. Megan Huchko, the director of the Duke Center for Global Reproductive Health, and Dr. Chemtai Mungo, a Fogarty Global Health Fellow and OB-GYN doctor, on the Center for Global Women\u2019s Health Technologies\u2019 October 20 panel \u201cImpact of Race and Socioeconomic Status in Women\u2019s Health and Gynecology.\u201d The panel was moderated by Ashley Deans and Alexandria Da Ponte.\nMahendru went on to detail an experience she had in the clinic with Carmen, a patient who spoke only Spanish and was also new to the gynecologist. The medical translator and Mahendru learned her story: she had been in pain for a year but had kept quiet due to money problems, had worked most of her life to send her kids to college, and was learning English via Rosetta Stone. With the details of Carmen\u2019s story and an \u201cequitable working relationship,\u201d Mahendru and the translator could relay Carmen\u2019s previous history to her provider. But Carmen\u2019s provider knew only of her condition.\u00a0\nMahendru thinks gynecology done right has the potential to help women love their bodies and take care of their health, but gynecologists must earn the trust of their patients: \u201cActs of listening help bridge disparities.\u201d\nDr. Huchko stated that throughout history, a male-dominated healthcare landscape saw the depiction of menses as \u2018dirty,\u2019 terms like \u2018hysteria,\u2019 and an overall lack of female control. The \u201cfather of gynecology\u201d James Marion Sims exploited Black women in his development of the field, using unanesthetized slaves as subjects of experimentation. In general, Dr. Huchko sees a trend: \u201cThe lessening or decentering of women in women\u2019s health corresponds to more discrimination.\u201d In addition to the decentering of women, Dr. Huchko said that structural and individual factors \u201cproduce outcomes that prevent women from getting the care they need.\u201d Like Mahendru, she identified trust as a central issue.\nDr. Huchko cited an experience in which she bore witness to the unattended consequences of racial bias in medicine. In Niger to repair women\u2019s fistulas, which occur due to lack of postpartum care, Dr. Huchko felt she was attending to the downstream symptom of a much broader issue. She felt uncomfortable when the urogynecologist on her team ignorantly praised Sims without acknowledging his problematic history. Then, she saw this ignorance firsthand.\u00a0\nMaking a false assumption about the nature of the case, Dr. Huchko\u2019s team chose to operate on a woman with a mass in her bladder. During the surgery, they realized the mass was a malignant tumor. With an unbiased eye and a complete exam and workup, this would have been clear. But because the team was looking at these women as \u201cone-dimensional,\u201d a woman with stage 4 cancer was subjected to a very invasive surgery that worsened her quality of life.\u00a0\nDr. Huchko experienced a similar lack of structural competency during her residency, where colleagues openly racially profiled people and overtly discussed disparities in pain tolerances among different ethnicities. Since then, \u201cthings have changed,\u201d and she embraces this new culture of \u201cbeing patient centered, exploring our own biases, and [having] zero tolerance for racial profiling.\u201d She stresses the need for personal education and accountability alongside systemic change. Eventually, this will lead to women feeling \u201crespected, seen, and heard.\u201d\nComing to the US from Kenya, Dr. Mungo quickly came to appreciate the \u201csheer magnitude\u201d of structural racism and its impact on health and healthcare. Dr. Mungo explained that \u201cmutually reinforcing systems of disadvantage\u201d for people of color, such as food deserts, are both the result and cause of healthcare disparities and result in enduring legacies of disadvantage.\nDr. Mungo also observed that with healthcare in the US being so economically driven, the best care is often directed at those with racial and socioeconomic privilege. When she worked in a high resourced (read: white, wealthy) hospital, access to uterus-saving equipment such as interventional radiology meant that she only did one hysterectomy in four years. Doctors at the hospital also came in on weekends to get a person with cancer into the OR immediately.\nNow, working at a \u201csafety net hospital,\u201d Dr. Mungo sees a stark difference. With non-existent interventional radiology and more part-time, \u201cless invested\u201d employees, Dr. Mungo has done three hysterectomies in three years \u2014 a 75% increase \u2014 and sees patients with time-sensitive conditions wait much longer before surgery. This \u201cseparate and unequal access to resources\u201d is a cause for concern.\u00a0\nDr. Mungo also stressed the need to make practices \u201csafe places\u201d for patients of color by increasing minority representation. Dr. Mungo explained that while Black physicians make up only 5% of doctors and 3% of faculty, there is strong evidence that patients who are cared for by someone of their own race or ethnicity have better outcomes. \u201cWe live in a racist society,\u201d Dr. Mungo stated, \u201cso we need specific anti-racist policies.\u201d\u00a0\nDr. Mungo also acknowledged that healthcare providers work within \u201ctemplates\u201d like 15 minute appointments, and posed the closing question, how can we make patients feel safe and heard within the constraints of modern medicine?\u00a0\nAnswering questions from the audience, Dr. Mungo and Huchko discussed medical algorithms that are based on race, like the VBAC calculator and GFR.\u00a0\nDr. Mungo indicted these algorithms as \u201can example of how institutionalized some [racial] biases are.\u201d There is \u201cno concrete evidence\u201d on why these corrections for race \u2014 which typically act to reduce the probability of success for a procedure or favorability of an outcome \u2014 exist. Dr. Mungo would urge providers \u201cnot to stop at, \u2018well, African Americans have an increased risk of diabetes.\u2019 Ask why. Have them explain food deserts\u2026 and structural and environmental racism.\u201d\nDr. Huchko stated that giving aspirin throughout pregnancy reduces preeclampsia, and is thus traditionally offered based on risk factors for preeclampsia, like low socioeconomic status and African American race. Sometimes, healthcare providers may not be able to address these risks without the acknowledgement of race as a risk factor. Dr. Huchko is right, African American women are at a higher risk for preeclampsia, and ignoring this correlation would probably do more harm than good.\u00a0\nBut per Dr. Mungo\u2019s appeal, providers must interrogate these associations more deeply \u2014 and be ever anti-racist in their efforts \u2014 if they are to create the safe spaces and trusting relationships that Mahendru, Dr. Huchko, and Dr. Mungo each hope to see.\nThis article was published in Duke Research\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section\nIn this section\n\nNews Sidebar Nav\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor Neighborhoods Linked to Elevated Dementia Risk and Faster Brain Aging\n\n\nFlight Attendants\u2019 Job Demands Linked to Menstrual Irregularities\u202f \n\n\nMaryAnn Black Symposium Centers Health Equity in 2nd Annual Community Event\n\n\nEDI Spotlight: Madhav Swaminathan, MD\n\n\nDuke-NCCU Partnership Honored with NIH Prize for Excellence in Diversity and Research  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nRSS feed\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedschool.duke.edu\n                  |\n                  duke.edu\n                  |\n                  dukehealth.org\n\n\n\n@2024 Duke University and Duke University Health System.\n                  All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
