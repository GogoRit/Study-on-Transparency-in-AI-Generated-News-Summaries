Kim Reynolds, but a judge is still considering abortion advocates\u2019 request to put the restrictions on hold.\nThe new legislation prohibits almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant. That\u2019s a dramatic shift for women in Iowa, where abortion had been legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.\nReynolds signed the measure into law in front of 2,000 conservative Christians barely a mile away from where a court hearing for the request to postpone\u00a0the state\u2019s new ban\u00a0took place. The ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed the legal challenge Wednesday and representatives spoke at the court hearing Friday.\nThat hearing ended with the judge saying a decision on whether to put a hold on the new ban may be made next week.\nDistrict Court Judge Joseph Seidlin said he could not imagine \u201canything that would be more insulting to either side\u201d than for him to \u201cflippantly\u201d rule from the bench Friday.\nThe split screen punctuates a bitter battle between abortion advocates and opponents in Iowa that has dragged on for years and will likely, for now, remain unresolved as the courts assess the law\u2019s constitutionality.\nAP-NORC POLL: Few U.S. adults support full abortion bans, even in states that have them\n\u201cAs we gather here today, at this very moment, the abortion industry is in the court trying to prevent this law from taking effect and stop once again the will of the people,\u201d Reynolds said before bringing people on the stage to sign the law. \u201cBut the passage of this legislation by even a wider margin this times sends an unmistakable message.\u201d\nThe\u00a0bill passed\u00a0with exclusively Republican support late on Tuesday at the conclusion of a rare, 14-hour special legislative session.\nThe new measure will be considered in the context of decisions by the\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0and\u00a0Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0last year, when both reversed themselves on rulings that had affirmed a woman\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to abortion.\nThose decisions prompted Reynolds to ask the court to reinstate her blocked 2018 law, which is nearly identical to the new one. The state\u2019s high court deadlocked last month, prompting Reynolds to call lawmakers back to the Iowa Capitol.\n\u201cPatients\u2019 lives are deeply impacted every day that this law is allowed to stand,\u201d said Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States. \u201cIowans will be harmed as they\u2019ve lost the right to control their bodies and futures. Iowans must have the freedom to make the best medical decisions for themselves and their families. We stand at the ready for our patients as we await the Court\u2019s decision and are prepared to help them get the reproductive health care they need regardless of the outcome.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood North Central States was planning to refer patients to other states, but remained hopeful there would not be a long interruption in services. As of Wednesday, 200 patients were scheduled for abortions at Iowa Planned Parenthood or the Emma Goldman Clinic this week and next, according to the court filings. Most of them past the six-week mark in their pregnancies.\nWATCH: House approves GOP-led defense bill that adds abortion restrictions, rolls back diversity initiatives\nOne Planned Parenthood clinic stayed open until about 9:30 p.m. Thursday in an effort to provide abortion care before the new restrictions, their attorney said.\n\u201cI can only hope that all patients who had appointments this morning have gotten the care that they need and that they\u2019re not sitting at a health center right now,\u201d the clinics\u2019 attorney Peter Im said during Friday\u2019s court arguments.\nIowa lawmakers passed the law in less time \u201cthan the 24 hour time period that\u2019s required for patients to wait before they get an abortion in Iowa,\u201d he said, adding that the status quo for the last 50 years has been for abortion pre-viability to be legal in Iowa.\n\u201cThis law, which on Tuesday the General Assembly passed in the dead of night after less than a day of deliberation, will violate Iowans constitutional rights and alter that status quo and have devastating consequences for Iowans,\u201d he said.\nThere are limited circumstances under the measure that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality \u201cincompatible with life\u201d; or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman.\nMost\u00a0Republican-led states\u00a0have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre put out an immediate statement saying Iowa\u2019s newly signed law is \u201can extreme abortion ban that will take away a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d\n\u201cWhile Republican elected officials advance dangerous laws, President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the majority of Americans who believe personal health care decisions should be between a woman and her doctor, not politicians, and will continue to call on Congress to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law,\u201d the statement said.\nBallentine contributed from Columbia, Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Iowa Gov.
