William McRaven, the former head of US Special Operations Command who oversaw the successful raid that killed Osama bin Laden, said he is voting for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.\n    \n\n            \u201cTruth be told, I am a pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, small-government, strong-defense and a national-anthem-standing conservative,\u201d McRaven wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Monday. \u201cBut, I also believe that black lives matter, that the Dreamers deserve a path to citizenship, that diversity and inclusion are essential to our national success, that education is the great equalizer, that climate change is real and that the First Amendment is the cornerstone of our democracy.\u201d\n    \n\nVisit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race\n\n\n            McRaven, who has been critical of President Donald Trump in the past, did not mention Trump by name in his op-ed. But he did explicitly name the President during an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper later Monday.\n    \n\n            \u201cIt was a difficult decision\u2026 to announce that I was voting. Obviously, you know, as a senior retired military officer these are challenging times and there\u2019s a little bit of an unwritten rule that senior officers don\u2019t come out and endorse a candidate,\u201d McRaven said on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cHowever, I felt that the direction of the country was heading in such a bad direction that we needed new leadership and that Joe Biden will be a much, much better leader than Donald Trump.\u201d\n    \n\n            In his op-ed titled \u201cBiden Will Make America Lead Again,\u201d McRaven warned that \u201cthe world no longer looks up to America\u201d and that \u201cwithout American leadership the world will indeed be transformed, just not in the way we hope.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cThey have been witness to our dismissiveness, our lack of respect and our transactional approach to global issues. They have seen us tear up our treaties, leave our allies on the battlefield and cozy up to despots and dictators,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey have seen our incompetence in handling the pandemic and the wildfires. They have seen us struggle with social injustice. They no longer think we can lead, because they have seen an ineptness and a disdain for civility that is beyond anything in their memory.\u201d\n    \n\nView 2020 presidential election polling\n\n\n            McRaven, who said he went to the polls in Texas this week, argued that the US needs a president \u201cwho understands the importance of American leadership, at home and abroad.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cWe need a leader of integrity whose decency and sense of respect reflects the values we expect from our president. We need a president for all Americans, not just half of America,\u201d he wrote. \n    \n\n            McRaven last year wrote a scathing op-ed in The New York Times in which he argued that the US is under attack from Trump. He told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d that Trump is \u201cundermining us from without.\u201d\n    \n\nBuild your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map\n\n\n            Trump has previously dismissed criticism from McRaven, labeling him a Hillary Clinton supporter in 2018.\n    \n\n            Last week, the President promoted a baseless conspiracy theory about Seal Team 6 and the bin Laden raid, leading to a rebuke by one of the Navy SEAL members who took part in the operation.\n    \n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from McRaven.\n\n\n  CNN\u2019s Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
