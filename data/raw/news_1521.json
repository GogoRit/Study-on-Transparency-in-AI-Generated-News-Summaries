The ruling was the first to undercut Texas\u2019 law since it took effect in 2022 and delivers a major victory to abortion rights supporters, who see the case as a potential blueprint to weaken restrictions elsewhere that Republican-led states have rushed to implement. However, the injunction was immediately blocked by an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, the state attorney general\u2019s office said.\u201dThe trial court\u2019s injunction is ineffective, and the status quo remains in effect,\u201d spokesperson Paige Willey said in an email.State District Judge Jessica Mangrum\u2019s ruling granted a temporary injunction that prevents Texas from enforcing the ban against physicians who in their \u201cgood faith judgment\u201d end a pregnancy that, because of complications, creates a risk of infection or is otherwise unsafe for the woman to continue.\n\nThe injunction also applies to women who have a condition \u201cexacerbated by pregnancy\u201d who can\u2019t be effectively treated during their term. It also covers cases where the fetus has a condition that makes it unlikely to survive after birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court extends block on Texas law that would allow police to arrest migrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina, Iowa, USC and Texas are the top seeds in the women\u2019s NCAA Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida reaches SEC final rallying from 18 down to beat Texas A&M 95-90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time, I cried for joy when I heard the news,\u201d lead plaintiff Amanda Zurawski said in a statement. \u201cThis is exactly why we did this. This is why we put ourselves through the pain and the trauma over and over again to share our experiences and the harms caused by these awful laws.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMangrum\u2019s decision said the injunction would run until the completion of the case, which is scheduled for a trial to begin next March 25.However, the state\u2019s immediate appeal \u201cstays an activist Austin judge\u2019s attempt to override Texas abortion laws pending a ruling by the Texas Supreme Court,\u201d said a statement from First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster.\n\nThe immediate impact of Mangrum\u2019s decision also was unclear in a state where all abortion clinics have shuttered in the past year. The challenge to the state law is believed to be the first in the U.S. brought by women who have been denied abortions since the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, which for nearly 50 years had affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion. In a six-page ruling, the judge found that portions of the abortion law violated the rights afforded to pregnant people under the Texas Constitution. The court found that the patients challenging the law each experienced \u201cemergent medical conditions\u201d during pregnancy that risked their health or lives \u201cand required abortion care.\u201dHowever, they were delayed or denied access to such care because of widespread uncertainty about the impact on physicians, the ruling said.\u201cToday\u2019s ruling should prevent other Texans from suffering the unthinkable trauma our plaintiffs endured,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which helped bring the lawsuit. \n\nDuring two days of emotional testimony in an Austin courtroom, women gave wrenching accounts of learning their babies would not survive birth and being unable to travel long distances to states where abortion is still legal. The challenge, filed in March, does not seek to repeal Texas\u2019 abortion ban, but instead aims to force more clarity on when exceptions are allowed under the law, which is one of the most restrictive in the U.S.Under the law in Texas, doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to $100,000. Opponents say that has left some women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy.The majority of U.S. adults, including those living in states with the strictest limits on abortion, want it to be legal at least through the initial stages of pregnancy, according to a poll released in late June by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
