Due to the volume of machines that the Knights of Columbus has been involved in purchasing, the agency is able to purchase its desired machine for $28,000.\u00a0\nCouncil 16604, with significant contributions from Council 15234 at Holy Family Church in Brentwood and Fourth Degree Assembly 3531, with members from Holy Family and St. Philip Church in Franklin, raised $14,000 toward the cost of the machine and the Supreme Council matched the amount raised locally.\u00a0\nPregnancy Centers of Middle Tennessee is headquartered in Columbia, with a satellite facility in Spring Hill, and is in the process of expanding operations into Franklin.\nThe agency receives no government funding and relies totally on donations from individuals, churches and charitable organizations. Twice per year Pregnancy Centers of Middle Tennessee has fundraising events to help cover daily operational costs. While there are some salaried personnel, a large percentage of the staff are volunteers. \u00a0\nBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, Pregnancy Centers of Middle Tennessee was seeing approximately 1,700 clients annually, resulting in more than 14,000 pregnancy related visits and more than 2,000 parenting classes. While the number of visits has reduced during the pandemic due to health safety concerns, it is expected that the number of clients will escalate once social distancing guidelines are relaxed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevPreviousSt. Michael parishioner finds comfort in May Crowning \n\n\n\n\nNextCamp Marymount makes adjustments, plans to openNext \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our email list\nKeep your finger on the pulse of Catholic life in Middle Tennessee by subscribing to the weekday\nE-Register here.\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address  *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSt. Mary\u2019s Bookstore a stop on Fontanini Tour\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 27, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNashvilleCatholic.org: a robust choir\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNovember 20, 2023\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAquinas College alumnus Col.
