The students are represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Arizona-based nonprofit. The lawsuit names college President Jessica Howard as well as its board and other top administrators as defendants. \nThe complaint argues that the college has prevented the student group from effectively communicating its message. Specifically, the complaint targets Chemeketa\u2019s policies that require students wanting to provide literature, display signs or engage others in the college\u2019s outdoor areas to receive permission two weeks in advance. These activities can only occur in two speech zones that make up less than 1.5% of the college\u2019s 100-acre campus, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThese policies and practices disable and chill protected student expression,\u201d the complaint said. \nAs a result of the policies, Chemeketa Students for Life was unable to engage with students in response to breaking news or legislation, according to the complaint. It mentioned how the group hosted a debate on campus in February about physician-assisted suicide but Sanchez was unable to hand out fliers promoting the event. As the U.S. Senate considered two abortion-related bills, the group was similarly unable to speak with students, distribute literature or display \u201ca poster showing fetal pain.\u201d\nThe complaint states that the college had similar policies but abandoned them in 2011 after a dispute over enforcement. \n\u201cChemeketa endeavors to uphold the constitutional rights and civil liberties of all student groups equally,\u201d Marie Hulett, the college\u2019s executive director for institutional advancement said in an email. \u201cWe are looking into the claims and will have more information available as appropriate, but our practice is to not comment about pending litigation.\u201d \nThe complaint seeks a court order preventing the college from enforcing the policies, attorney\u2019s fees and compensation to the students \u201cin an amount to be determined by the evidence.\u201d\nContact reporter Jake Thomas at 503-575-1251 or [email\u00a0protected] or @jakethomas2009.\n\ufeffSUPPORT SALEM REPORTER\u2019S JOURNALISM\u00a0\u2013 A monthly subscription starts at $5.
