Gov. Janice McGeachin, the Idaho Falls Republican who lost her gubernatorial bid in May.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\nPro-Life \u2014 a strawberry farmer known as Marvin Richardson before changing his name \u2014 is also running for lieutenant governor. Pro-Life, who runs for a different office every two years, said on his campaign website he would push to have all federally owned lands in Idaho transferred to the state, to have legal personhood defined as beginning at fertilization and to audit the federal reserve. Pro-Life has also called for banning openly LGBTQ+ people from serving in the United States miltary and said that no faithful Muslim can become a\u00a0 U.S. citizen.\n\n  Pro-Life, a strawberry farmer from Emmett who changed his name from Marvin Richardson, runs for office every two years in Idaho. (Courtesy of Pro-Life)\n\nPro-Life most recently ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020, winning 2.2% of the vote and finishing in third place in the race that U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, won.\nPro-Life lives in Emmett with his wife, Kirsten Faith Richardson.\n  Terri Pickens Manweiler says she is fighting to combat extremism \n\nPickens Manweiler is a trial attorney and founding partner of the firm Pickens Law in Boise. She has served on the board for Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky for more than five years.\u00a0\nPickens Manweiler has been campaigning for lieutenant governor since August 2021. She said her top priorities are pushing for LGBTQ+ rights, fighting for women\u2019s rights, reproductive health care rights, supporting public education, protecting Idaho\u2019s public lands and pushing back against extremism and the far right.\u00a0\nShe and her husband, Mark, live in Boise and have two children. Pickens Manweiler\u2019s daughter is gay, and Pickens Manweiler blames Bedke and the Idaho Legislature for failing to add the words \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201csexual orientation\u201d to the Idaho Human Rights Act. Manweiler said she testified in favor of adding those words as far back as 2014.\n\u201cHe never allowed it to get to the floor,\u201d Manweiler said. \u201cThat\u2019s on him. When I talk about my daughter\u2019s right to not be fired for who she is, I hold him responsible, and I hold the majority of the GOP responsible for not pressuring him.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\nDONATE\n\n\n\n\u00a0Although the lieutenant governor only gets to vote on legislation if the Idaho Senate is tied, Pickens Manweiler said she would use the office as a platform and an example for the state. She would use her office to research legislation that is coming up for a vote, share that information with the public and combat legislative disinformation and misinformation.\u00a0\n\u201cI will be able to stand up there with the gavel and I will be able to use my voice on the Senate floor and also to the general public,\u201d Pickens Manweiler said.\u00a0\nBy way of example, Pickens Manweiler said McGeachin demonstrated the power of the office of lieutenant governor by pushing the state to the right politically.\n\u201cThat platform, as we have seen used for bad, can also be used for good,\u201d Pickens Manweiler said.\u00a0\nPickens Manweiler ran unopposed in the Democrats\u2019 May primary election. She said she is confident she can defeat Bedke \u2014\u00a0because of an increase in young women who have registered to vote since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and because of what she describes as disgust among Idahoans who are concerned the Republican Party has pushed too far to the extreme right politically.\nNo Democrat has been elected to statewide office in Idaho in 20 years.\nPickens Manweiler said that, as the Idaho House of Representatives\u2019 highest ranking leader, Bedke is responsible for its shift to the right and the laws legislators pass.\n\u201cIn every single county I\u2019ve been to, and I\u2019ve been to 40, people said the same thing: \u2018Stop the crazy. We have to stop the shift to the far right,\u2019\u201d Manweiler said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a supermajority in the GOP that has shifted so far right that they are passing absolute garbage legislation, and it\u2019s an embarrassment to the people here in the middle of the road who love this state for what it is, not for what the far right wants it to be,\u201d Manweiler added.\u00a0\n Scott Bedke says he has the experience to do the job \n\nA rancher from Oakley whose family has been ranching there since 1870, Bedke is the longest serving speaker of the Idaho House in state history. Members of the Idaho House of Representatives elected him to the leadership post before the 2013 legislative session. Overall, Bedke has served 11 two-year terms in the Idaho House.\u00a0\nHe said he would bring the same leadership and approach to the lieutenant governor\u2019s office that he did in the Legislature, where the state amassed a record budget surplus, issued multiple income tax cuts and rebates and increased education funding.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen as speaker of the House is what you will see as lieutenant governor: someone who is very passionate about Idaho and its success,\u201d Bedke said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBedke said his policy experience is particularly strong on water and land management issues, as well as tax policy, transportation funding and education.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to education funding, Bedke said he used his legislative experience to work as a bridge between the governor\u2019s office and the Idaho Legislature to follow up on implementing the $410 million in education funding approved during the Sept. 1 special session. Bedke said he supports using the in-demand careers component of the money to expand trade school and career-technical education opportunities. He supports using the $330 million component of the public school funding allocation to pay for moving all public school teachers onto the state\u2019s health insurance program and keeping educators\u2019 salaries competitive enough to attract and retain good teachers.\n\u201cEvery classroom has got to have a well prepared, quality teacher and part of that is being paid adequately,\u201d Bedke said.\u00a0\nBedke said he would be an ally of Gov. Brad Little, if Little is re-elected, and would restore a collaborative relationship between the governor\u2019s office and lieutenant governor\u2019s office that became strained between McGeachin and Little.\u00a0\nBedke would also work with the governor and the 40-or-more new legislators who will be sworn in for the 2023 session following historic turnover in the Idaho Legislature.\n\u201cA lot of people are going to be brand new and coming into the system they are not going to be familiar with, and I can help with that,\u201d Bedke said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe role is not to create controversy,\u201d Bedke added. \u201cI would restore dignity to the office and restore the collaborative nature to the office. I will be in the room ahead of the decisions and a voice in that room. But I understand the difference between the No. 1 role and the No. 2 role.\u201d\nBedke secured the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor after defeating Rep. Prisiclla Giddings, R-White Bird, and Daniel Gasiorowski in the May 17 primary election.\u00a0\nBedke and his wife, Sarah, live in Oakley and raised four children.\n  Idaho\u2019s lieutenant governor candidates differ on abortion views \n\nAbortion is one of several issues where the candidates differ.\u00a0\nBedke is an anti-abortion conservative. He voted in favor of Senate Bill 1385, the 2020 trigger law that bans almost all abortions in Idaho following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Bedke also voted for Senate Bill 1309, the 2022 law that gives family members the right to sue the medical professional who performs an abortion.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI am very supportive of the U.S. Supreme Court recognizing that this is a policy decision and policy decisions should be made at the state level,\u201d Bedke said in an interview with the Sun. \u201cOn abortion my track record is clear. I am pro-life. But I think there are some very narrow and rare exceptions \u2014 if it involves the life of the mother or if it involves rape or incest.\u201d\nWhen asked about contraception, he said, \u201cwhen it comes to contraception, the government should stay out of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeed to get in touch?\nHave a news tip?\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n\n\nPickens Manweiler supports abortion rights and opposes the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\n\u201cWe lost a fundamental right to abortion in Idaho, which means women don\u2019t have bodily autonomy,\u201d Pickens Manweiler said.\u00a0\nPickens Manweiler said she fears the Republican-controlled Legislature will push to restrict more rights, including trying to outlaw contraception or the Plan B pill and trying to remove exemptions to the abortion ban.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere we are heading is (the Legislature) is going for no exceptions,\u201d Manweiler said.\u00a0\n\u00a0  What does Idaho\u2019s lieutenant governor do? \n\nIn Idaho, the lieutenant governor is a part-time position with limited responsibilities. According to the Idaho Constitution, the lieutenant governor serves as president of the Idaho Senate, but votes only to break a tie. The Idaho Constitution also states the lieutenant governor serves as acting governor \u201cin case of the failure to qualify, the impeachment, or conviction of treason, felony, or other infamous crime of the governor, or his death, removal from office, resignation, absence from the state, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office\u2026\u201d\nUnder Idaho law, in the case of the governor\u2019s death, resignation or permanent removal from office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term.\nBy law, the lieutenant governor\u2019s salary is set at 35% of the governor\u2019s salary. For 2023, the governor will earn $151,400, making the lieutenant governor\u2019s salary $52,990.\nLike other statewide offices, the lieutenant governor\u2019s term runs for four years.\u00a0\nDespite its limited official responsibilities, the office of lieutenant governor has served as a launching pad for several Idaho officials who held the post and then went on to run for\u00a0 higher office. Since 1977, five former Idaho lieutenant governors have gone on to serve as governor \u2014 Brad Little, Jim Risch, Butch Otter, Phil Batt and John Evans.\nUnlike the president and vice president, the governor and lieutenant governor in Idaho are elected separately and not as part of a single ticket. That doesn\u2019t mean the Republicans in Idaho\u2019s top executive posts have always seen eye-to-eye. Little and McGeachin are both longtime members of the Idaho GOP, but their clashes in recent years made national headlines.\nIdaho\u2019s voters have chosen Republicans for both offices since the 1980s and 1990s, when Idaho had Democratic governors and Republican lieutenant governors.\u00a0\nElection Day is set for Nov. 8, when polls across Idaho will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time for in-person voting. Absentee voting and early voting is already underway in Idaho. Registered voters have until Friday, Oct. 28, to request an absentee ballot. Interested voters who are not yet registered to vote may register at the polls on Election Day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXBedke, Pickens Manweiler and \u2018Pro-Life\u2019 running to become Idaho\u2019s next lieutenant governor\u00a0\nby Clark Corbin, Idaho Capital Sun November 7, 2022\nBedke, Pickens Manweiler and \u2018Pro-Life\u2019 running to become Idaho\u2019s next lieutenant governor\u00a0\nby Clark Corbin, Idaho Capital Sun November 7, 2022\n The race for Idaho\u2019s next lieutenant governor hinges on a clash between a longtime Republican legislative leader who pledged to work closely with the governor and Idaho Legislature, and a Democratic trial attorney who says she\u2019s running to shake up Idaho government, which she believes has moved too far to the right.\nSpeaker of the Idaho House of Representatives Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, and attorney Terri Pickens Manweiler, D-Boise, are running to succeed outgoing Lt.
