Parks/CR Staff)\n\nAfter years of preparation, the Center for Pregnancy Concerns is opening its newest Baltimore City location with a \u201cvirtual ribbon cutting.\u201d\u00a0\nOffering health screening and counseling services, Options@328 will operate out of a restored storefront next to the city\u2019s most prominent abortion provider, Planned Parenthood.\nConcerns about the coronavirus pandemic prevented a large in-person event, however, the Center for Pregnancy Concerns is moving the festivities online at 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 22. The event includes a virtual tour of Options@328 with Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori.\nArchbishop Lori joined Center for Pregnancy Concerns board members and Knights of Columbus Maryland State Deputy Vince Grauso as they cut a large pink ribbon to signal the opening of the center. Archbishop Lori blessed the site and offered a prayer for the success of the venture.\u00a0\nThe Center for Pregnancy Concerns spent almost $1 million to convert the rundown Howard Street building into a modern health center, which includes a new sonogram machine donated by the Knights of Columbus.\n\nMaryland State Council Knights of Columbus Grand Knight Vince Grauso presents a check to Archbishop William E. Lori and the Center for Center for Pregnancy Concerns Options @328 location on Howard Street in Baltimore City to cover the expense of an ultrasound machine following a Sept. 24 blessing and ribbon cutting ceremony. (Kevin J. Parks/CR Staff)\n\nOption@328, which is set to open to clients in the next few days, is primarily positioned to help change a woman\u2019s mind about having an abortion, but Executive Director Gina Ruppert said it can \u2013 in some cases \u2013 help women who have already started the process.\nRupert said Options@328 will help women who want to stop medication-induced abortions, which may be possible if women receive treatment within 24 hours of taking the first of two drugs that induce abortion. As part of the Abortion Pill Rescue Network, Option@328 will help women obtain the necessary prescription for the drug progesterone and monitor their health afterward.\nThe Abortion Pill Rescue Network says the progesterone treatment has a roughly 65 percent success rate if administered properly.\u00a0\nRupert said the center will help women access social services that could help support them during and after their pregnancies. She added that as a nondenominational Christian organization, it is prepared to give women spiritual as well as physical support.\nRuppert said it was important to have a location in the heart of Baltimore. Center for Pregnancy Concerns operates four centers, including one at St. Ann in East Baltimore and another at St. Rita in Dundalk, but Options@328 is the first downtown location.\n\nGina Ruppert is executive director of the Center for Pregnancy Concerns. (Kevin J. Parks/CR Staff)\n\nCarol Clews, the former executive director who launched the project, said being able to open a center next to Planned Parenthood was \u201cliterally a godsend.\u201d\n\u201cI absolutely believe that these mothers who come here thinking, very definitively about wanting to have an abortion, will see this and they will have second thoughts,\u201d Clews said.\nWith the nomination of federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court, abortion has again become a prominent issue as Americans cast ballots for the next president. If confirmed, Barrett is expected to cement the high courts\u2019 conservative majority. Barrett, a devout Catholic, has publicly opposed abortion. Liberal activists expect the new court with Barrett to severely weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that made abortion legal.\nWith political tensions running high, Ruppert said she wants the resource center to be a \u201cgood neighbor\u201d to Planned Parenthood and avoid any disturbances.\u00a0\nFor more information about how to take part in the Center for Pregnancy Concerns virtual ribbon-cutting event for Options@328, event visit https://cpcforhelp.org or https://bitly.com/3ddjuwa.\nEmail Tim Swift at tswift@CatholicReview.org\n\nMore Respect Life News\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. bishops urge prayer as high court poised to hear cases on pill used in abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life group deplores Harris\u2019 historic visit to Planned Parenthood abortion clinic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody of preterm baby found in Virginia pond prompts prayers, resource reminders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople touched by adoption look to St. Joseph in national novena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarchers at Maryland March for Life call for defeat of constitutional amendment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSister of murdered French priest tells story of forgiveness, friendship with killer\u2019s mother\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn boisterous State of the Union, Biden calls for Ukraine aid, abortion law and immigration reforms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs finalizes abortion policy deplored by U.S. military archbishop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlabama governor signs IVF bill pro-life groups call \u2018ill-considered\u2019 and \u2018unjust\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Catholic Review Media\n\u00a0Print\n\n\nPrimary Sidebar\nTim Swift\n\nTim Swift is a former social media coordinator for the Catholic Review and the Archdiocese of Baltimore.
