Some cancelled classes during a nationwide strike on Wednesday.Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday appeared to have broken ranks with the government and backed demonstrators, saying he thinks women should have the right to abortion in some cases.Poland is a largely conservative country compared to much of Europe, a place where churches fill up on Sundays and Roman Catholicism is deeply interwoven with the national identity.The country's abortion law, which was forged in 1993 between the political and Catholic church leaders of the time, allowed abortion only in the cases of fetal defects, risk to the woman\u2019s health and crimes \u2014 incest or rape.The law has been often described as a \u201ccompromise\u201d between those seeking liberal abortion regulations and the church, which favours a total ban.However, no side has ever been satisfied with the 1993 law, and women's groups demanding greater reproductive rights say it is no compromise at all.Earlier attempts by the conservative ruling party to change the law to ban all abortions were met with enormous street protests, including in 2016 and 2017.Share this articleComments\n                You might also like\n            \n                                        Poland: Eleventh day of anti-government, pro-abortion protests in several cities\n                                    \n                                        Polish farmers protest against Ukrainian imports and EU Green Deal\n                                    \n                                        Polish president Andrzej Duda calls on NATO members to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP\n                                    \n                    PiS\n                \n                    Poland\n                \n                    Abortion rights\n                ADVERTISEMENTTop stories\n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              The EU needs to boost ammunition deliveries to Ukraine: Charles Michel\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          EU Policy. \n            \n                               Exclusive: Commission eyes Biotech Act to boost bloc\u2019s life science sector\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          EU Policy. \n            \n                              Cybersecurity investment needs to be doubled, EU official says  \n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              German politician takes to TikTok to compete with far-right AfD\n                          \n                Now playing\n                \n              Next\n          \n                                      \n                              These European festivities turn satire into a popular celebration\n                          ADVERTISEMENTMost read\n                                      \n                              'Pseudo-election': European leaders condemn Putin's victory\n                          \n                                      \n                              What do you really know about St. Patrick's Day?\n                          \n                                      \n                              \u2018Stinking of tourist\u2019: Why M\u00e1laga locals have had enough of visitors\n                          \n                                      \n                              The EU passed the first AI law.
