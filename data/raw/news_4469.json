Campaigners fear setbacks on abortion, healthcare and more\n\nSpotlight falls on secretive Catholic group People of Praise\nSun 27 Sep 2020 15.31 BSTFirst published on Sun 27 Sep 2020 07.00 BSTShareRuth Bader Ginsburg was revered, a pioneering champion of gender equality. Her potential replacement on the supreme court threatens a systematic unraveling of hard-won rights that have given American women some semblance of autonomy and control.Trump set to pick Amy Coney Barrett for supreme court, stoking liberal backlashRead more\u201cIt is a particularly painful irony that much of her legacy is at great risk of being undone by another woman,\u201d said Lucinda Finley, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. \u201cA tragic irony.\u201dOn Saturday night, Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett. If confirmed, the 48-year-old will make history as only the second woman to join the court after nomination by a Republican president. But for women\u2019s rights experts, that will do little to mask what Trump actually wants: judicial philosophies warm to corporate interests but cool on healthcare and reproductive rights.\u201cThis vacancy represents a pivotal voice and moment in time where many of the freedoms that we have held dear really hang in the balance,\u201d warned Rachel Sussman, vice-president of state policy and advocacy at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.I don\u2019t have the capacity to think of how bad it can get when your intentions are to be cruelRachel Johnson-Farias, BerkeleyLooming over the confirmation process is an existential threat to Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that made abortion legal. Although White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany denied earlier this week that the president would ask any prospective nominee to \u201cprejudge\u201d Roe, Trump himself has promised to appoint \u201cpro-life justices\u201d and predicted that the ruling will be overturned.Trump has also signaled he wants justices who will vote to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which requires most healthcare plans to cover contraception with no out-of-pocket cost. Even with Ginsburg to dissent, the court majority \u2013 bolstered by Trump\u2019s first two appointees \u2013 ruled last summer practically all nongovernmental workplaces could flout ACA contraceptive mandates based on religious or moral objections, in line with Trump administration policy.In November, the justices, including Barrett if confirmed, will hear arguments on whether to scrap the ACA. That could jeopardize access to birth control, Finley warned.While women should realize \u201cit\u2019s all on the line\u201d in terms of reproductive rights, \u201cthey should also understand that it does not stop there\u201d, said Emily Martin, vice-president for education and workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.She expected a new Trump justice to make it more difficult for individuals to fight discrimination and harassment in the workplace, and easier for employers to force workers to waive their day in court.Precedent under siegeOne day after Ginsburg\u2019s death, Missouri senator Josh Hawley doubled down on his pledge to only vote for \u201cnominees who understand and acknowledge that Roe was wrongly decided\u201d.He may have an ally in Barrett: she has voted three times on abortion-related cases in the seventh US circuit court of appeals and has looked kindly on restrictions twice, according to Vox. On the third case, the court ruled anti-abortion activists could not approach women outside clinics and healthcare facilities.Seventeen abortion-related battles are one step away from the supreme court, and if Trump shifts it to a 6-3 conservative majority, any case that questions the constitutionality of abortion restrictions could be a vehicle to overturn Roe, Finley said, saying Roe is \u201cin the greatest jeopardy it\u2019s been [in] since it was issued in 1973\u201d.Rachel Johnson-Farias, executive director of the Center on Reproductive Rights and Justice at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said: \u201cIn terms of the cruelty we\u2019re seeing, maybe it\u2019s existed before, but definitely not in my lifetime.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have the capacity to think of how bad it can get when your intentions are to be cruel.\u201dView image in fullscreenCompeting protesters, outside the supreme court in June. Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPAMore than 25 million women \u201ccould lose access to safe, legal abortion\u201d if justices overturn Roe, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund estimates. Attacks on bodily autonomy invariably fall hardest on women of color and the poor, who cannot easily travel for an abortion, risk losing employment if they get pregnant, and are especially vulnerable to maternal morbidity and mortality.The judiciary has been attacking Roe with \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d, Johnson-Farias said, and even without the dramatic fanfare of fully overruling it, justices could implement de facto local abortion bans by simply allowing lower-court analyses to stand. In the last decade, 33 states have enacted 479 abortion restrictions, the Guttmacher Institute reports.\u201cThe only conclusion you can draw is that if we don\u2019t stop Trump and [Mitch] McConnell from filling Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat, Roe could be rendered meaningless before it\u2019s ever overturned,\u201d Sussman said. \u201cAnd for a lot of people, it already is.\u201d\u2018One more thumb on the scale\u2019When it comes to gender discrimination, evidence suggests female judges are more likely to rule in favor of the victim \u201ceven when you control for ideology\u201d, said Eve M Ringsmuth, associate professor of political science at Oklahoma State University.But Martin, of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, suspects a Trump appointee would likely buck that trend and add \u201cone more thumb on the scale\u201d, backing corporate interests on issues such as pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment.\u201cAll of it adds up to the laws against discrimination still being on the books, but having so many loopholes and so many barriers to enforcement that they have much less meaning and reach many fewer people,\u201d she said.'Not special any more': how the Senate has failed the American peopleRead moreShe anticipates \u201ca wave of cases\u201d testing whether, how and when companies \u201ccan violate sex discrimination laws in the name of religion\u201d, which \u201cin the past has been used to justify paying women less than men for the same job, or even for excluding women from the workplace entirely.\u201dThe implications could be far-reaching: unmarried women fired for getting pregnant or living out of wedlock, women losing their jobs after using in vitro fertilization. A life free of discrimination at work and school, or when buying property, \u201call of those questions really will be directly affected by this court seat,\u201d Martin said.\u201cWe are really at risk of having a lot of the rights that we have long depended on become much more difficult to enforce in reality.\u201dExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtUS constitution and civil libertiesLaw (US)US politicsTrump administrationUS domestic policyUS healthcareanalysisShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
