In a business where his celebrity peers typically sing the praises of abortion, everyone is asking the same question about the comedian: Is Chris Rock really pro-life? Let\u2019s examine the evidence so you can decide for yourself:\u00a0\u00a0\nRock Questions the \u201cSafety\u201d of Abortions:\u00a0\u00a0\nAt his most recent show in Atlantic City which sparked controversy over his abortion stance, Rock made fun of the popular myth propagated by the abortion industry that abortions are safe. Showing the ridiculousness of this notion, he said, \u201c[A] safe abortion is an abortion where only one person dies, I guess?\u201d Clearly, Rock is making the correct point that abortions can never be considered safe since the intention is always to kill a preborn baby.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(And abortion isn\u2019t safe for a mother, either by the way\u2014read more on maternal abortion risks HERE.)\u00a0\u00a0\nHe Said He\u2019s Not Pro-Choice\u2026Sort Of:\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the same show, Rock also claimed that he was not pro-choice. Instead, he joked that he was \u201cpro better choice,\u201d asserting that women should be choosier with the men they sleep with as their decision may result in the creation of a child.\u00a0\u00a0\nRock Makes a Good Point about Pro-Abortion Men:\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a different comedic bit, Rock also sheds light on the true colors of pro-abortion men who like to use abortion as a get-out-of-responsibility free card. He joked that he liked to pick up women at abortion rallies because he knew that they would be sexually active and open to aborting the potential consequences of their sexual promiscuity. Rock hits the nail on the head with his analysis of men who support abortion solely for the purpose of selfishly using this inhumane practice for their own personal gain.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(To read more about how America needs pro-life men, click HERE to read a Townhall op-ed by Students for Life of America Staff Writer Caroline Wharton entitled, \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is Pro-Life Men.\u201d)\u00a0\u00a0\nRock Paints a Picture of Ugly Abortion Culture:\u00a0\u00a0\nIn another bit, he also seemingly calls out the abortion industry for desensitizing women to the horror of abortion as he paints a verbal picture of women flippantly choosing to abort.\u00a0\u00a0\nRock joked, \u201cWhen a woman gets pregnant, it\u2019s a choice between the woman and her girlfriends. One girlfriend goes, \u2018Child, you should have that baby\u2014that man got some good hair\u2026\u2019 And the other girlfriend says, \u2018Child, why we even talking about this\u2014ain\u2019t we supposed to go to Cancun next week? Get rid of that baby!\u2019 And that is how life is decided in America.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRock\u2019s point is illustrated by abortion vendors like Planned Parenthood saying to the public that \u201ceveryone has their own unique and valid reasons for having an abortion.\u201d This kind of mindset allows abortion to be used whenever and for whatever reasons\u2014but in actuality, there is never a good reason to abort. (And if you think rape and incest count as acceptable reasons to abort, click HERE to learn why that\u2019s not the case; two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.)\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat Do You Think: Is Chris Rock Pro-Life?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile he hasn\u2019t publicly made his stance on abortion known, all signs seem to lead to maybe. Rock truly does recognize some of the problems with the abortion lobby, and we do pray that his poignant comedy will plant some pro-life seeds in his listeners, regardless of whether that sowing is intentional or not. Rock is always welcome in the pro-life movement, but for the meantime, we\u2019ll enjoy listening to him roast the abortion lobby. Keep it up, Chris Rock!\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: These Lizzo Abortion Quotes Sure Don\u2019t Seem Like Women\u2019s Empowerment\n\n Post Views: 2,047\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
