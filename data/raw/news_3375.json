Mike Lee, R-Utah,  before a meeting on Capitol Hill March 9. (photo: Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nNation\nMarch 9, 2022\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As the U.S. Senate prepares to evaluate President Biden\u2019s first pick for the Supreme Court, pro-life legal experts assert that she is a far-left choice who will likely be no friend to the movement defending the rights of the unborn.\u00a0\nRobert George, the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University, told the Register that Jackson\u2019s jurisprudence \u201cis very much in the progressive mode that understands courts as licensed to rule in ways that will advance progressive political causes, cases like Roe v. Wade, for example.\u201d\u00a0\nIf confirmed, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge\u2019s appointment would not alter the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative supermajority, as she would replace Justice Stephen Breyer, the author of three landmark decisions that overturned state laws restricting abortion and has otherwise been regarded as a somewhat moderate liberal.\u00a0\nNevertheless, questions have been raised about whether she might move the court farther to the left, given her record and the groups pushing her appointment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI voted against confirming Judge Jackson to her current position less than a year ago,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell after Biden announced his choice. \u201cSince then, I understand that she has published a total of two opinions, both in the last few weeks, and that one of her prior rulings was just reversed by a unanimous panel of her present colleagues on the D.C. Circuit.\u201d\u00a0\nMcConnell asserted that Jackson was \u201cthe favored choice of far-left dark-money groups,\u201d a claim repeated by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who had pressed for Biden to select District Judge Michelle Childs, from his home state South Carolina.\u00a0\nA graduate of Harvard Law School, where she was the supervising editor of the Harvard Law Review, Jackson also clerked for Breyer and served as a public defender and then a district-court judge.\nIn 2021, the Senate confirmed her nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups that have set the Democrat Party\u2019s priorities for criminal-justice reform and the Supreme Court have applauded Jackson\u2019s past record as a public defender and vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\u00a0\n\u201cJackson supported Sentencing Commission action to make retroactive a reduction in penalties for crack cocaine, resulting in over 12,000 people being eligible to request reduced sentences,\u201d Demand Justice, a group that advocates for criminal-justice reform and packing the Supreme Court, stated on its website.\u00a0\nAnd NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju echoed the praise of Biden\u2019s decision to select Jackson as the first Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court. \u201cConfirming Judge Jackson is a crucial opportunity to shape the Supreme Court in the decades to come,\u201d she said, while warning that the jurist\u2019s confirmation would not affect the outcome of a groundbreaking Mississippi abortion case now before the court that will be decided by early July and could overturn Roe.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJackson\u2019s Abortion Record\nPro-life leaders and legal experts, for their part, called out Jackson\u2019s record on abortion, pointing to her 2001 friend-of-the-court briefing in a Massachusetts case. This brief is the only example of Jackson speaking to the abortion issue.\u00a0\nJackson co-wrote the amicus brief on behalf of abortion providers who supported a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d that prevented pro-life counselors in the Bay State from approaching women outside abortion businesses.\u00a0\n\u201cThe government has a substantial interest in controlling activity around medical facilities and in protecting patients entering those facilities from unwanted confrontations,\u201d read the brief.\n\u201cFew American citizens who seek to exercise constitutionally protected rights must run a gauntlet through a hostile, noisy crowd of \u2018in-your-face\u2019 protesters,\u201d the brief continued. \u201cStill fewer citizens, when seeking medical or surgical care \u2014 particularly care involving deeply private matters \u2014 must confront a crowd swarming around them, shouting in their faces, blocking their way, and thrusting disturbing photographs and objects at them. Yet on any given day, patients of reproductive health clinics may face all of these.\u201d\nIn response to objections about the law permitting facility escorts around these women while barring pro-life counselors, the brief that Jackson co-authored claimed that these women were \u201cpresumptively\u201d less willing to hear from pro-lifers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine an audience more \u2018presumptively unwilling\u2019 to hear protesting by anti-abortion protesters than women entering a clinic for the purpose of having an abortion,\u201d according to the brief. \u201cBy contrast, however, those women can be presumed to be amenable to assistance by the clinic escorts, whose role is to help these women accomplish physical entry into the clinic facilities.\u201d\nCarrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a legal advocacy group, told the Register that language in that brief \u201cbetrayed assumptions about clinic protesters that I don\u2019t think are fair.\u201d\u00a0\nThe brief\u2019s description of the pro-life demonstrators as a \u201cnoisy crowd\u201d did not conform with her own experience with such protests.\n\u201cUnfortunately, when judges and justices allow their preconceived kind of political notions of what\u2019s really going on to sneak in rather than confining themselves to the actual judicial and legal questions before them, it can lead them to effectively be doing improper fact-finding about what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Severino, who is a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThose on the conservative side think that how one operates as a judge is very fundamentally different from how one approaches the task of legislation and that how you would vote in a legislature is of no relevance to the question of how you should vote as a judge,\u201d commented George. \u201cBut progressives don\u2019t have any such scruples, so I expect her to be pretty much a standard-issue progressive jurist.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProgressive Backing\nSeverino said that President Biden \u201cchose the nominee that had the strongest liberal bona fides and had the most support from the activist groups on the left.\u201d Leftist groups, including Demand Justice, wrote a letter to Biden prior to Jackson\u2019s nomination pushing for someone with this particular background when the president had narrowed his choice down to three candidates. At the time, Biden had reportedly interviewed Jackson, Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.\nGeorge said that of the three judges that Biden considered, Jackson was likely \u201cthe one who would be most acceptable to the most progressive wing of the party.\u201d He noted that Childs, a favorite of House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., \u201cwas considered too moderate and too willing to compromise or accommodate the folks on the more conservative side.\u201d\u00a0\nSeverino also noted that Jackson \u201cis the most extreme nominee of the ones he was likely to pick,\u201d adding that \u201cshe\u2019s replacing a liberal justice, but I think she would definitely move the court to the left because Justice Breyer was someone who is much more likely to come to compromise positions with the conservatives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Breyer spoke out against court-packing in a Harvard speech last year. In contrast, Jackson did not weigh in on the matter when questioned by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., during her circuit-court confirmation hearing in April. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to comment on proposals about the structure of the court, about expanding the court or anything of the sort,\u201d she said at the time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDistrict Court Record\nSeverino said that when it comes to Jackson\u2019s record on the D.C. district court, \u201cshe had really a record number of reversals by the appellate court,\u201d which is of concern because \u201cshe was being reversed by even some of the most liberal members of the court and in cases where they concluded she didn\u2019t even have the jurisdiction to make the decisions she did.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSome of these include Trump regulations that she was overturning when she didn\u2019t have authority to do so,\u201d Severino said, \u201cand in some cases going into gratuitous side commentaries about the policy issues rather than confining herself to the legal role.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one case cited by Severino, Make the Road New York v. McAleenan, Jackson temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Homeland Security from expanding an expedited removal process of illegal immigrants who had been in the country for 14 days to include those who had been in the U.S. for up to two years. Jackson wrote that \u201cDHS failed to address significant flaws in the expedited removal system, nor does it appear that the agency considered the potential impact of the expansion of that system on settled undocumented noncitizens and their communities.\u201d\nThe D.C. Circuit later reversed Jackson\u2019s decision, noting that \u201cfederal law commits to the \u2018sole and unreviewable discretion\u2019 of the Secretary of Homeland Security the decision whether to subject certain individuals present in the United States without documentation to \u2018expedited removal.\u2019\u201d\nSeverino also noted the dramatic language of Jackson\u2019s 2019 ruling in Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn, in which Jackson rejected a claim of executive privilege and held that former White House Counsel Don McGahn had to testify in an investigation of President Trump.\u00a0\n\u201cStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cThis means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control. Rather, in this land of liberty, it is indisputable that current and former employees of the White House work for the People of the United States, and that they take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nPro-Life Groups\u2019 Concerns\nWhile Jackson has not spelled out her views on abortion, President Biden replied \u201cYes\u201d to the question of whether there would be a litmus test on abortion for his Supreme Court nominees during the February 2020 Democratic presidential debate. He said that a \u201clitmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution. A woman does have a right to choose.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf it is true that President Biden has nominated someone based upon a pro-abortion litmus test, the Senate Judiciary Committee is duty-bound to block any nominee from advancing to the Senate floor, until the American people can make their voices heard on the future of the Supreme Court through the upcoming Senate elections,\u201d Katie Glenn, government affairs counsel at Americans United for Life, said.\n\u201cJoe Biden is fulfilling his promise to only appoint justices who support the Roe v. Wade regime of abortion on demand up to birth,\u201d Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. \u201cKetanji Brown Jackson is backed by many of America\u2019s most radical pro-abortion groups. She is on record opposing the free-speech rights of pro-life advocates pleading to save lives outside abortion centers and supporting the false claim that abortion is \u2018health care.\u2019 We have no doubt she will work with the most pro-abortion administration in history to enshrine abortion on demand nationwide in the law.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \nketanji brown jackson\nsupreme court nominations\nu.s. supreme court\nbiden administration\nlauretta brown\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Things to Know About Supreme Court Nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the SBA List, said of Biden's nomination, \u201cWe have no doubt she will work with the most pro-abortion administration in history to enshrine abortion on demand nationwide in the law.\u201d\n\n\nKatie Yoder/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Confirms Ketanji Brown Jackson to Become First Black Woman on Supreme Court\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah \u2014 joined with the Senate\u2019s 50 Democrats to secure Jackson\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\nShannon Mullen/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Senate Set to Vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee\u2019s vote on President Joe Biden\u2019s nominee ended in a tie.\n\n\nKatie Yoder/CNA\nNation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Justice Jackson Protect Religious Freedom?\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson\u2019s recent recognition that religious freedom is a \u2018foundational constitutional right\u2019 is important.
