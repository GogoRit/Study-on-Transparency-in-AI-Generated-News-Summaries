Wade. A medical group says some Texas hospitals have been denying or delaying care to pregnant patients over fears of violating statewide abortion restrictions.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Sergio Flores for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThe Texas Medical Association is asking state regulators to step in after it says several hospitals afraid of violating the state\u2019s abortion ban have turned away pregnant patients or delayed care leading to complications, The Dallas Morning News reported.\nIn a letter to the Texas Medical Board \u2014 the state agency that regulates the practice of medicine \u2014 TMA officials on Wednesday said they have received complaints that hospital administrators and their legal teams are stopping doctors from providing medically appropriate care to patients with some pregnancy complications. They ask the board to \u201cswiftly act to prevent any wrongful intrusion into the practice of medicine.\u201d\nTMA is a professional nonprofit that represents over 55,000 medical professionals in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe request comes as confusion and concerns abound among Texas medical professionals over what they can and cannot do under Texas\u2019 abortion ban.\nBeyond elective abortions, there are several situations in which a doctor might advise an abortion for the safety of the patient \u2014 including ectopic pregnancies, in which a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus, making it unviable \u2014 or provide other stabilizing treatments during hypertension and preeclampsia. Delays in treatment can cause serious health complications.\nBut in a post-Roe world, physicians in states where abortion has been banned have to weigh the legal implications of their actions, instead of making decisions based on what prevailing medical literature recommends. In Texas, doctors can face six-figure fines and be put in jail for any disallowed abortions.\nAccording to the Morning News, the TMA included in its letter examples of some cases in which treatment was denied or delayed but did not name specific hospitals. In Central Texas, a physician was allegedly instructed to not treat an ectopic pregnancy until a rupture occurred, which puts patient health at serious risk, the letter says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDelayed or prevented care in this scenario creates a substantial risk for the patient\u2019s future reproductive ability and poses serious risk to the patient\u2019s immediate physical wellbeing,\u201d the letter says.\nThe TMA letter also accused two other hospitals of telling doctors to turn away pregnant patients and send them home to \u201cexpel the fetus\u201d if their water broke too soon, which can put them at risk of infection.\nNot only are patients being put at risk of serious injury, but doctors could face lawsuits or the loss of their medical licenses for not providing adequate care, the TMA letter says. Failing to do so might violate the state\u2019s prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine, which generally prohibits corporations or nonphysicians from practicing medicine.\nThe TMA\u2019s plea comes one day after Texas sued the Biden administration to block new federal guidance reiterating to the nation\u2019s doctors that they\u2019re protected by federal law to terminate a pregnancy as part of emergency treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration warned that federal dollars could be pulled from institutions that fail to provide care.\nTexas\u2019 abortion restrictions \u2014 a ban that prohibits most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, as well as a law passed last year that will ban nearly all abortions, plus older statutes that outlawed the procedure before Roe \u2014 have made care for pregnant people more challenging than ever, health care providers say.\nWithout medical assistance during a miscarriage, especially later in the pregnancy, patients face risks such as deadly hemorrhaging and sepsis. Texas abortion laws make exceptions for the procedure if the mother\u2019s life is in danger, but even that is fraught with uncertainty, doctors say.\nSome medical providers say they\u2019re forced to delay or reconsider what treatment options they can prescribe due to the laws, particularly in the cases of those with high-risk pregnancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany doctors, legal experts and anti-abortion groups have said the state\u2019s abortion ban shouldn\u2019t apply to miscarriages and life-threatening complications.\nTexas laws against abortions \u2014 including the 1925 law the Texas Supreme Court allowed to go back into effect while the U.S. Supreme Court issues the judgment that will formally end Roe v. Wade and the trigger law that will then kick in \u2014 make exceptions in cases in which an abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother.\nThe trigger law, which will go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, also adds an exception for when a person risks \u201csubstantial impairment of major bodily function.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s definition of abortion, clarified by state lawmakers in recent years, explicitly says treatments for miscarriages, known as \u201cspontaneous abortions\u201d in medicine, and ectopic pregnancies do not count as abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas statutes define abortion as \u201cthe act of using or prescribing an instrument, a drug, a medicine, or any other substance, device, or means with the intent to cause the death of an unborn child of a woman known to be pregnant.\u201d\nAbortions do not include \u201cbirth control devices or oral contraceptives,\u201d according to the statutes, and treatments to \u201cremove a dead, unborn child whose death was caused by spontaneous abortion\u201d or to \u201cremove an ectopic pregnancy\u201d or to \u201csave the life or preserve the health of an unborn child.\u201d\nSome doctors in Texas have already faced issues since a law last fall outlawed most abortions past six weeks. And others in the health care industry have kept far away from anything that could be interpreted as running afoul of the state\u2019s abortion laws.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing pharmacists not want to fill certain medications,\u201d said Dr. Natalie Crawford, co-founder of Fora Fertility in Austin, which also sees patients during their first trimester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion-inducing medication is the most common method used by Texans to terminate pregnancies, according to Texas Health and Human Services. But it also has a broad range of other uses in obstetrics and gynecology, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, including medical management of miscarriage, induction of labor, cervical dilation before surgical procedures and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.\nFor example, an incomplete miscarriage may require the use of abortion-inducing medications to prevent infection from any remaining tissue. Other times, a patient may not realize they have lost their pregnancy until they go in for a medical exam, and they may not want to wait until their body begins the process of releasing it naturally, one Texas physician told NPR.\nThe medications are also used beyond reproductive care. Misoprostol helps prevent stomach ulcers, but it can induce abortions if taken along with mifepristone.\nMethotrexate, another abortion-inducing medication, is used to treat ectopic pregnancies as well as rheumatic illnesses, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Texas law enacted last year forbids dispensing and shipping abortion-inducing medications past seven weeks, but it makes exceptions for when they are used for \u201cother medical reasons.\u201d\nDr. John Thoppil, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said doctors usually note a diagnosis when prescribing medicines, and prescription rejections don\u2019t appear to be widespread.\nIf patients run into trouble filling prescriptions, Thoppil and Crawford say they should try to find another pharmacy or talk to their health care provider.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a large issue, but there are certainly anecdotes,\u201d Thoppil said. \u201cThankfully, I think there\u2019s still plenty of pharmacies that understand the proper utilization of some of the medications we use for nonelective [pregnancy] terminations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been in communication with some pharmacy leaders to \u201chelp clarify proper interpretation of the rules.\u201d\nAnd on Wednesday, the Biden administration also warned retail pharmacies that they must fill prescriptions for pills that can induce abortion or risk violating federal civil rights law.\nStill, Crawford said doctors worry about delays in care, particularly for first trimester conditions such as bleeding, hemorrhaging, septic miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.\n\u201cThose can be acute life-threatening emergencies,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why Crawford said it\u2019s important for patients to quickly seek help if they notice their pregnancy isn\u2019t progressing normally.\n\u201cPlease go and seek medical care if you\u2019re having bleeding in pregnancy. If you\u2019re having severe pain, if you\u2019re getting a fever, you need to keep your medical team in the loop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to keep you safe.\u201d\nThe Texas Tribune\u2019s Karen Harper contributed to this story.\nDisclosure: Texas Medical Association has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
