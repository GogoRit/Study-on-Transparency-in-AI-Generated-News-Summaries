Church leaders and Catholic pro-life advocates were quick to criticize the senators\u2019 votes after the measure was defeated on Feb. 28.\n\u201cCatholics are tired of seeing their faith used as a political football on the campaign trail, then thrown aside by Catholic political figures when they need to vote along the party line against the Church\u2019s most fundamental moral teachings,\u201d Joshua Mercer, the communications director for CatholicVote, said Monday.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the standout examples tonight was Sen. Bob Casey, a self-proclaimed Catholic who has again and again presented himself to Catholic voters as pro-life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, took to Twitter to denounce that state\u2019s two Democrat senators\u00a0 \u2014 Jack Reed, a Catholic, and Sheldon Whitehouse \u2014 for supporting what Tobin called a \u201cvery extreme pro-abortion bill.\u201d\n\u201cShameful. The judgement will be God\u2019s,\u201d he tweeted, citing Pope Francis statement that abortion is murder.\nFortunately, the very extreme pro-abortion bill did not pass in the U.S. Senate. Unfortunately, both R.I.\u2019s Senators, Reed and Whitehouse voted for its approval. Shameful. The judgement will be God\u2019s. \u201cAbortion is murder.\u201d (Pope Francis)\u2014 Bishop Thomas Tobin (@ThomasJTobin1) February 28, 2022 \nThe following Catholic senators voted in favor of the bill: Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.; Bob Casey, D-Penn; Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Tim Kaine, D-Va.; Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Bob Menendez, D-N.J.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and Jack Reed, D-R.I.\nWhile Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., was absent, he co-sponsored the bill.\nAnother Catholic, President Joe Biden, strongly supported the measure and would have signed it into law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt a time when women\u2019s access to reproductive health care is under increased assault in states across the country, it is extremely disappointing that Senate Republicans blocked passage of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would strengthen health care access and codify constitutional rights affirmed half a century ago by Roe v. Wade and in subsequent Supreme Court precedent,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a March 1 statement. \u201cThis is a moment for us to recommit to strengthening access to women\u2019s health care, defend the constitutional right affirmed by Roe, and protect the freedom of all people to build their own future.\u201d\n\u00a0A hedge against Roe\u2019s demise\nPro-choice Democrats sought to pass the bill to enshrine and even broaden the legalized abortion framework created 49 years ago by the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe urgency to pass the bill stemmed from fears that the U.S. Supreme Court may strike down Roe later this year in the Mississippi abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nIn the end, though, the bill failed to garner the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. The final vote \u2014 46 for and 48 against the WHPA \u2014 fell mostly along party lines, with just one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voting against it.\nIn a Feb. 28 press release, Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-Life Activities, and Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, chairman of the Committee for Religious Liberty, criticized the WHPA, also known as H.R. 3755.\n\u201cThe failure to advance this extreme measure today is a tremendous relief,\u201d the prelates stated. \u201cPassing H.R. 3755 would have led to the loss of millions of unborn lives and left countless women to suffer from the physical and emotional trauma of abortion.\u201d\n\nMore in US\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know how to make \u2018St. Joseph\u2019s bread\u2019? Here\u2019s the recipe\nRead article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRather than providing comprehensive material and social support for a challenging pregnancy, H.R. 3755 fails women and young girls in need by instead offering a free abortion as the \u2018solution\u2019 to their difficulty,\u201d they added. \u201cWomen deserve better than this. We implore Congress to promote policies that recognize the value and human dignity of both mother and child.\u201d\nClear Church teaching\nThe Catholic Church condemns abortion in the strongest possible terms.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church, which summarizes Church teaching, recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of the unborn human person and considers abortion a \u201ccrime against human life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception,\u201d the catechism reads. \u201cFrom the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2013 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\u201d\nIn his Evangelium Vitae encyclical, Pope St. John Paul II addressed abortion in light of politics.\n\u201cI repeat once more that a law which violates an innocent person's natural right to life is unjust and, as such, is not valid as a law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor this reason I urgently appeal once more to all political leaders not to pass laws which, by disregarding the dignity of the person, undermine the very fabric of society.\u201d\n(Story continues below)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\n\n\n\nThe \u201cChurch encourages political leaders, starting with those who are Christians, not to give in, but to make those choices which, taking into account what is realistically attainable, will lead to the re- establishment of a just order in the defence and promotion of the value of life,\u201d he added.\nThe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith later explained the late pontiff\u2019s teaching in a doctrinal note on \u201cThe Participation of Catholics in Political Life.\u201d\n\u201cJohn Paul II, continuing the constant teaching of the Church, has reiterated many times that those who are directly involved in lawmaking bodies have a grave and clear obligation to oppose any law that attacks human life,\u201d it read. \u201cFor them, as for every Catholic, it is impossible to promote such laws or to vote for them.\u201d\nA total of 11 Catholic senators, including Manchin, voted against the WHPA. They are: Mike Braun, R-Ind.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; John Hoeven, R-N.D.; Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Jim Risch, R-Idaho; Mike Rounds, R-S.D.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska; Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Pat Toomey, R-Penn.\n\n\nTags:\nUSCCB - United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nCatholic News, \nPro-life advocacy, \nAbortion in the United States, \nPresident Joe Biden, \nWomen's Health Protection Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Washington, D.
