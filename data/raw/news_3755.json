What a novel idea.By Liz PlankPublished: Apr 24, 2020 3:33 PM ESTSave ArticleRaydene Hansen//Getty ImagesYou\u2019ve seen the protests: Dozens of mostly white men and women, some wearing homemade face masks, some in bright-red baseball caps that say you-know-what, holding up signs that read \u201cLand of the free\u201d and \u201cGive me liberty or give me COVID-19.\u201d They\u2019re screaming the classics like \u201cIt\u2019s a free country! America the free!\u201d at state capitol buildings and even shouting offensive racial epithets at health care workers in scrubs. For obvious reasons, these protests bother me: I, along with everyone I know, am currently staying at home, doing my part to flatten the curve to make sure that our hospitals don\u2019t get any more overwhelmed than they already are. But there\u2019s another reality here that really gets me: Suddenly Trump supporters are demanding that their government butt out so that they can make decisions about their health and well-being all by themselves? Funny, I don\u2019t think I saw these guys at the last Women\u2019s March. Now, of course I don\u2019t know whether these protesters are pro-choice or not, but I do know a couple things: The states that have been the slowest to move on crucial government-mandated social distancing guidelines have been red states. Some of the largest protests happened in states like Texas, Ohio, and Oklahoma\u2014which just so happen to be states where Republicans have used the coronavirus to try and ban women from getting abortions. And it\u2019s been well-reported that these protests are being organized by influential conservative funders, many of whom have close ties to the Trump administration. Barcroft Media//Getty ImagesA sign at a protest in Albany, New York. Watching some of the most staunchly anti-abortion Republicans, like Congressman Jim Jordan, hail these demonstrators as heroes of freedom particularly stings. \u201cI applaud these people for speaking up and defending liberty,\u201d Jordan told The Atlantic. Should I look forward to receiving the same comment when I ask him about the next pro-choice rally opposing all the bills he has voted for? I won\u2019t hold my breath. Related StoryCOVID-19 Doesn\u2019t Have a Race Problem, America DoesMy message to these protestors\u2014and more importantly, the conservative elites inciting them\u2014is simple: If the government can\u2019t interfere in saving you from a deadly virus, then how can you argue it should be allowed to interfere in a woman\u2019s right to choose? This hypocrisy is bad for your brand! You can\u2019t say you want the freedom to die but refuse women\u2019s right to freaking live. If we weren\u2019t living in a dystopian novel and the human population wasn\u2019t being decimated by a contagious disease, maybe we\u2019d be given a lil accountability, you know, as a treat. Perhaps we would even use this crisis to reflect on the fact that it is preposterous that our country still entertains the idea that the government should be able to make women\u2019s decisions for them. But the conservative party won\u2019t suddenly have an epiphany that women are free-thinking, independent people because they are shameless: They use their base to defend the indefensible. You can\u2019t say you want the freedom to die but refuse women\u2019s right to freaking live.Look no further than the fact that influential wealthy conservative elites are currently enticing vulnerable people to protest a virus that\u2019s quite literally killing them. They are willfully putting demonstrators at risk by encouraging them to do the one thing that puts them closer to death\u2019s way: gather in large groups without any protection. This isn\u2019t just exploitative, it\u2019s Machiavellian. Tom Williams//Getty ImagesA demonstrator in Virginia.Sadly, none of this is even the slightest bit surprising. The GOP\u2019s deadliest weapon is their unbridled drive to exploit their base\u2019s deepest pain for personal profit. It happens with pretty much every cause under the sun, from immigration to climate change to health care and to, of course, reproductive rights.And so, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be even more misguided protests over the weekend to keep me busy (i.e., screaming at my TV). And the weekend after. And probably the weekend after. Until at least the Republican party and its wealthy stakeholders encourage some other selfish, self-defeating action in the fight for \u201cfreedom.\u201d In the meantime, maybe I\u2019d feel better if they\u2019d just add an asterisk to their \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d protest signs.
