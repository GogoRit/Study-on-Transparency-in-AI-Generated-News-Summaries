Activists deplored the decision, and the Council of Europe\u2019s human rights commissioner wrote on Twitter that it was a \u201csad day for women\u2019s rights.\u201d Hours later, hundreds of mostly young protesters defied a pandemic-related ban on gatherings and staged a protest before the court with signs saying \u201cYou Have Blood on Your Gowns\u201d and \u201cShame.\u201d The demonstrators then walked to the offices of the main ruling conservative party, Law and Justice, and to the house of the party leader and deputy prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is the driving force behind the government\u2019s policies. Police cordoned the house off from the noisy protesters who were calling for the government to step down. Officers briefly tussled with some people, took their banners and sprayed pepper gas to disperse the crowd. \n\nThe ruling party will soon propose new legislation to better support women and their children that will be born as a result of the court\u2019s ruling, the party\u2019s spokeswoman said. \nThe court\u2019s decision came in response to a motion from right-wing lawmakers who argued that terminating a pregnancy due to fetal defects \u2014 the most common reason cited for legal abortions in Poland \u2014 violates a constitutional provision that calls for protecting the life of every individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court argued that terminating pregnancy due to defects of the fetus amounted to eugenics \u2014 a 19th century notion of genetic selection that was later applied by the Nazis in their pseudo-scientific experiments.It agreed with the plaintiffs that it was a form of banned discrimination when the decision about an unborn child\u2019s life was conditioned on its health. \n\nThe challenged law was introduced by Poland\u2019s young post-communist democracy in 1993 as a hard-won compromise between the influential Catholic Church and the state authorities. It allows abortions when a pregnancy endangers a woman\u2019s health or life, or results from rape or other illegal act, and also in case of congenital defects. Only the last provision was challenged.Even before Thursday\u2019s ruling, many Polish women have sought abortions abroad. Health Ministry figures show that 1,110 legal abortions were held in Poland in 2019, mostly because of fetal defects.In justifying its decision, the court said \u201cthere can be no protection of the dignity of an individual without the protection of life.\u201dThe verdict was announced by the court\u2019s president, Julia Przylebska, a loyalist of the right-wing government that is focused on family and Catholic values. Przylebska\u2019s appointment to the court in 2015 was one of the government\u2019s first steps toward taking control of the judiciary. These steps have drawn condemnation from the European Union which says they violate the democratic principle of the rule of law. \n\nArchbishop Marek Jedraszewski, known for his strong conservative views, hailed the verdict and expressed \u201cgreat appreciation for the courage\u201d of the judges in the defense of human life \u201cfrom the moment of conception to the (moment of) natural death.\u201d But opposition lawmakers lashed out.The head of the Civic Coalition, Borys Budka, said on Twitter that the government used a \u201cfalse\u201d court of its own appointees to do something \u201csimply inhuman.\u201dCouncil of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatovi\u0107 deplored the decision.\u201cRemoving the basis for almost all legal abortions in #Poland amounts to a ban & violates #HumanRights,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling of the Constitutional Court means underground/abroad abortions for those who can afford & even greater ordeal for all others. A sad day for #WomensRights.\u201dFormer European President and Poland\u2019s former prime minister, Donald Tusk, criticized the timing of such key ruling during the difficult time of the pandemic.\n\nPolice guarded the court\u2019s building as groups of pro-abortion rights and anti-abortion activists gathered outside as the verdict was announced. The groups were small, because anti-COVID-19 regulations ban gatherings of more than 10 people.One of the judges who did not back the ruling, Leon Kieres, argued he was mindful of the situation and condition of women when deprived of the right to decide about a pregnancy with defects. Polish lawmakers considered legislation earlier this year that would have imposed a near-total ban on abortion by outlawing the procedure in cases of fetal abnormalities, even when a fetus has no chance of survival. They ended up postponing a final vote on the proposal brought by a Catholic group. Similar efforts also were mothballed in the past following mass nationwide protests. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
