It\u2019s actually not that bad for gaming on as well \u2013 though you\u2019ll need to lower the resolution of games from the screen\u2019s native 4K resolution to something more manageable \u2013 as the RTX 2060 just can\u2019t handle gaming at 4K.The processors really are the stars of the show here, especially the Intel Core i9-9980HK, which makes multitasking with the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo a joy \u2013 which is just as well considering the second screen which encourages you to run multiple apps at once.During our time with the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo we were very impressed with how the laptop performed. Windows 10 felt spritely, apps opened quickly and there\u2019s no pause when you drag open apps and windows between screens.The main screen of the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo really is gorgeous (Image credit: Future)Asus ZenBook Pro Duo at Amazon for $4,999The only noticeable slowdown we encountered was on loading up a game, which by default had set itself to 4K, and meant even scrolling through the menus was a chore. Once the resolution was lowered, however, things settled down.We did struggle to run some games \u2013 hence why there\u2019s no Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark. So, while the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo could in theory be a decent gaming laptop, we\u2019d advise against buying it for the sole purpose of playing games on.As a workstation, though, the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo is an excellent performer with some very solid \u2013 and future-proof \u2013 components driving the whole thing.Unsurprisingly for a laptop with two 4K screens, battery life isn't great (Image credit: Future)Battery lifeA big, chunky laptop that\u2019s packed with powerful components and features two 4K screens was never going to have a long battery life, and in our tests that proved to be the case with the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo.In our battery life benchmark test, which involves looping a 1080p video with the screen at 50% brightness, the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo\u2019s battery lasted five hours and 11 minutes. In the PC Mark 8 benchmark, which aims to replicate moderate PC use including word processing and video calling, the battery lasted just two hours and 36 minutes.Clearly, this is a laptop that\u2019s to be used as a desktop replacement, which means you\u2019ll pretty much need it to always be plugged in to a power socket unless you\u2019re doing very light work on it.Of course, you can tweak it to eke out more battery life \u2013 for example turning off the second screen, and lowering the brightness and resolution of the main display, but it\u2019s probably something you\u2019d not want to do.While the limited battery life of the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo isn\u2019t a surprise, it\u2019s still a bit disappointing.Is it worth the money? (Image credit: Future)VerdictAsus has tried to do something different with the ZenBook Pro Duo, and while it\u2019s not an unmitigated success, we have to give the company props for giving it a go.While the build quality and high specifications of the ZenBook Pro Duo is certainly worthy of praise, its biggest selling point \u2013 the Screenpad Plus doesn\u2019t quite justify the additional price (and weight) that it adds to the laptop.There\u2019s a few nice features that comes with the second 4K screen, and with a bit of tweaking, many people may be able to set it up to work in a way that is genuinely helpful for improving productivity. For example, having an app open on the bottom screen can be really useful, and frees up space on the main screen.But is it really that useful? We\u2019d argue not. After all, the very short battery life of the\u00a0 ZenBook Pro Duo means you\u2019ll need to plugged in and sat on a desk most of the time anyway \u2013 so you might as well just plug in an external monitor for a similar experience.For less than the price that Asus is asking for with the ZenBook Pro Duo, you could by an equally powerful laptop that\u2019s a lot more svelte and portable, so you\u2019ll need to ask yourself if you\u2019re willing to make compromises for the Screenpad Plus. Many people won\u2019t.However, we hope this isn\u2019t the last we see of the Screenpad Plus. Future laptops could better integrate a second screen while keeping the size and weight of the laptop down. Apple has persisted with the Touch Bar \u2013 which was pretty much unloved when it first appeared \u2013 and we expect Asus to do the same with the Screenpad Plus.Meanwhile, we continue to wait for a genuinely disruptive new form factor for laptops. Perhaps the future lies with laptops with foldable screens. For now, though, the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo remains more of a curio than a breakthrough, but there will be a select few people who will fall in love with this unique laptop.Asus ZenBook Pro Duo: Price Comparison$4,999ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\nPerformance, battery life and verdict\n\n\n\nPrev Page Introduction, price and design\n\n\n\nMatt HansonSocial Links NavigationManaging Editor, Core Tech\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.
