(Screenshot from Indiana Right to Life)\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-life advocates have pinned their hopes on banning abortion for decades. Now that goal is within their grasp in Indiana.\u00a0\n\u201cEvery legislator down there who has had one campaign has likely taken a position on abortion,\u201d said Micah Clark, the executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana. \u201cThe kiss of death is to flip-flop on this issue.\u201d\nHe believes both an abortion ban and financial supports will pass the Indiana House and Senate with few surprises because elections loom in November for many. The special session kicks off today.\nSimilar to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a controversial bill in 2015 that made Indiana national news, Clark said the national spotlight will be on legislators in the coming weeks as they hammer out bill details.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a national target and you\u2019re going to have a lot of threats from businesses like we saw with RFRA,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a focus of attention; it\u2019s going to be a rough (few) weeks for the legislators, regardless what side they\u2019re on.\nThe introduction of Senate Bill 1 \u2014 which bans abortion from conception with a few exceptions \u2014 embodies much of what the pro-life movement has fought over for years, sharply curtailing access to reproductive healthcare for millions of Hoosiers.\nBut anti-abortion proponents argue without enough penalties for abortion providers \u2013 or requirements for prosecutors to act \u2013 the bill lacks any enforcement. The bill doesn\u2019t add any new penalties for those who perform illegal abortions but it is already a felony in Indiana.\nClark called the bill deceptive for seeming to do more than it actually does.\n\u201cIt lacks substantive teeth that would even reduce abortion much at all,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real teeth in the bill for a defiant prosecutor. And we were hoping for some criminal penalties and some power\u2026 where someone \u2013 maybe the attorney general \u2013 could enforce the law if somebody defies it.\u201d\n  Andy Downs, a political science professor at Purdue University -Fort Wayne (From Purdue University \u2013 Fort Wayne website)\nAndy Downs, a political science professor at Purdue University Fort Wayne, said he thinks the General Assembly will avoid focusing on criminal penalties, at least initially. The special session allows legislators to quickly respond to the desires of their base while appearing thoughtful and pragmatic, he said, and gives them the chance to try again in January when they return for the regular session.\n\u201cSpecial sessions are often very, very quick. Everyone has sort of come to an agreement that something needs to be done,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThere are not a whole lot of hearings or opportunities for public input like you have during a regular session.\u201d\nDowns said that the bill could arguably be a middle ground, because it includes exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, but leans to the pro-life crowd.\n\u201cIt will not be viewed as a win by people who are looking for an outright ban but it will be viewed as a win for people who are looking for tighter restrictions,\u201d Downs said. \u201cPeople who look long term when it comes to legislation will be able to consider it a win as well because it\u2019s incremental \u2013 it\u2019s a fairly large increment \u2013 but it\u2019s an incremental change from what exists right now.\u201d\nImpact of child rape on bill drafters\nThe case of a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio who sought an abortion in Indiana solidified the likelihood that the General Assembly would include a rape exception to any bill, Clark said.\u00a0\n\u201cMy position is that you don\u2019t punish the baby for the sins of the father but at the same time I do understand the circumstances,\u201d Clark said. \u201cEspecially with a 10 year old, it\u2019s a family issue. There\u2019s a lot to consider.\u201d\nHe said lawmakers shouldn\u2019t make a law based on the small numbers of people seeking abortions due to rape, something that Cathie Humbarger also believes.\n\u201cUltimately, I would like to see abortion banned completely but I do understand the political situation and we need to save as many babies as we can as soon as we can. Elective abortions makes up more than 95% of all abortions,\u201d said Humbarger, the former executive director of Allen County Right to Life. \u201cI think we can handle the hard cases (such as rape and incest) in a compassionate and caring way.\u201d\nDowns noted that anyone claiming rape or incest as a reason for pursuing an abortion under the proposed bill must sign an affidavit, which he said recognizes how lengthy the criminal process can be. But, since the documents will be confidential, it couldn\u2019t be used by prosecutors to file criminal charges.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat has been accomplished with all of that is an interesting question,\u201d Downs said.\u00a0\nClark said abortion providers should have to verify claims of rape or incest and that police reports should be filed.\n\n\u201cWe need to know who did this and it\u2019s nothing something someone should claim recklessly because they want an abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be something that the police investigate and somebody should be punished for that crime against the woman.\u201d\nThe pro-life movement\u2019s next steps\nFor Humbarger and Clark, both said more needs to be done to help women and children. The Senate introduced an accompanying bill that would earmark $50 million for such services, such as family planning and adoption support.\u00a0\n  Micah Clark, the executive director of American Family Association of Indiana (Photo from AFA-IN website)\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done. Women are still going to be in difficult situations, mothers are going to be in unplanned pregnancies and mothers are going to not know where to turn for help,\u201d Humbarger said. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do in order to make certain that each one of those women, those mothers, are loved throughout this difficult time\u2026 (and) empower women to be able to have a full life in addition to being a mother.\u201d\nClark said the pro-life movement needs to transform and focus on maternal care, in addition to adoption, and providing for the needs of children and parents.\n\u201cMaking prenatal care better funded, helping crisis pregnancy centers that help women in crisis with diapers, baby food,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good discussion to have as well and I think it\u2019s something that the pro-life movement has to shift and do more of.\u201d\nCrisis pregnancy centers recently came under fire following a New York Times article on how a group deceptively discouraged women from receiving abortions by listing themselves as providers but offering no services. The centers are frequently funded with public tax dollars but often operate as private facilities that offer limited medical services, as detailed by the Associated Press.\nWhat comes next\nClark said he doesn\u2019t think efforts to ban contraception and same-sex marriage have the same momentum as abortion and wouldn\u2019t \u201ctrickle up\u201d to the Supreme Court because of a lack of cases.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the same local battles and the same fights legally over contraception and same-sex marriage that we\u2019ve had for over 40 years with abortion,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nDowns didn\u2019t seem so sure.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that we are not done discussing social issues,\u201d Downs said.\nHe noted that no matter what happens this week, lawmakers will return in January \u2013 and every January moving forward \u2013 and will have the opportunity to introduce more anti-abortion legislation.\u00a0\n\u201cThe discussion about abortion is not over by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThis is simply the bill that the Republicans can get passed under the circumstances we have today.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIs the pro-life movement finally getting its big win?\nby Whitney Downard, Indiana Capital Chronicle July 25, 2022\nIs the pro-life movement finally getting its big win?\nby Whitney Downard, Indiana Capital Chronicle July 25, 2022\n Pro-life advocates have pinned their hopes on banning abortion for decades.
