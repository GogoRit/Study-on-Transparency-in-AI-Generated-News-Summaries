(Photo Courtesy Jayme Metzgar of The Federalist)By Rachel Blackmon BryarsAt this year\u2019s \u201cMarch For Life\u201d rally in Washington, D.C., a young woman sporting dark lipstick, a trendy cropped haircut, and Converse sneakers held up a sign that read: \u201cPro-Life Feminist: We Demand Rights For Both Mother and Child!!\u201dNext to her, another young person held a poster that read, \u201cLGBT+ Rights Begin In The Womb,\u201d according to The Federalist\u2019s Jayme Metzgar, who captured photos at the event.Do pro-life progressives exist in meaningful numbers?Are such mash-ups of controversial views common?You\u2019d hardly think so looking at the national political stage where there are only three pro-life Democrats in the U.S. House, zero pro-life Democrats running for President, and a slew of leaders pushing for late-term abortion policy positions that most Americans find extreme.Yes, pro-life progressives are rare, and becoming rarer, in political life.But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re rare in real life.\u201cI\u2019m a life-long, liberal, open-hearted Democrat who is pro-life,\u201d said Lila Kalnajs, 67, of Madison, Alabama in a phone interview. \u201cBut even for the most tolerant of tolerant, when you introduce late-term abortion, you\u2019ve taken it too far, pushing the fallacy that such an act is about women\u2019s rights. That\u2019s bull. Look at the facts and look at the science.\u201dKalnajs said both political parties need to stop judging the women involved, and examine the act itself.\u201cI don\u2019t find fault with the woman having an abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cI do find fault with the law that even allows it to be an option. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be calling so many attorneys and should be calling more doctors and scientists so they can give an opinion for this person who can\u2019t speak for themselves yet.\u201dKalnajs is far from alone in her view.Nearly 30 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Independents consider themselves \u201cpro-life,\u201d according to 2019 Gallup polling.And even though recent Marist polling released in January found that more Americans identify as pro-choice (55 percent) than pro-life (40 percent), nearly half who identify as pro-choice believe abortion should be restricted to the first three months of pregnancy.And more than six in 10 Independents and four in 10 Democrats said they are more likely to vote for a candidate who would enact that limitation.But many Democratic elected representatives and candidates still skew very far left of what so many in their own party believe.\u201cOne could argue that there is not a pro-life lane in the Democratic Party anymore,\u201d wrote John Murdock in National Affairs, pointing to the unapologetic late term abortion stance of candidates such as Elizabeth Warren and the striking announcement late last year that the Democratic Attorneys General Association (DACA) would no longer provide financial assistance to any candidate who didn\u2019t publicly support and promote abortion rights.It creates a conundrum for pro-life Democrats who are appalled by their party\u2019s extreme abortion stance.Do they stay?\u201cPeople say I should leave the Democratic Party,\u201d said Democrats For Life of America (DFLA) Executive Director Kristen Day in a recent tweet. \u201cPro-life voters leaving the Party led to the current push for abortion extremism. I am going to stay and fight. Join me in taking the Party back from the abortion lobby.\u201dOthers see abortion as the non-negotiable keeping them politically homeless.Birmingham-native Virginia Bradley Linzee is a New York City based celebrity makeup artist who told me she\u2019s a former conservative Independent who is \u201crunning away from the Republican party after Trump\u201d and considers herself \u201csuper liberal most of the time.\u201dBut where to run to?She\u2019s also the mother of a son with Down syndrome who said in a recent Belle Curve podcast interview it was challenging to see the test results at first, but that her son \u201cis a delight,\u201d and that there is \u201cnothing sad about [his condition].\u201dStill, she says she\u2019s been \u201csuper hard hit\u201d on social media when she defends her son.\u201cNice, open liberals, right?\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they are the worst.\u201dRachel Blackmon Bryars is a Huntsville-based columnist for Al.com, co-host of Belle Curve Podcast and managing partner of Bryars Communications, LLC.
