Tuesday\u2019s filings were first reported by the Washington Post.\u201cI can\u2019t stop bad things from happening to people\u2019s pregnancies,\u201d Jennifer Adkins, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Idaho, told the Post. \u201cBut I want other Idahoans to feel safe and cared for.\u201dNo OB-GYNs left in town: what came after Idaho\u2019s assault on abortionRead moreAfter the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year, states across the south and midwest enacted near-total abortion bans, many of which only allow abortions in cases of medical emergencies. However, doctors have repeatedly said that these bans, which contain non-medical language drafted by politicians, are too vague for medical providers to interpret. Instead, they are forced to wait until their patients get sick enough for them to intervene.Allie Phillips, a 28-year-old lifelong Tennesseean, was initially thrilled to find out that she and her husband would be having a baby girl. They named the future baby \u201cMiley Rose\u201d, and Phillips\u2019 five-year-old daughter laughed and clapped when she discovered she would be a big sister, Phillips told reporters on a press call on Tuesday afternoon.But, according to the lawsuit filed in Tennessee, the couple soon received devastating news: the fetus had multiple fatal diagnoses, and would never result in a healthy baby. Continuing the pregnancy would risk Phillips\u2019 health, but due to Tennessee\u2019s near-total abortion ban, Phillips could not get an abortion in her home state, the lawsuit alleges.With the help of money raised through a GoFundMe, Phillips said she traveled to New York City for an abortion.\u201cI went into surgery alone and sat in recovery alone. The doctors were kind and compassionate, but I\u2019d never met them before. I had to grieve the loss of my daughter in a city I\u2019d never been to,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cPoliticians are passing cruel laws against something they know absolutely nothing about.\u201dEarlier this summer, women gave emotional testimony for multiple days in a Texas courthouse about being denied abortions \u2013 a hearing that was believed to mark the first time since Roe that women denied abortions talked about their experiences in court. One woman spoke of slipping into sepsis and landing in the ICU, while others fled the state for abortions. One woman gave birth to an infant who lived only a few hours; during her testimony, she was so overcome that she threw up on the stand.A Texas judge in August froze the portions of the Texas ban that, the women and their lawyers said, forced doctors to deny or delay care. But Texas soon appealed the ruling and put the original law back into place. Arguments in the case are now scheduled to take place in the state\u2019s supreme court in late November.\u201cAfter we filed our case in Texas, our phones started ringing off the hook. We got calls not just from women in that state but across the country, who had similar harrowing experiences, who were turned away from hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d Nancy Northup said in the Tuesday press call. \u201cWe had hit the tip of a very large iceberg.\u201dDays of desperation: the diary of a woman forced to flee Texas for an abortion Read moreThe Idaho and Tennessee lawsuits were filed against the states. The Oklahoma case is a federal complaint, filed with the Department of Health and Human Services, against a hospital in Oklahoma on behalf of a woman with a partial molar pregnancy \u2013 which cannot develop into a viable fetus \u2013 who was reportedly told by medical providers to wait in a hospital parking lot until she got sicker, because they could not provide care until she was \u201ccrashing\u201d.Rather than trying to overturn the abortion bans entirely, the Center for Reproductive Rights is asking for clarity surrounding when abortions can be performed under their bans. The federal complaint in the Oklahoma case could result in a finding from the Department of Health and Human Services that would clarify hospitals\u2019 responsibility in handling abortion-related emergencies.\u201cToo many patients have been harmed by denial or delays in receiving the health care they needed: an abortion,\u201d Marc Hearron, senior counsel for the Center of Reproductive Rights, told reporters. \u201cWith today\u2019s filings, we are seeking to put an end to this chaos and give doctors\u2019 clarity.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionReproductive rightsOklahomaTennesseeIdahonewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
