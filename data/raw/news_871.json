MediaNews Group via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) announced Assembly Bill 1594 (AB 1594) Friday and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) spoke out in support of it at a press conference, promoting the legislation after the governor first suggested it in December and state lawmakers introduced it in January.\n\n\n\nThe bill would let anyone, including private citizens, bring civil lawsuits against \u201cgun industry members\u201d whose violations of federal, state or local gun control laws \u201c[cause] injury or death,\u201d or who have engaged in \u201cunfair business practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press notes the bill would let people sue over violations of California\u2019s assault weapons ban, or if gun dealers knowingly sell firearms to people who can\u2019t legally own them.\n\n\n\nNewsom noted Friday the bill could also help people sue over \u201cghost guns\u201d\u2014untraceable firearm kits that people can buy without a background check and assemble at home\u2014which have become a growing issue in California and have already prompted multiple local bans and lawsuits for deceptive trade practices.\n\n\nThe bill\u2019s provision allowing lawsuits copies Texas\u2019 Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), which bans nearly all abortions in the state after six weeks into a pregnancy and is enforced through private lawsuits against anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion.\n\n\nNewsom said Friday he\u2019s confident the U.S. Supreme Court, which has repeatedly declined to strike down SB 8, could not overturn AB 1594, because \u201cit is quite literally modeled after the law they just upheld in Texas.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cIf Texas can use a law to ban a woman\u2019s right to choose and to put her health at risk, we will use that same law to save lives and improve the health and safety of the people in the state of California,\u201d Newsom said Friday.\nChief Critic\nGun advocates in the state have stringently opposed AB 1594. \u201c[Newsom] can\u2019t ban guns, but he\u2019s going to try to bankrupt lawful firearms-related businesses,\u201d Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, told the AP in January.\nKey Background\nGun manufacturers and distributors are largely shielded from legal liability through the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which stipulates they can\u2019t be sued for acts of violence committed using their firearms. Bonta\u2019s office noted Friday the federal law does allow for civil lawsuits if the gun maker or dealer \u201cknowingly violates a state law regulating the sale or marketing of the product\u201d which results in direct harm to the person bringing the lawsuit, and AB 1594 \u201cwould create a clear path\u201d to bring litigation under that exception. The legislation is similar to a separate bill passed in New York last year before Texas\u2019 SB 8 took effect, which allows civil lawsuits to be brought against gun industry members if they don\u2019t have \u201creasonable controls\u201d to stop the firearms from being used or sold illegally. The AB 1594 announcement comes days after the families of victims in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School reached a $73 million settlement with gun manufacturer Remington Arms, a suit that also took advantage of an exception in the federal law.\n\nTangent\nTexas\u2019 SB 8 has let the state evade federal protections for abortion since taking effect in September, thanks to its lawsuit provision, which was designed to make it harder for those challenging the legislation to name defendants who can successfully be blocked from enforcing it. That strategy has largely proven successful in court: While one district judge initially blocked the law, his ruling was then overturned by an appeals court that put SB 8 back in place, and the Supreme Court ruled that most state officials cannot be named as defendants in a challenge brought by abortion providers. Critics of the law have repeatedly cited the fact that states could copy it for other issues as a reason not to uphold it. Gun rights groups warned the Supreme Court the law could be used as a basis for gun control laws like California\u2019s bill, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wrote in an amicus brief to the court SB 8\u2019s structure could also extend to \u201call manner of constitutional protections and civil liberties\u201d and be used for bans on critical race theory or to threaten First Amendment protections for journalists.\n\nFurther Reading\nGov.
