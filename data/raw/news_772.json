Wade\u2014including less than a third of people who live in states that already outlaw the procedure\u2014a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll finds, as more Republican-led states try to enact new abortion bans and as the midterm elections loom.\nAbortion rights demonstrators gather outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on June 24.Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe poll, conducted July 7 to 17, found 25% of the 1,847 U.S. adults polled wanted the laws in their state to ban abortion, while 61% would prefer their state guarantee abortion access.\n\n\n\nThat includes just 32% of respondents who live in states with abortion \u201ctrigger laws\u201d or pre-Roe v. Wade abortion bans still on the book, while 51% would prefer their state enacted legal protections for abortion instead.\n\n\n\nThe only demographic polled that actually supported abortion bans was Republicans, with 54% wanting their state to outlaw the procedure versus 37% who would prefer laws that guarantee access.\n\n\n\nLess than half of Republican women polled (48%) support banning the procedure, though that\u2019s still higher than the 43% of GOP women who\u2019d prefer their state protected access.\n\n\nRepublicans are more supportive of Roe v. Wade being overturned than they are of their own state banning abortion, with 71% of GOP respondents and 65% of Republican women saying they agreed with the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\nOnly 9% of Democrats and 17% of Independents support their state banning abortion, along with 22% of people in states that protect abortion rights and 19% of all women polled.\n\n\n\n\nBig Number\n33%. That\u2019s the share of all respondents who supported the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, while 65% disapproved of it. Republicans are the only demographic polled\u2014spanning party affiliation, gender and race\u2014in which a majority of respondents approved of the decision.\nTangent\nSome 17 states had trigger or pre-Roe abortion bans for the purposes of KFF\u2019s polling: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The states that protect abortion access as identified by KFF are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, plus Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nWhat impact abortion will have on the midterms, as Democratic strategists and politicians hope Americans\u2019 opposition to the Supreme Court ruling will increase voter turnout. The KFF poll, similar to other previous polls, found 55% of respondents say abortion will be \u201cvery important to their midterm vote,\u201d including 77% of Democrats, and 43% say the Supreme Court\u2019s decision has made them \u201cmore motivated\u201d to vote. That being said, abortion still ranks behind inflation when it comes to the issues that are most important to people\u2019s votes (77% said inflation was very important), and independent voters appear less swayed by abortion than Democrats. Independents rank abortion as their fourth most important political issue, the KFF poll found, and only 56% said they plan to support candidates who favor protecting abortion access. Other polling has shown Americans\u2019 anger over abortion may not translate to the ballot box, with respondents who support the ruling indicating they\u2019re more likely to vote than Americans who disapprove of it\u2014possibly because they feel politicians aren\u2019t doing enough to address the issue.\nKey Background\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, leading to a wave of state-level abortion bans, with even more poised to soon pass. The West Virginia legislature is now considering passing an abortion ban after the state\u2019s 19th century-era ban was blocked in court, and the Indiana Senate passed a bill on Saturday that could make the state the first to enact a new abortion ban in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe. What abortion bans should look like in the wake of Roe\u2019s overturning is an increasingly fraught issue, however. While anti-abortion advocates have pushed for harsh abortion bans that don\u2019t contain exemptions for rape or incest, KFF\u2019s poll is in line with other polling showing Americans are broadly supportive of abortion rights and do not want total abortion bans without those exemptions. As a result, both Indiana and West Virginia\u2019s proposed bills contain exemptions for rape and incest\u2014angering both sides of the debate, as abortion rights advocates believe the bills go too far and anti-abortion advocates believe they don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nFurther Reading\nMost Americans In States Banning Abortion Disapprove Of Roe V.
