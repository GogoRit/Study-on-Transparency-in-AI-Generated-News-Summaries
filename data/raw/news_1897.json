Angela Major/WPR \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a freezing day in mid-March, dozens of activists stood among snow piles in downtown Appleton, their focus on rights they said are at stake in Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal State Supreme Court election. \nThey talked about the state\u2019s legislative maps, voting rights and safety for the LGBTQ community. But at the core of almost all of their remarks, one issue stood out: the future of abortion rights in Wisconsin.\nAdriel Denae of Appleton sings a song at a rally in favor of abortion access Saturday, March 11, 2023, in Appleton, Wis. She sang the lyrics, \u201cone foot in front of the other, and lead with love.\u201d\u00a0Angela Major/WPR\n\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nCommentsThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a 26-year-old woman living in Wisconsin, I want to have autonomy over my body,\u201d said Emma Kiel of Appleton. \u201cI\u2019m young, and I\u2019m still going to be figuring out what I want to do with my life and whether or not I want to bring children into that. And it\u2019s really terrifying that somebody else can make that choice for me.\u201d\nAbortion has long been an issue in Wisconsin elections, but it\u2019s arguably on the ballot in this year\u2019s state Supreme Court race. \nThat\u2019s largely because the procedure has been outlawed here since last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, reinstating Wisconsin\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion ban in the process. A lawsuit that would repeal that ban and restore abortion rights is pending in state court and almost certain to end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, whose ideological balance is up for grabs in this election.\nIn an ostensibly nonpartisan race, former Justice Dan Kelly is favored by conservatives, and has done work for an anti-abortion group. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Janet Protasiewicz, who\u2019s backed by liberals, has been outspoken in her support for abortion rights. If Protasiewicz wins, liberals would hold a majority on the court for the first time since 2008. \nAbortion rights supporters see that as an opportunity to overturn Wisconsin\u2019s ban on abortion, and that awareness is transforming what might otherwise be a low-key election. It\u2019s shattering records for campaign spending, attracting national attention, and motivating the people at this Appleton gathering.\n\u201cThis is new for me,\u201d said Whitney Bouchard, of Kaukauna, as she waved a sign at passing drivers, some of whom honked in support. \u201cI think I just realized how much of an impact these things have. And I don\u2019t think everybody does. You hear about the presidential elections \u2026 and those are important, but I don\u2019t think people realize how important all the other elections are.\u201d\nUS Supreme Court set the stage for Wisconsin\u2019s high-stakes court race\nWisconsin is not the only state where abortion access changed after the repeal of Roe v. Wade, but the transformation here was especially pronounced.\nBefore the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health ruling that overturned Roe, Wisconsin prohibited abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. After the ruling, an outright ban on abortion, first written in 1849 and amended years later, became the law of the land.\nAfter that, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit arguing that more recent Wisconsin statutes, many from 1985, conflict with the original ban. The suit also argues that the ban is unenforceable because it went unused for so long.\nThat challenge is still pending in Dane County Circuit Court, but it\u2019s expected to go before the Supreme Court, where the ideological makeup of the court could be the deciding factor in how it\u2019s resolved.\nThis sets the stage for other state-level races, said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian and expert on the U.S. abortion debate at the University of California, Davis School of Law. \nSupporters of abortion access hold signs at a rally Saturday, March 11, 2023, in Appleton, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much more interest in state supreme courts across the country than there\u2019s ever been,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Wisconsin is going to be kind of like a laboratory for both sides as they try to figure out how to influence State Supreme Court elections.\u201d\nThese campaigns reflect a political change since the fall of Roe, Ziegler said. Abortion was not a leading issue for most voters before last summer, but people across the political spectrum have been motivated by the loss of access to a procedure that had been protected by the U.S. Supreme Court for decades.\nWhile Democrats are most obviously motivated by the issue, Ziegler said some Republicans also want to see more moderate abortion laws than their states offer in a post-Roe world. That includes Wisconsin, where the ban that went into effect does not include exceptions for pregnancies that occur because of rape or incest.\n\u201cYou also have seen a shift in intensity of preference on abortion among a lot of Democrats \u2014 and, I think, some questions among some Republicans, especially around laws like Wisconsin\u2019s, that don\u2019t have exceptions,\u201d she said.\nA group of GOP lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, proposed a bill that would add those exceptions to state law. It met bipartisan opposition, as Democrats complained it didn\u2019t go far enough to restore abortion rights, and anti-abortion groups promised to fight the bill and preserve the outright ban.\nProtasiewicz, Kelly take dramatically different approaches\nWhen it comes to the candidates themselves, Protasiewicz and Kelly have taken dramatically different approaches to the abortion issue during this campaign.\nJudge Janet Protasiewicz answers a question during a debate with opponent Justice Dan Kelly on Tuesday, March 21, 2023, at the State Bar Center in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nProtasiewicz has repeatedly said that she supports access to abortion. But she\u2019s also said that that is a statement of her values, and not an indication of how she would decide any given case.\n\u201cI can\u2019t make any specific comments as to what I would do when elected as a Supreme Court justice,\u201d she said on WPR\u2019s \u201cCentral Time\u201d program last month. \u201cWhat I have told people regarding the 1849 (ban): I have been very, very clear that my values are that women have the right to choose.\u201d\nProtasiewicz added that her decisions will be based in Constitutional law and not \u201cright-wing partisan beliefs.\u201d\nAnd at a debate between the two candidates on Tuesday \u2014 the only debate of the campaign \u2014 she asserted that Kelly will uphold the existing ban.\n\u201cI have been very clear about my values to the electorate, because I think the electorate deserves to know what a person\u2019s values are, rather than hiding them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100 percent certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books.\u201d\nKelly has said that Protasiewicz\u2019s statements amount to a pledge to rule a certain way, and he denied that he has made up his mind about the abortion ban.\nJustice Dan Kelly answers a question during a debate with opponent Judge Janet Protasiewicz on Tuesday, March 21, 2023, at the State Bar Center in Madison, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\n\u201cThis seems to be a pattern for you, Janet. Just telling lies. So you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking about that abortion ban. You have no idea,\u201d he said at the debate\nHe also said that his endorsements from anti-abortion groups were not contingent on promises to decide to uphold the ban.\n\u201cI had no conversations with those organizations about how I would rule on any issue, including the abortion issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand what the court is supposed to do, and that\u2019s resolving legal questions. So those endorsements had nothing to do with the pledges that are required of those who run for political office.\u201d\nWith all eyes on Wisconsin, campaign spending shatters records\nThe stakes are obvious by the size of spending in the race, which has already shattered national records for a state high court race. Weeks ago, the data firm AdImpact estimated that more than $22 million has been spent on ads in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race. The previous record was $15 million, set in Illinois in 2004, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nThe largest single spender has been the Protasiewicz campaign, but outside groups that support Republicans have recently become more involved, spending millions on Kelly\u2019s behalf. \nThat record spending reflects the increasing importance of state court races to issues like abortion access, said Douglas Keith, an attorney with the Brennan Center. \n\u201cIf you are a group who cared about abortion access, before Dobbs, nationally, as an issue that you worked on \u2014 either for or against \u2014 there\u2019s a recognition that some of the most important deciders when it comes to an issue like that are now going to be state high courts,\u201d he said. \nNational groups have jumped into Wisconsin\u2019s race, throwing their organizing weight behind respective candidates. Protasiewicz has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood and Emily\u2019s List, a national group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights. According to Emily\u2019s List, Protasiewicz is the first state judicial candidate ever endorsed by the organization. \nKelly has been endorsed by three Wisconsin anti-abortion groups: Pro-Life Wisconsin, Wisconsin Family Action and Wisconsin Right to Life, a group for which he provided legal counsel in the past. The national anti-abortion group, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life, has also supported his campaign.\nOrganizers are treating Wisconsin like a test case. The national Women\u2019s March held a rally at the Wisconsin State Capitol in January to draw attention to the race.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court election is really an opportunity to see what is possible,\u201d Women\u2019s March managing director Tamika Middleton said in January. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible to influence and impact a Supreme Court in a state and overturn a ban in that state, that gives us a model, an opportunity to think about what we can do in other states.\u201d\nA new urgency to an old debate\nPolitical activists say they\u2019re seeing an unprecedented level of excitement around this race. Steven Webb, the director of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said the organization is seeing \u201crecord\u201d numbers of young people coming out to organize for the election.\n\u201cThey really understand what is at stake, and they want their voice heard this election,\u201d he said.\nA celebration outside the Supreme Court, Friday, June 24, 2022, in Washington. The Supreme Court has ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years \u2014 a decision by its conservative majority to overturn the court\u2019s landmark abortion cases. Steve Helber/AP Photo\nAnti-abortion activists are also looking to preserve the legal victory they achieved when Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer. Gracie Skogman, the legislative director of Wisconsin Right to Life, said she\u2019s \u201cnever seen\u201d a response like this from anti-abortion activists.\n\u201cThis is the most impactful election for the pro-life base here in Wisconsin, now that there is a tangible law that\u2019s on the line,\u201d she said. \nHer organization, and other anti-abortion groups, are texting and calling voters and sending out mailers. Skogman said these activists are motivated not just by politics but by the personal experiences of working with women who carried pregnancies to term that they might otherwise have terminated. \n\u201cThis is personal to them,\u201d she said of the volunteers working with her group to get out the vote for Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine something more motivational than that.\u201d\nAmong abortion rights activists, there\u2019s a different kind of urgency. Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said people are energized by the loss of a right they may have taken for granted. The state party has drawn national attention to Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race and transferred millions to the Protasiewicz campaign.\nWikler said Democrats are also motivated by a sense of hope that they can push affirmatively for changes to the state\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion law. Last year, Wikler said, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers campaigned on preserving the power of his veto to block legislation \u2014 of being a \u201cgoalie.\u201d This campaign, Wikler said, is different.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that we can prevent something terrible from happening,\u201d said Wikler. \u201cIn this moment, we can actually move to the other side of the field.\u201d\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nRepublican DA asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide abortion lawsuit without lower court ruling \n\n \n\n\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court overturns Republican-drawn legislative maps \n\n \n\n\n\nSheboygan County DA to appeal ruling that abortions are legal to Wisconsin Supreme Court \n\n \n\n\n\nFormer Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel enters 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court Race \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
