Money and support have been streamlined to frontline emergency services. This has meant that some facilities, such as sexual and reproductive clinics have been working with skeleton staff or have closed down altogether. However, the National Women\u2019s Health Network, in coalition with other organizations, has urged the FDA to make the abortion pill available for people to access where they\u2019ll be having the abortion\u2014at home. The global pandemic doesn\u2019t change the fact that people will need access to medical abortions.\n\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Health Network worked alongside 80 organizations to write an open letter to the U.S Food and Drug Administration urging it to lift unnecessary medical restrictions so people could access the two pills needed to induce an abortion at home. Abortion Care Network, Human Rights Watch and Women\u2019s Health Specialists were among some of the organizations that signed the letter. Cynthia A. Pearson, Executive Director of the National Women\u2019s Health Network said, \u201cthese restrictions have never made medical sense, but now they risk making a global pandemic worse. In the midst of strict state stay-at-home orders, the FDA is requiring women and providers to leave their homes and travel long distances just to hand off a pill that could be mailed to their doorsteps or available at local pharmacies.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the FDA requires that you have to pick up mifepristone in person from your clinician, clinic or hospital but you can wait to take it until you get home. This means people have to leave their houses to make, what can be a long journey, endangering themselves and the people around them. The early medical abortion always occurs at home, not it a medical setting. The letter reads, \u201cthese requirements have long harmed patients\u2019 health by delaying or blocking access to medication abortion with no countervailing medical benefit. Now, in the midst of a public health emergency, these requirements are further endangering patients and straining the health system.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt continues, \u201csolid research and nearly 20 years of clinical experience have demonstrated that these requirements are medically unnecessary...The FDA is putting the lives of pregnant people at risk. We urge you to take steps now to ensure that mifepristone remains a safe and effective form of abortion care during the crisis.\u201d\n\nIn the UK the Department of Health confirmed that people needing an early medical abortion can take both pills at home, rather than travelling to a clinic to take the second pill. Speaking about the change Claire Murphy, the director of external affairs at British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), said, \u201cthis is a very safe and simple measure that will dramatically improve women\u2019s access to care at this time of national crisis. We\u2019re really pleased that the government has acted on this. It will make a huge difference to women\u2019s health and wellbeing in the current climate.\u201d\nMORE FOR YOU 300 Billion Crypto Price Crash Suddenly Accelerates As Bitcoin  Ethereum And XRP Traders Brace For A Fed ShockApple\u2019s Surprise Update Just Made iPhone More Like SamsungNew Gmail Security Rules You Have 14 Days To Comply  Google Says\n\n\nResearch has found that even in times and places where abortion isn\u2019t accessible, they still happen. However, the risk to the person undergoing the procedure is so much higher. According to the World Health Organisation providing women across the globe with access to safe and legal abortion services is essential to realizing and protecting their fundamental human rights.\n\nIn the letter the National Women\u2019s Health Network and their co-signatories state \u201cfor many of these people, access to safe and effective mifepristone could be a lifeline, ensuring they receive prompt abortion care without having to visit a clinic, or even leave their homes.\u201d Countries around the world have changed their abortion procedures in line with the CVOID-19 pandemic. The NWHN is urging the FDA to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nFull coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website\u00a0or\u00a0some of my other work\u00a0here.\u00a0Alice BrosterEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"
