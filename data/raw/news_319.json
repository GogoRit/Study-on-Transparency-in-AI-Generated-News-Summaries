But, as has been shown by the group\u2019s own figures, it doesn\u2019t provide those clients with very many actual health-care services. According to the report, the only significant services offered, besides abortion, are STI and HIV tests, contraception, and pregnancy tests.Last year, it provided only 235,000 well-woman exams and 32,000 \u201cfamily practice services,\u201d despite executives\u2019 repeated claims that the group is an average health-care provider offering a vast selection of regular health-care services.For the Governor of Michigan to believe that \u201cPlanned Parenthood Makes America Great\u201d with verbiage in her tweet that states \u201cThe future is bright.... and pink!\u201d is all you need to know about her and what is behind many of her actions\u00a0today.The Live with Renk show airs Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to\u00a0noon, to let me know your thoughts call (269) 441-9595ALSO SEE: 30 Most Decade-Defining MemesFiled Under: gretchen whitmer, planned parenthoodCategories: Michigan, Opinion, PoliticsCommentsLeave A CommentMore From WBCKFMPaw Paw Man Charged in Kalamazoo Planned Parenthood ArsonPaw Paw Man Charged in Kalamazoo Planned Parenthood ArsonAP Swoops In And Uses The Woman Shield To Protect Michigan Governor WhitmerAP Swoops In And Uses The Woman Shield To Protect Michigan Governor WhitmerWhile Michigan Burned Governor Whitmer Partied And Fiddled In California Inhaling Gobs Of CashWhile Michigan Burned Governor Whitmer Partied And Fiddled In California Inhaling Gobs Of CashDid The Whitmer Administration Underreport Long-term Care Facilities Deaths?\u00a0 Michigan Auditor General Said YesDid The Whitmer Administration Underreport Long-term Care Facilities Deaths?\u00a0 Michigan Auditor General Said YesDoes Michigan Gov.
