And for those who support abortion access, the decision is widely viewed as what Melissa Murray, an expert in constitutional law and professor at New York University, dubbed a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d \u2014 one planted by Chief Justice John Roberts.A Tale of Twin Laws The court\u2019s 5-4 decision to strike down Louisiana\u2019s law in June Medical Services v. Russo rested on a few key factors. But the overriding problem for Louisiana, according to the majority, was this: the law, and its impacts, were nearly identical to a case the court had decided only four years ago.In the 2016 case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, the court had struck down a Texas law that was a near duplicate of Louisiana\u2019s \u2014 indeed, Texas\u2019s H.B. 2 had been the blueprint for Louisiana\u2019s Act 620. By the time lawmakers in Baton Rouge took notice in 2014, Texas\u2019s law had already shut down half of that state\u2019s abortion clinics.Both laws were created expressly to protect women\u2019s health by requiring doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. After Texas\u2019s law was struck down as unconstitutional \u2014 based on the fact it provided no medical benefit but severely restricted access to abortion \u2014 Louisiana did not give up the fight.A year later, a district court ruled Louisiana\u2019s law unconstitutional, but by then President Donald Trump had appointed one justice to the Supreme Court. Speculation simmered that he would get another, and in the summer of 2018, his biggest opportunity arrived with Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s resignation. Kennedy had provided the swing vote in the Texas case. The thinking was that replacing him with an anti-abortion justice, Brett Kavanaugh, would give conservatives the five votes they needed to dramatically curtail abortion rights.That calculation has turned out to be wrong, thanks to Chief Justice Roberts.The Trojan Horse For Abortion AdvocatesOn its face, Louisiana lost in a major way in June Medical. All of the court\u2019s four liberal justices and the conservative chief justice sided with the district court\u2019s findings that Louisiana\u2019s law would shutter two of the state\u2019s three abortion clinics without providing any credentialing function for doctors or improving the health outcomes for abortion patients.Some, including the abortion-rights-leaning editorial board of the New York Times, slammed Solicitor General Liz Murrill in particular for having \u201cbungled the job\u201d during oral arguments and providing answers so \u201cinept\u201d they left the chief justice without much cover to uphold Louisiana\u2019s law, even if had wanted to. That viewpoint was rejected by Louisiana anti-abortion advocates, who praised Murrill\u2019s performance.But Murray said Roberts has significantly watered down the Texas decision in the process and provided an opening for states to enact restrictive laws that serve to reduce abortion access.Before Texas\u2019s Whole Woman\u2019s Health case, courts relied on a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which instructed judges to consider if abortion laws present a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d to a person\u2019s ability to access an abortion.In the Texas decision, the Supreme Court said that the way to establish if a burden was substantial was to look at the facts and weigh a law\u2019s benefits against its burdens. Abortion-rights groups saw this as a significant strengthening of the review process because it forced states to prove that laws they enacted in the name of health and safety actually served that purpose.In June Medical, Roberts has gutted that weighing of benefits and burdens. Instead, he wrote, one only need look at the overall obstacle to abortion.\u201cHe's essentially saying that when it comes to a reviewing court, whether a district court or a circuit court, you can make findings of fact but you have to take the legislature at their word,\u201d Murray said.Ellie Schilling, a lawyer and board member of reproductive rights nonprofit Lift Louisiana, said that will \u201clead to more litigation overall.\u201cI think it easily could lead to more restrictions,\u201d she added.Murray said Roberts has followed a pattern in past abortion rulings from the Supreme Court \u2014\u00a0where one decision shores up the right to abortion, only to have it diminished in a subsequent ruling.\u201cIt's like a Potemkin village in the same way that Casey says it upholds Roe, but totally eviscerates all of the protections that Roe provided,\u201d Murray said.Indeed, Roberts went out of his way in his decision to point out that in Casey, the Supreme Court only invalided one anti-abortion law in Pennsylvania, but upheld a handful of others.\u201cAnd it's not a surprise, but after Casey, what we saw was a spate of ever more restrictive abortion restrictions, even as Casey said it was preserving Roe,\u201d Murray explained. \u201cIt basically made it easier for legislatures to legislate Roe out of existence. So it's kind of death by 1,000 cuts.\u201dThe Anti-Abortion Silver Lining The piling on of anti-abortion laws has been particularly pronounced of late. More than 33 separate states have enacted a combined 479 abortion restrictions from 2011 to 2019, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights nonprofit. That\u2019s more than a third in a single decade of all restrictions passed since 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided.A major focus of states with predominate anti-abortion politics has been to attack abortion through a range of laws that don\u2019t seek to ban it, but can make it harder both to access and to operate as an abortion provider. Legislatures typically say these laws, such as the admitting privileges law, support women\u2019s health and safety.The anti-abortion movement is by no means thanking the Chief Justice this week. The Judicial Crisis Network, Susan B. Anthony List, Americans United for Life and other prominent anti-abortion groups slammed the chief justice, accusing him of playing politics on the bench and siding with liberal justices who would \u201crather be doctors than judges,\u201d as Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network, put it.Steven Aden, who is now the chief legal officer and general counsel with Americans United for Life, was part of the trial team that originally argued Louisiana\u2019s case in the district court \u2014 the trial that provided the evidence the Supreme Court used to strike down Louisiana\u2019s law. Aden did not mince words about Roberts.\u201cHe is weak. He is not a leader. He doesn't broker strong consensus,\u201d Aden said. He called Roberts\u2019s legal views \u201cso idiosyncratic, that nobody can understand them. He's twisted himself into knots on this, and many other cases, to come up with views that only he holds.\u201dBut he did see the silver lining.\u201cWe have now a majority of the court that would apply a stringent Planned Parenthood v. Casey undue burden standard, and that is a good thing for state lawmakers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hopefully will provide some clarity going forward, especially when legislating in the areas of health and safety.\u201dThe only thing this case settled, he said, \u201cis that Act 620 is unconstitutional.\u201dAnd while abortion-rights groups see the ruling as burying the issue of admitting privileges laws, Aden disagrees. Roberts' opinion said the laws should be decided on a case by case basis, he noted. He also views standing \u2014 the question of whether abortion providers have the right to sue on behalf of their patient\u2019s right to abortion \u2014 as up in the air.How Other Abortion Precedents Could FallBeyond the particularities of this one case, Roberts\u2019s vote \u201csettled nothing,\u201d Aden said. \u201cIn fact, it was calculated to settle nothing.\u201dWhy? According to Aden, so the chief justice could leave the door open not just to laws that might stand up under Casey, but to that 1992 abortion precedent itself.\u201cDo I read in the chief justice's opinion intonation that he would consider an attack on Casey? The answer is, yes.\u201dAden noted that Roberts described a certain paragraph of that decision \u2014 in which the court describes abortion cases as a question of balancing the state\u2019s interest in protecting life and an individual\u2019s interest in defining it for themselves\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as presenting \u201cimponderable values\u201d that defy objectivity with \u201cno meaningful way to compare them.\u201d\u201cIt's an impossible task,\u201d Aden said. \u201cAnd so I find in that paragraph a sarcastic criticism of the central holding of Casey, if you will, and others do too.\u201d\u201cI don't know what that means down the road,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cit seems like the chief justice regards it as bad philosophy, and probably bad judicial philosophy.\u201dFor Murray, the decision underlines that Trump has not yet created a Supreme Court ready to overturn Roe v. Wade. Not yet.\u201cI think if they got another justice and they had a six-three majority, they easily would do it,\u201d Murray said.It\u2019s clear to Murray that Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2014 the dissenters in this case \u2014 \u201care ready to overrule Roe.\u201d\u201cI think the chief justice is the one who's sort of being more cagey, because he understands that there's political pressure that there will likely be a backlash, that it will seem like the court is mired in partisan politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he would like a more robust majority before actually taking that step.\u201d\u201cBut when the opportunity presents itself, will they all act in concert?\u201d she added. \u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNews\nAbortionAbortion Restrictionsu.s. supreme courtJune Medical Services v.
