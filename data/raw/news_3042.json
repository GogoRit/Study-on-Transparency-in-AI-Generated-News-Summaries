This time, they\u2019re using Jesus\u2019 Incarnation to try to argue for abortion:\nMary had a baby \u2014 by choice, not by force.\nIn her story is the pro-choice root of all Christianity:\n\u2013 the freedom to decide\n\u2013 the power to freely say \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u2013 the agency to fully say \u201cYes!\u201d\nOther similar groups have latched on to this argument. \u201cCatholics for Choice\u201d (a similar group, but targeting Catholics) used the feast of the Immaculate Conception to say, \u201cMary\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 embodies the power of reproductive choice. We work for the same freedom for all women, trans, and nonbinary people.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to simply get mad about this kind of thing. Understandably: taking the Virgin Mary and Jesus, and turning them into poster children for an action Pope St. John Paul II rightly denounced as \u201ca crime which cannot be morally justified by any circumstance, purpose or law,\u201d is quite literally blasphemy. As the Catechism points out, it is \u201cblasphemous to make use of God\u2019s name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put them to death,\u201d and Faith Choice Ohio and Catholics for Choice are defending the killing of babies in the name of the child Jesus.\nBut I think it\u2019s worth addressing this argument on its merits, partially because the people making the claim insist that they\u2019re arguing in good faith. Faith Choice Ohio\u2019s Kelley Fox defends the \u201cMary had a baby (by choice)\u201d slogan by saying:\nFor some people, this shirt is offensive and goes against their theology. But for me, thinking about the story behind this shirt makes me see the absolute beauty in consent.\nIn the very first chapter of Luke, Mary is told about the future God has planned for her and is able to say YES for herself: \u201cLet it be with me just as you have said.\u201d (Luke 1: 38)\nWhen thinking about consent and how Mary was able to decide whether she wanted to serve as the mother of Christ, I find that this moment makes the birth of Jesus even more special. Consider the contrary, what if she had said NO and God used her anyway? Or what if God didn\u2019t ask at all? Doesn\u2019t that kind of sully the whole story?\nSo what can we say about this idea? Strange as it may sound, there are two important points being made here that are worth highlighting.\nFirst, many falsehoods\u00a0contain a half-truth that make them sound plausible, and this one qualifies. The truth is, Fox and others are right to see in the story of the Annunciation a beautiful witness of Mary\u2019s free cooperation in the plan of God. Through the New Testament witness, God thinks it\u2019s important that we know that Mary freely participated in the plan of salvation.\nI\u2019ve heard certain Protestants say bizarre things like \u201cMary was just a vessel, chosen to house the Lord our God.\u201d From a religious perspective, this is ridiculous, like saying that the Ark of the Covenant was \u201cjust a box,\u201d or that the Holy of Holies was \u201cjust a room.\u201d But it\u2019s absurd even from a merely human perspective: try telling your mom next Mother\u2019s Day that she was \u201cjust a vessel\u201d to house you until you were born.\nMotherhood is so much more than that, whether we mean Mary\u2019s or any mother\u2019s. St. Luke tells us that Jesus \u201cwas obedient to\u201d Mary and Joseph and that as a child, he \u201cincreased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and man\u201d (Luke 2:51-52). Mary and Joseph weren\u2019t just stand-ins; they actually had to parent the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. And Mary has this unique role, in that she offers her own body for the Incarnation. In John 6:51, Jesus says, \u201cI am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.\u201d That flesh, through which he saved the world, is the body that he received from his mother\u2019s free yes to God\u2019s plan.\nMary\u2019s yes tells us something beautiful about Mary, and also something beautiful about God. As St. Augustine points out, God will save us only with our consent:\nBut God made you without you. You didn\u2019t, after all, give any consent to God making you. How were you to consent, if you didn\u2019t yet exist? So while he made you without you, he doesn\u2019t justify you without you. So he made you without your knowing it, he justifies you with your willing consent to it.\nSo consent really is of great importance, both in terms of our salvation and in all other areas. This is particularly true in the realm of human sexuality. The Catechism points this out in the context of marriage: \u201cThe Church holds the exchange of consent between the spouses to be the indispensable element that \u2018makes the marriage.\u2019 If consent is lacking there is no marriage.\u201d Marriage\u2014which is intimately tied up with sexuality\u2014requires consent, or there\u2019s no marriage. That says something about how important consent is. And on the other hand, to forcibly engage in any kind of sexual intimacy with someone without consent is rape, a sin (and crime) that the Catechism decries in strong language.\nCertainly, there\u2019s more to Christian sexual ethics than just consent. But there\u2019s not less. If we don\u2019t take the trouble to stress what might seem obvious to us\u2014that consent matters, and that God shows us a model of taking consent seriously in how he deals with his people\u2014then we\u2019ll have ourselves to blame if we\u2019re mischaracterized as viewing all women as simply \u201cvessels.\u201d\nBut \u201cCatholics for Choice\u201d gives the game away in saying that \u201cMary\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 embodies the power of reproductive choice.\u201d Because when does Mary\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d come? At the Annunciation . . . before she\u2019s pregnant.\nAnother way of saying that is that true reproductive choice means saying yes to reproduction. And what is reproduction? Biologically, \u201cthe term reproduction is used to signify the production of a new individual organism.\u201d That\u2019s from the textbook Molecular Biology. Other biology texts say something similar. For instance, in The Biology of Reproduction, Fusco and Minelli explain that \u201cin biology, reproduction is often defined as the process by which new individuals are produced from pre-existing individuals.\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve got a unique organism, reproduction has occurred. This is true of any living thing, whether we\u2019re talking about a single-celled organism or a human being. The major difference is how that reproduction takes place. Unlike lower organisms, humans and animals reproduce sexually. All of this is simply another way of saying that when you, as a creature who reproduces sexually, consent to sexual intercourse, you\u2019re consenting to the possibility of reproduction.\nTo say that you consent to sex without consenting to pregnancy is like saying you consent to eating a cinnamon roll without consenting to the calories. It doesn\u2019t work like that. Biologically, eating exists to provide the body with calories and nutrients, and sex exists to allow for reproduction. That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t have other motives for eating, or for having sex. But it does mean that we\u2019re deluding ourselves if we imagine that we can cut these activities off from their biological realities.\nThis distinction\u2014between potential motherhood before conception, and motherhood after\u2014is clear from Scripture as well as from science. The angel Gabriel had foretold that John the Baptist would \u201cbe filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother\u2019s womb\u201d (Luke 1:15), and this prophecy is fulfilled in the Visitation. When \u201cElizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb\u201d (v. 41), and she cries out, \u201cAnd why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy\u201d (vv. 43-44).\nFox, Faith Choice Ohio, and Catholics for Choice claim to be motivated by religious faith. If that\u2019s true, they should be chastened to read this account: the unborn John the Baptist is in the early part of the third trimester, and he is (a) alive, (b) considered a person by Scripture, (c) filled with the Holy Spirit, and (d) leaping for joy to be in the presence of . . . the unborn Jesus Christ, who has been in his mother\u2019s womb for less than a month. There\u2019s no way to read this and say \u201cunborn babies aren\u2019t people,\u201d since the New Testament treats them as such in both the first and third trimester of pregnancy.\nAt the Annunciation, Mary is not yet a mother: she\u2019s free to say yes or no to motherhood. But at the Visitation, she already is a mother, because she\u2019s pregnant\u2014hence Elizabeth\u2019s description of her as \u201cthe mother of my Lord,\u201d not \u201cthe potential mother of my Lord.\u201d At this point, she can no more say \u201cno\u201d to motherhood than she could say \u201cno\u201d to motherhood once Jesus is five years old.\nI don\u2019t just mean that morally, although that\u2019s certainly true. I also mean logically: nothing that happens now\u2014even the death of her Son\u2014will change her status as a mother, the Mother of God. The same is true with abortion. It doesn\u2019t make you not a mother; it makes you the mother of a dead child.\nSo by all means, we can agree with Faith Choice Ohio that the story of Christ\u2019s conception and birth is a story of God respecting \u201creproductive choice.\u201d God wants his people to have the free ability to say \u201cno\u201d to the decision to reproduce, and indeed, in same cases, we\u2019re morally required to say no (for instance, when we\u2019re unmarried). But the Christmas story isn\u2019t a story that justifies \u201creproductive choice\u201d as a euphemism for killing a child who has already been conceived. And it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say it\u2019s blasphemous to pretend it is.\nMoralityDid you like this content?
