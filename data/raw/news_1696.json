(Photo by Andrew VonBank)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\tThe DFL\u2019s top priority hit the House Floor Thursday.\n\r\n\tAnd after a little less than four hours of debate, HF1, was passed 69-65 and is headed to the Senate.\n\r\n\tReferred to as the \u201cProtect Reproductive Options Act,\u201d the bill would further establish in state law the fundamental right for an individual to make decisions on their own reproductive health.\n\r\n\t\u201cI know that not every positive pregnancy test is a celebration and not every ultrasound appointment ends with good news. And I, as a politician, have no business making that decision for someone else,\u201d said Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn (DFL-Eden Prairie), the bill sponsor.Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn presents HF1, a bill that would codify abortion rights, on the House Floor Jan. 19. (Photo by Andrew VonBank)\n\r\n\tBeyond abortion, the proposed legislation seeks to protect sterilization, family planning, preconception and maternity care, fertility services and counseling related to reproductive health care.\n\r\n\tFurthermore, the bill would bar local governments from imposing any restrictive regulations.\n\r\n\tAfter Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, DFLers campaigned heavily on wanting to codify the right to an abortion.\n\r\n\tAbortion is legal in Minnesota due to Doe v. Gomez. In the 1995 case, the Minnesota Supreme Court decided the right to terminate a pregnancy is protected by the right of privacy in the state\u2019s constitution.\n\r\n\t\u201cSince the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the United States is a patchwork of abortion access and Minnesota is an island in providing this health care,\u201d Kotyza-Witthuhn said.\n\nRep. Athena Hollins (DFL-St. Paul) recounted her own abortion while speaking in support of the bill. \u201cIt was my decision. It was my body. And it was my future.\u201dRep. Harry Niska speaks to an amendment offered to HF1, a bill that would codify abortion rights, on the House Floor Jan. 19. The amendment was ultimately withdrawn. (Photo by Andrew VonBank)\n\r\n\tShe hid her experience from the world, worried her experiences were not extreme enough to justify her experience but wants to destigmatize abortion.\n\r\n\tRepublicans mostly voiced strong opposition to the bill.\n\r\n\t\u201cThis is a very extreme bill, the most extreme abortion bill in the U.S.,\u201d said Rep. Jim Nash (R-Waconia).\n\nRep. Mary Franson (R-Alexandria) said the bill is about \u201cabortion on demand\u201d and urged legislators to consider the unborn baby when voting.\n\r\n\t\u201cIt is infanticide. I ask you to allow those babies to have a great start in Minnesota and that great start starts in the womb,\u201d she said.\n\r\n\tAmendments requiring licensure of abortion facilities and banning third trimester abortions were among those failing to garner enough votes and were not adopted.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles \n\n\n\n\nMarch 18, 2024\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n\nBill aims to fill rural Minnesota\u2019s shortage of mental health professionals \n\n\nMarch 14, 2024\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n\nHouse health panel approves proposal to provide medical debt relief\n\n\nMarch 14, 2024\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n\nOverdrawn food banks in line for cash infusion \n\n\nMarch 13, 2024\nMarch 13, 2024\n\n\nPrisoners could opt out of court-ordered treatment programs with religious aspects\n\n\nMarch 13, 2024\nMarch 13, 2024\n\n\nPharmacies would continue vaccinating against flu, COVID-19 under proposal in House\n\n\nMarch 11, 2024\nMarch 11, 2024\n\n\nBill would require sober houses to have supply of opiate antagonists\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n\nLawmakers aim to tap Medicaid for novel nutrition, prisoner health care programs\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n\nTo earn or not to earn: House health committee debates HMOs in Minnesota\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n\nProposal would raise \u2018age of delinquency\u2019 by three years\n\n\nMarch 6, 2024\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n\nBill to mandate abortion coverage by health care plans clears commerce panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession Daily Home\n\nSearch Session Daily\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search Options\n\n\n\n\nPriority Dailies\n\n\nMinnesota\u2019s projected budget surplus balloons to $3.7 billion, but fiscal pressure still looms\nBy Rob Hubbard\n\n\r\n\tJust as Minnesota has experienced a warmer winter than usual, so has the state\u2019s budget outlook warmed over the past few months.\r\n\r\n\tOn Thursday, Minnesota Management and Budget...\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\n\n\n\nLegislative leaders announce 2024 committee deadlines\nBy HPIS Staff\n\n\r\n\tLegislators and the public officially know the timeline for getting bills through the House committee process during the upcoming 2024 session.\r\n\r\n\tHere are the two deadlines fo...\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\n\n\nSubscribe to Session Daily Updates.\n Session Daily News Feed (RSS)\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota House on Twitter\n\nTweets by MNHouseInfo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Legislature\n\n\nHistorical Information\n\n\nEmployment/Internships\n\n\nVisiting the Capitol\n\n\nDisability Access\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\nContact Your Legislator\n\nWho Represents Me?\nHouse Members\nSenators\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\n\nContact a legislative librarian:\n(651) 296-8338 or Email\nPhone Numbers\nSubmit website comments\n\n\n\nGet Connected\n\nHouse News\nSenate News\nMyBills\nEmail Updates & RSS Feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota House of Representatives \u00b7 100 Rev.
