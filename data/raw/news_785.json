Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson should lift an injunction preventing enforcement of that law. Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate argued that the judge should only allow the law to be enforced against people who are not doctors so that other abortion restrictions that the Legislature has enacted since Roe remain relevant. But Roysden said those laws were passed because the Supreme Court said the state had to recognize a constitutional right to abortion. \n\n\u201cThose laws were intended to regulate and limit abortion within the power the legislature had,\u201d Roysden told the judge. \u201cThey were never intended ... to statutorily create the right to abortion.\u201dPlanned Parenthood Attorney Sarah Mac Dougall argued that the proper way to deal with conflicting laws is to limit the reach of the old one. \nNot doing so, she told Johnson, \u201cwould turn every principle of statutory interpretation on its head and grant him an undemocratic windfall by allowing the oldest statute on abortion in Arizona books to resurrect and somehow overtake all other legislative enactments on abortion.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood said that a multitude of laws restricting and regulating abortion would be rendered meaningless if the court allowed the old law to be enforced without restrictions. Just this year, the Legislature passed a law signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey that criminalizes performing abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That goes into effect on Sept. 24, and Ducey contends that the new law he signed takes precedence over the pre-statehood law. \n\nRoysden, however, noted that the 15-week law specifically says it does not create a right to abortion or mean that the pre-statehood law is unenforceable. The court battle in Arizona is one of many playing out in Republican-led states across the country in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority overturning Roe in June. States with pre-Roe bans on the books are seeking to enforce them, while others that had \u201ctrigger\u201d laws severely restricting or banning abortion if Roe were overturned want to enforce them. Johnson said she would consider the arguments and issue a ruling after Sept. 20, a date determined by a procedural issue. The state\u2019s near-total abortion ban was first enacted decades before Arizona was granted statehood in 1912, and it\u2019s only exception is if the life of the patient is in danger. Providers across Arizona stopped abortions after the Supreme Court\u2019s June 24 opinion overturning Roe, saying it was too risky to move ahead while the old ban was still on the books. A 2021 law that grants all rights to pre-born children is also in play. A federal judge blocked a major part of that law on July 11, but providers have not restarted abortion services. \n\nThe Pima County attorney\u2019s office is siding with Planned Parenthood, with Chief Civil Deputy Samuel Brown telling Johnson that Arizonans need to know what laws will be enforced and that is not now true. \u201cThere are currently three different definitions that suggest when an abortion is allowed in Arizona. If and when this injunction is lifted, there will be a fourth definition,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOn Sept. 24, there will be a fifth.\u201dThe case over the so-called personhood law originated in 1971 when the Tucson affiliate of Planned Parenthood, several doctors and a woman who wanted an abortion sued to overturn the rule. A Pima County trial judge decided the next year that a fetus does not have constitutionally protected rights and that the law banning abortion also violated the doctors\u2019 rights to practice medicine as they saw fit.The Arizona Court of Appeals overturned that ruling, rejecting wholesale the lower court\u2019s reasoning that the abortion ban was unconstitutional and saying it could be enforced.\n\n\u201cAppellees\u2019 complaints against the abortion statutes are peculiarly within the field occupied by the Legislature and any problem concerning abortion should be solved by that body,\u201d the appeals court ruling said. \u201cWe can only reiterate that we are not a super-legislature.\u201dLess than three weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roe, and the appeals court reversed its earlier judgment. The law was then blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
