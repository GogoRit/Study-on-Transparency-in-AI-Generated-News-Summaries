But you might not know that some state officials tried to force\u00a0churches to pay for abortions.\nThat\u2019s not a typo. A California agency actually required that elective abortion coverage be added to the employee health-care plans of churches in the state\u2014without even telling them. Thankfully, Skyline Wesleyan Church took a stand against the state and won a huge victory for religious freedom.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the details of this case.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is Skyline Wesleyan Church?\nLocated in La Mesa, Skyline Wesleyan Church has been a fixture in the San Diego area for over 60 years. Everything the church does is rooted in biblical principles.\nSince its first gathering in the summer of 1954,  pastors and leaders of Skyline Wesleyan Church have called upon their congregations to live out their faith and practice what they preach. Church leaders do this by advocating for life at every stage as well as taking good care of their employees by providing them with the very best health-care policies available.\nThe California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) told the church that it must choose one or the other.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo church or individual should be forced to participate in funding abortion.\n\n\u00a0\nSkyline Wesleyan Church v. California Department of Managed Health Care\nIn August 2014, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) mandated that the health-care plans of churches and religious organizations cover elective abortions. This mandate added elective abortion coverage to Skyline Wesleyan Church\u2019s health-care plan\u2014without the church even knowing about it.\nThe DMHC  sent a letter to insurance providers in the state\u00a0telling them that it would be illegal for them to allow churches and religious organizations to exclude elective abortion coverage in their health-care plans. In its letter, the DMHC remarkably claimed that all abortions are \u201cbasic health care services\u201d that are \u201cmedically necessary\u201d and therefore must be covered.\nThese unelected officials made this decision without passing a regulation or allowing for public input. And what\u2019s worse is that they did so  after being influenced by pro-abortion groups\u00a0like Planned Parenthood.\nThe state even had evidence that its mandate would only affect religious organizations. This new low clearly violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by targeting churches and religious organizations.\nSkyline Wesleyan Church, along with millions of Christians across the country, holds the biblical belief that every human life\u2014born or unborn\u2014has worth and dignity. Opposing abortions in its health-care plans is non-negotiable. The church had no choice but to file a complaint against the DMHC, and more than seven years later, God delivered a victory.\n\u00a0\nOutcome\nTwo federal courts in California ruled that the First Amendment protects churches\u2019 right to decline elective abortion coverage in their health insurance plans. The rulings resolved Skyline Wesleyan Church\u2019s lawsuit and a separate lawsuit brought by three additional California churches.\nNo church or individual should be forced to participate in funding abortion. Every American has the right to live and work according to their faith without fear of unjust punishment by the government, and these rulings ensured those rights for Skyline Wesleyan and three other churches in California.\u00a0\nAs a result of the rulings, state officials agreed to pay $1,400,000 toward the attorneys\u2019 fees for the four churches.\n\u00a0\nCase timeline\n\nAugust 2014: The California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) issued a mandate requiring group health insurance plans, including those of churches, to provide coverage for all legal abortions.\nFebruary 2016: Skyline Wesleyan Church  filed a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the DMHC\u2019s abortion-coverage requirement.\nMarch 2018: The federal district court denied Skyline\u2019s request for relief. That April, the church  asked\u00a0the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to reverse that decision.\nNovember 2019: Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys argued the case in front of the 9th Circuit.\nMay 2020:\u00a0The 9th Circuit ruled in favor of Skyline Wesleyan Church. The court held that the church properly challenged the state\u2019s abortion-coverage mandate and that the lower district court was wrong to dismiss the church\u2019s claims. The 9th Circuit recognized that Skyline suffered an injury when the state mandated that its healthcare plan cover elective abortions. The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia in 2021.\nMay 2023: The federal district court ruled that the First Amendment protects Skyline\u2019s right to decline elective abortion coverage in its health insurance plan. A different federal court in the state had already ruled that California\u2019s mandate was unconstitutional in a separate ADF case. Given the two rulings, state officials agree to pay $1,400,000 toward the attorneys\u2019 fees for Skyline Wesleyan Church and three other churches that brought a similar lawsuit against California.\n\n\u00a0\nThe bottom line\nChurches should be free to operate according to their faith without being threatened by the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducators Have Rights, Too\n\n\n\n          March 18, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious Discrimination in Broadcasting: It's 18 Times Worse Than You Think \n\n\n\n          March 11, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafeguarding Charity Act Would Protect Nation's Nonprofits\n\n\n\n          March 5, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Biggest Cases, Big Law Tilts Decisively Left\n\n\n\n          February 16, 2024\n        \n\n          Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ADF is the world's largest legal organization\n              committed to protecting religious freedom,\n              free speech, the sanctity of life,\n              marriage and family, and parental rights.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT\n\n\nAbout ADF\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nRequest Speaker\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\nFOCUS\n\n\nReligious Freedom\n\n\nFreedom of Speech\n\n\nSanctity of Life\n\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n\nParental Rights\n\n\n\n\nCASES\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\nCases to Watch\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n\nRequest Legal Help\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nAttorney Network\n\n\nTraining & Support\n\n\nGrants & Funding\n\n\nJournalism Academy\n\n\nAlliance Programs\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\nRadio\n\n\nPrayer\n\n\nEmail Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9\n        \n        Alliance Defending Freedom is a registered 501(C)(3) Charity.\n        All rights reserved.\n\n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Terms & Conditions\n          \n\n\n          \u2022\n          \n            Financials\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
