If President Trump wins this election and puts the judge he wants in, she will absolutely outlaw it and push women back into back-alley abortions,\" Nicks said, referencing President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who he has selected to replace Ginsburg.\nAdvertisement\n\nNicks then brought up her own experience with having the option to safely end her own pregnancy.She had an abortion in 1979, two years after Fleetwood Mac released its second album, \"Rumours.\" During this time, the band's fame was at its height.\n\n\n                              Related stories\n                            \n\n\n\"If I had not had that abortion, I'm pretty sure there would have been no Fleetwood Mac,\" Nicks told The Guardian. \"There's just no way that I could have had a child then, working as hard as we worked constantly. And there were a lot of drugs, I was doing a lot of drugs \u2026 I would have had to walk away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975 and has also had a number of solo hits.\n                                \n\n                          \n                          Larry Hulst/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n                          \n                          \n\nNicks continued, saying: \"And I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to heal so many people's hearts and make people so happy. And I thought: you know what? That's really important. There's not another band in the world that has two lead women singers, two lead women writers. That was my world's mission.\"\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Nicks expressed, many Americans are concerned about the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturnedNicks' interview with The Guardian echoes concerns that many activists and everyday Americans have expressed in regard to reproductive rights.After Ginsburg's death, women's groups spoke out with concern for Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that gives women the constitutional right to end their pregnancies, which could be overturned depending on who replaces the late justice.Barrett, Trump's Supreme Court nominee, is a conservative judge. If she is confirmed, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett speaks as she attends the second day of her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, October 13, 2020.\n                                \n\n                          \n                          Brendan Smialowski/Reuters\n                          \n                          \n\nBarrett, who recently sat for two days of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, has yet to offer a firm statement on her stance on Roe v. Wade.\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked Barrett: \"Do you agree that Roe was wrongly decided?\"\"I completely understand why you are asking the question,\" Barrett said. \"I can't pre-commit or say, 'Yes, I'm going in with some agenda,' because I'm not. I don't have any agenda.\"However, records of Barrett signing an Indiana newspaper ad in 2006 that called for Roe v. Wade to be overturned have resurfaced since the announcement of her nomination.Barrett has also said that she believes it would be unlikely for Roe v. Wade to be overturned, but that she doesn't see it as a \"super-precedent\" case, or a decision that would never be overturned.\nAdvertisement\n\nBarrett's nomination will be voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 22, and later by the full Senate.Read Stevie Nicks' full interview with The Guardian here.Read more:Stevie Nicks says Botox 'destroyed' her face for 4 months and made her look like 'Satan's angry daughter'24 celebrities who have opened up about having abortions4 long-acting birth control options to consider if the Supreme Court limits contraception and abortion access\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Read next\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: Mac 'n' cheese is the star of the show at this Texas-style BBQ joint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbortion\nMusic\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nClose icon\nTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.
