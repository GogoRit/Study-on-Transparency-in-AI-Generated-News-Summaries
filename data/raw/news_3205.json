(Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary By\n\n\n\nDave Pivonka\n\nFather Dave Pivonka, TOR, is the president of Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve attended the March for Life in Washington, D.C., numerous times since they began in the mid-1970s, but this year, I have a sense of anticipation and excitement like I\u2019ve never experienced before.\nAlong with other pro-lifers around the country, I\u2019m encouraged to see better protections for our smallest citizens in Texas and Alabama. I\u2019m also encouraged to see the U.S. Supreme Court take up\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a case out of Mississippi that some observers think could open the door to overturning\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0almost 50 years after it\u00a0effectively removed every legal protection from preborn human beings.\u00a0\nWe can celebrate those milestones as real progress, and if\u00a0even one innocent baby is saved as a result, then the decades of struggle, prayer, and sacrifice have been worth it.\nEvery single human life has such profound value, meaning, and purpose, beyond anything we can imagine.\u00a0\nTragically, abortion will not disappear in the United States even if\u00a0Roe v. Wade, the 1973 high court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide,\u00a0is overturned. Instead, the battleground will simply shift, and the fight against abortion will continue as each state seeks to regulate abortion for its residents\u2014and depending on where we live, the new abortion laws may very well be more horrific than they are now. \u00a0\nThat\u2019s why we do well to remember that a change of hearts, not merely a change of law, must be the goal of the pro-life cause. That\u2019s because abortion is ultimately a question of the heart, a question of recognizing the beauty of each human life.\nThe heart of a baby starts beating about 22 days after conception. Her heart will continue to beat until she is called home. This baby\u2019s heart will experience all that a human heart can experience: a heart full of joy and peace; a heart broken; a heart full of love.\nWe pray for the hearts of all babies, that abortion will not stop them from beating. Yet our endgame must also include a change of millions of older hearts, so our whole culture respects human life at every stage. \u00a0\nNow, only God can create a human heart. Only He can change the hearts of those who do not yet recognize the dignity of each person\u2014but we can help.\u00a0\nAn article\u00a0I read recently about one of our online master\u2019s degree students at Franciscan University illustrates this beautifully.\nNineteen and unmarried, Kelly planned to abort her baby for the sake of her career\u2014and attempted to do so three times. The first time, she was put off by a chance remark from the abortion clinic receptionist; the second, by people praying outside the clinic; and the third time, stalled in traffic as her appointment time came and went, Kelly saw a \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plate on the car ahead of her. \u00a0\nI doubt the people praying outside the clinic or the owner of that license plate have any idea how powerful their prayers and witness were. But at least in part because of them, Kelly and her boyfriend\u2019s hearts were changed, and they chose life for their son. They married, and Kelly went on to start a pregnancy resource center.\nLater, convinced that \u201cabortion is the consequence of a culture that\u2019s denied the dignity of the human person\u201d and of the need to reach women before they head to an abortion clinic, she co-founded\u00a0the Pelican Project, an online resource to support parents in educating their children about the sanctity of life.\nLike Kelly, we need to pray and work for the transformation of hearts to love for life, particularly for the hearts of those most vulnerable and particularly those who cannot see the innate dignity of the human person.\u00a0\nWe need to be Christ for others, to love them, to show them kindness and mercy, and trust that God will use our efforts to bring change\u2014the change that does not depend on the courts or the legislature, but on the conviction of our culture that every human life deserves protection and should receive it from conception to natural death.\u00a0\nThe Daily Signal publishes a variety of perspectives.
