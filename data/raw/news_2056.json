(AP) \u2014 Abortion providers urged South Carolina\u2019s highest court on Thursday to lengthen the narrow window when a pregnancy can be legally terminated under the state\u2019s strict new ban.The conservative state\u2019s all-male Supreme Court last month upheld a so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law commonly understood to restrict access after about six weeks of pregnancy, which is before most women know they\u2019re pregnant. However, the court\u2019s majority opinion noted that the medical definitions written by the Republican-dominated state Legislature gave unclear directions to doctors about when they can provide an abortion. In a footnote, Justice John Kittredge wrote that the court would \u201cleave for another day\u201d whether the language \u201crefers to one period of time during a pregnancy or two separate periods of time.\u201dAttorneys for Planned Parenthood believe they have an answer. In a complaint filed Thursday, they wrote that the ban should be interpreted to take effect after approximately nine weeks under the statute\u2019s language, because that\u2019s when most of the main parts of the eventual heart have developed.\n\n\u201cThe court itself has raised this issue and we think it needs to answer this ambiguity that it\u2019s left open,\u201d Catherine Humphreville, an attorney for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told The Associated Press.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs it stands right now, providers are forced to take this more conservative approach because they are risking, essentially, jail time and the loss of their licenses,\u201d they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokespeople for both the South Carolina Senate majority leader and speaker of the House did not have responses Thursday afternoon to the lawsuit. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster will file a motion intervening in the case to \u201conce again defend the heartbeat law and protect the right to life in South Carolina,\u201d according to a statement from spokesperson Brandon Charochak.\n\nThe law prohibits most abortions after an ultrasound detects cardiac activity. Doctors who violate the ban face up to two years imprisonment. Cardiac activity can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The South Carolina General Assembly defined a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d as \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d Planned Parenthood South Atlantic argues that the most cautious medical consensus suggests the major components of what ultimately becomes the heart \u2014 the walls, valves, four chambers and electrical conduction system necessary for contractions \u2014 do not typically form before nine weeks of pregnancy.A decision in their favor would mark a big shift in the number of people able to legally obtain abortions at Planned Parenthood facilities in Columbia and Charleston. According to the complaint, around 91% of patients there have been denied abortions in the roughly three weeks since the latest ban took effect. About 58% of those unable to get abortions were nine weeks pregnant or less.\u201cIt means the difference between turning away 50% of people and turning away 90% of people,\u201d Susanna Birdsong, the general counsel for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, told the AP.\n\nAbortion providers found themselves on the defensive after the state\u2019s highest court reversed course this summer from its January decision that a similar 2021 ban violated the right to privacy. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic Communications Director Molly Rivera said the group is now fighting \u201cfor every inch of ground\u201d after failing to get the new law completely struck.___Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
