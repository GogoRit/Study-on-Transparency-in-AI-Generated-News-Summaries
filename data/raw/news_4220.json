Instead, a camera lingers closely on the back of 17-year-old Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) as she changes out of her grocery store uniform in a backroom; her bra straps dig a little bit deeper than usual in her skin. Autumn\u2019s best friend/cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder) notices, and when Autumn sprints away from her register one day, she instinctively finds her in the bathroom. We hear Autumn vomit; we don\u2019t hear her tell Skylar she\u2019s pregnant. Skylar just knows.Abortion is Normal: the emergency exhibition about reproductive rightsRead moreThis unspoken gravity holds together Never Rarely Sometimes Always, an achingly observant if pathologically spare movie from the writer-director Eliza Hittman which dwells in the mundane, confusing and quietly devastating moments of teenage pregnancy and abortion access in Trump-era America. Called a slut by male classmates (all the men in this film are either assholes or creeps) and neglected by parents exhausted by making ends meet, Autumn\u2019s only resource in her small Pennsylvania town is the local crisis pregnancy center, which purports to educate women about their choices but in effect counsels against \u201cabortion-mindedness\u201d. The specialist at the center speaks to Autumn with patronizing concern, and as the only person besides Skylar in town who knows of her condition, takes an interest in her; she also shows her a VHS tape which violently equates abortion to murder.Autumn googles self-induced abortion, the preface to one of many wordlessly brutal scenes, then how to get an abortion in Pennsylvania. The state requires women under 18 to receive parental permission, one of the many, many restrictions on abortion access enacted by conservative state legislatures since the 1973 supreme court decision Roe v Wade preserved a woman\u2019s right to an abortion in the United States. So the girls board a bus to New York City with a little cash pilfered from their creepy store manager and smartphone directions to a clinic in Brooklyn. Hittman\u2019s depiction of the city is, like the rest of her film, vigilant but passive. This is a city of hurdles and prizes, through which the girls pass nearly invisible. Their obstacles are both foreseeable \u2013 with no place to stay, they ride the trains back and forth at night \u2013 and unexpected. Farther along than she was initially told, Autumn requires a two-day procedure. A young man they met on the Greyhound bus (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin, the right mix of friendly and skeevy) becomes a queasy lifeline.It\u2019s hard to watch this movie outside its context, as states across America cracked down on access to abortion services. In 2019, 12 states passed abortion restrictions \u2013 some at as early as six weeks, before many women, including Autumn, know they\u2019re pregnant. Alabama attempted to ban abortion outright. Just last week, oral arguments began in a supreme court case over a Louisiana law that observers worry could undermine Roe v Wade. Never Rarely Sometimes Always smartly refuses to name these distressing developments outright, nor does it wade into didactic political messaging. But the stench of gaslit doubt and judgment suffuses the film. There\u2019s no mention of so-called heartbeat bills, but there is a heartbeat \u2013 on the monitor at the pregnancy center, where the provider tells Autumn, without asking her plans, that it\u2019s the best sound she\u2019ll ever hear. Autumn\u2019s journey out of state for an abortion is one an increasing number of American women will have to make \u2013 if they can make it at all.View image in fullscreenTalia Ryder in Never Rarely Sometimes Always. Photograph: Courtesy of Focus FeaturesDire context aside, Hittman steers clear of melodrama, and the choice to observe two teenage girls assess their situation and navigate their options, sans capital T Tragedy or twist ending, feels refreshing. The film\u2019s most poignant scene, which attracted buzz at Sundance and gave the film its title, captures an ordinary intake session for Autumn\u2019s second-trimester procedure at a Manhattan clinic. The counselor quizzes Autumn on her medical history with escalating emotional severity \u2013 does she have any allergies? Has anyone made her have sex against her will? \u2013 with four response options: never, rarely, sometimes, always. Each word carries a short lifetime of unspoken pain. No need to detail it. The ordinary questionnaire is enough.What\u2019s not enough is the dialogue between Autumn and Skylar; Hittman\u2019s attentive passivity works well in finding a compelling angle into an explosive political issue, but too often it extends to the characters themselves, who frequently go through whole scenes barely speaking. Flanigan and Ryder are capable actors, especially in performances as constrained as these, but too often, Hittman relies on a pained look between the girls to stand in for an unshakable bond that hasn\u2019t been given time to imprint on the viewer. Small hints \u2013 a joke in a diner booth in New York, bonding over makeshift deodorant in a public restroom \u2013 suggest a more playful, generative bond, the kind of know-what-you-need-without-saying-it mirroring that marks the best of adolescent female friendship. But there\u2019s too little evidence here to buy their reticence with each other.Still, the film\u2019s spareness has lasting power \u2013 as Skylar and Autumn boarded the bus home, I realized I had been clenching my jaw the whole movie. It\u2019s a testament to Hittman\u2019s portrayal of fear and frustration in navigating American reproductive healthcare as a teen. I just wish her characters had more to say about it.\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always is released in the US on 13 March and in the UK later this year\nExplore more on these topicsFilmAbortionDrama filmsNever Rarely Sometimes AlwaysfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
