Kevin Stitt signs nation's strictest abortion ban. It starts immediately Carmen FormanOklahomanOklahoma on Wednesday\u00a0implemented the strictest anti-abortion law in the nation, giving the country\u00a0a preview of a possible post-Roe future.\u00a0Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation to prohibit most abortions beginning at fertilization.\u00a0Stitt signed House Bill 4327 that allows private citizens to sue anyone who \"aids or abets\" a woman seeking an abortion at any point in her pregnancy.\u00a0The woman pursuing the procedure could not be sued.\u00a0In a statement, Stitt\u00a0said he was proud to sign the legislation.\u00a0\"From the moment life begins at conception is when we have a responsibility as human beings to do everything we can to protect that baby\u2019s life and the life of the mother,\" Stitt said.Related:Oklahomans, Texans now comprise majority of patients at Kansas abortion clinic, doc saysThe law that took effect immediately and openly flouts longstanding abortion protections established\u00a0by the U.S. Supreme Court has limited exceptions for medical emergencies, rape and\u00a0incest.\u00a0Under the\u00a0law from Rep. Wendi Stearman, R-Collinsville, Oklahoma will\u00a0become the first state in the nation where nearly all abortions are prohibited. In 2021, 5,950 abortions were performed in the state.\u00a0Representatives from Oklahoma's four abortion clinics said they would stop, if they had not already, terminating pregnancies immediately upon HB 4327 taking effect.\"Today, for the first time in nearly 50 years, abortion is illegal - at every stage of pregnancy - in an American state,\" said\u00a0Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of\u00a0Planned Parenthood Great Plains. \"People who can become pregnant now have fewer rights and fewer protections in Oklahoma than in any other state in the union.\"Legislators who, in overwhelming numbers, cannot become pregnant have just made lesser citizens of those who can.\u201d\u00a0Related:What we know about Oklahoma's new abortion ban \u2014 the strictest in the nationAbortion rights groups plan to sueAbortion providers and reproductive rights groups have vowed to challenge the law in court where they are suing over two other anti-abortion laws Stitt signed\u00a0this year.\u00a0Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Legal Counsel\u00a0Rabia\u00a0Muqaddam said providers will ask the Oklahoma Supreme Court to issue a temporary injunction to halt enforcement of the \"blatantly unconstitutional\" law.\"We are facing a period of time where abortion will be inaccessible .. and it's just unspeakable that anyone would pass a law to circumvent constitutional rights,\" she said last week.\u00a0More:Poll shows most Oklahoma voters don't want total abortion ban Gov. Kevin Stitt may soon signBut Texas-style abortion bans\u00a0have proved difficult to stop in the courts, namely because of the civil enforcement piece that makes the laws so unique.\u00a0With the U.S. Supreme Court indicating it is likely to overturn\u00a0Roe v. Wade, providers are preparing for abortion access to become a patchwork of regulations across the nation with conservative states like Oklahoma mostly outlawing the procedure.\u00a0Oklahoma became a refuge for many Texans seeking an abortion after the Lone Star State implemented a six-week ban in September.\u00a0Now, many Oklahomans will have to travel out of state for the procedure and Texans may have to travel even farther, said\u00a0Wales, of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\u00a0For some, travel simply won't be possible, she said.\u00a0\"Telling people now, 'can you get to Kansas City?\u00a0Can you get to Denver?'\u00a0That is going to be overwhelming\u00a0to many of the people we serve, and the impact on their lives is indescribable because this care is time sensitive and critical for a reason,\" Wales said.\u00a0\"The impact will be real and felt immediately by the people we serve.\"\u00a0Oklahomans overwhelmingly support life, Gov. Kevin Stitt saysBefore taking office, Stitt vowed to sign all anti-abortion bills\u00a0that advanced to his desk \u2014 a promise he has kept.\u00a0\"I represent all 4\u00a0million Oklahomans, and the majority overwhelmingly support life in our state.\" Stitt said in a recent interview.\u00a0December polling from an Oklahoma City\u00a0firm shows less than one-third of Oklahomans want a total ban on abortion.\u00a0Stitt said anti-abortion bills pass with overwhelmingly support from the Oklahoma Legislature, where Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers.\u00a0He also noted the state is investing\u00a0in resources for pregnant women\u00a0through the Oklahoma Health Department, nonprofits and churches.\u00a0\"We want to be the No. 1\u00a0state in supporting crisis pregnancies\" Stitt said. \"We want to love the mother, we want to love the child, we want to have adoption services.\"New Oklahoma abortion ban includes limited exceptionsThe law makes an exception for abortions necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman experiencing a medical emergency.\u00a0However, some doctors have said that exception is vague and unclear.Physicians will have to decide how sick a woman must get before they intervene, all with the threat of a possible lawsuit\u00a0hanging over their heads, said Oklahoma City OB-GYN Dr. Dana Stone.The law is unlikely to stop abortion, it will just force women to seek out unsafe abortions. It's \"disturbing' to think about some of the risks women might take to end an unwanted pregnancy,\u00a0she said.Stone also expects the law will\u00a0worsen Oklahoma's high maternal mortality rates.\u00a0\"We have a high maternal mortality rate in the United States, higher than other developed countries by far,\" she said.\u00a0\"Oklahoma has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in our country, and I think this is just going to be very dangerous for women.\"Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat, R-Oklahoma City, who opposes abortion, dismissed\u00a0concerns that the law\u00a0creates uncertainty for physicians.\u00a0\"Medical doctors are still empowered\u00a0to make that decision on what\u00a0constitutes\u00a0a risk to the life of the mother,\" he said.\u00a0\"All of our rights end\u00a0when we do harm to someone else, and we believe strongly that that life of the unborn child is another life that deserves protection.\"The law also includes an exception for victims of rape and incest if they report the\u00a0crime\u00a0to law enforcement.Senate Minority Leader Kay Floyd, D-Oklahoma City, said it's not a legitimate exception because the majority of rape and sexual assault victims don't go\u00a0to law enforcement for help.\"The odds of a sexual assault victim, a rape victim\u00a0going straight to law enforcement is low,\" she said.\u00a0\"It's not realistic. That's not how it works out in\u00a0the real world.\u00a0Medical attention is often the first thing\u00a0that they seek.\"Oklahoma also has a\u00a0\"trigger\" law on the books that would take effect if the nation's high court overturns longstanding abortion protections.\u00a0If the court's majority opinion changes from a draft opinion\u00a0leaked this month, then state lawmakers might pass additional anti-abortion measures\u00a0in an upcoming special session, Treat said.The \"trigger\" law would take effect if the court overturns Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, but new anti-abortion legislation may be needed if the court doesn't go that far, he said.\u00a0\"Depending on what that decision actually says, we may have to come in and act accordingly,\" Treat said. \"If it's as (the opinion) was leaked, we're in extremely good shape.\"The Legislature could add anti-abortion issues to the\u00a0special session\u00a0agenda if the idea gets support from two-thirds of\u00a0lawmakers in both chambers.\u00a0Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions\u00a9 2024 www.oklahoman.com.
