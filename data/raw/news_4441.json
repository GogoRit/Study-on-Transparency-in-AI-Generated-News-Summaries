Known as UN Day, this anniversary is usually a moment to reflect on the accomplishments made possible through global solidarity: the promotion of peace and human rights, scientific progress and collective public health.\nYet this year, global unity has often seemed a distant goal, with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing borders to close and people to self-isolate. In fact, the opposite is true: The pandemic has only proved that the welfare of individuals is inseparable from the welfare of humanity, and that collective action is needed for progress.\nThis year, the UN urges us to look forward to the future we want \u2013 a future that can only be realized if we work together. For UNFPA, that means looking at the future we want for women and girls, and the measures we all must take to get there.\nMaryna Saprykina promotes girls' participation in science and technology fields. \u00a9 CSR UkraineWomen\u2019s welfare, 75 years later\nFor 75 years, governments of the world have united around key goals and ideals, including the eradication of poverty, the realization of human rights and the achievement of the highest possible standard of health. But gender equality is a precondition to achieving any of these goals.\n\u201cHuman rights can never be fully upheld unless they are also enjoyed by all women and girls. Persistent gender inequalities and abuse, including sexual and gender-based violence, have deprived us of a more just and better world,\u201d world leaders agreed in a resolution adopted last month.\nThough there has been progress, it has been insufficient. According to the Global Gender Gap Report of 2020, gender parity in leadership is still about a century away, and gender parity in economic participation and opportunity will take some 257 years.\nAnd COVID-19 threatens to reverse much of the progress made by increasing women\u2019s unpaid care work, disproportionately affecting women\u2019s labour force participation, and dramatically increasing their vulnerability to violence.\nDashni Murad speaks with UNFPA staff at a reproductive health clinic.

She is the head of the board for CSR Ukraine, which works with UNFPA to promote opportunities for girls. \u201cWe understand that our work is of critical importance now, with the pandemic, lockdowns and quarantines affecting girls\u2019 and women\u2019s well-being.\u201d\nProgrammes to end gender-based violence and harmful practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation are also continuing, despite the challenges of implementation amid travel restrictions.\n\u201cSexual and gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation, has caused death among many and left others suffering throughout their lives,\u201d said Dr. Mariam Dahir, who works with UNFPA on these issues in Somalia. \u201cLet\u2019s help girls to thrive and no longer be victims.\u201d\nData Gordon speaks to men and boys about ending menstruation stigma. Image courtesy of Men4Women South SudanEquality tied to reproductive health\nGender equality cannot be achieved without ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health information and services.\nPoor information and care derail the lives and futures of millions of women every year: Every day, about 808 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Every day in developing countries, an estimated 20,000 girls under age 18 give birth. In developing regions, an estimated 217 million women want to avoid pregnancy but are not using safe and effective family planning methods.\n\u201cWe want a future where girls and young women can easily access sexual and reproductive health services,\u201d said Mohamed Jellow, the manager of a youth centre in Somalia supported by UNFPA and Mercy-USA. \u201cOur centre is providing the right information and technical skills to help girls and young women protect their sexual and reproductive health.\u201d\nBut many more such efforts are needed to ensure \u201ca future of equal opportunities and healthy independent choices,\u201d said Nataliia Koshovska, a gender expert with UNFPA in Ukraine.\nThe pandemic has affected many of the facilities that provide this kind of care. Family planning and contraception are among the most frequently disrupted health services, according to the World Health Organization, with 7 in 10 countries experiencing disruptions.\nOne key issue is that men \u2013 and male policymakers \u2013 continue to view these issues as \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d issues.\n\"I am optimistic about the future of gender equality,\" said Nataliia Koshovska. \u00a9 UNFPA Ukraine\u201cMen and boys are primarily the ones who attach stigma to menstruation. They influence the decisions of women and girls about their sexual and reproductive health, and they are the main perpetrators of gender-based violence,\u201d said Data Gordon, founder of the Men4Women Initiative in South Sudan. Programmes like his are working to \u201cget men and boys involved in promoting the rights and dignity of women and girls.\u201d\nPromises to keep\n\u201cWe will accelerate action to achieve gender equality, women\u2019s participation and the empowerment of women and girls in all domains,\u201d leaders from the world\u2019s governments promised in September.\nWomen\u2019s and girls\u2019 advocates plan to hold them accountable.\n\u201cThe proper participation of women representing half the world\u2019s population is so important,\u201d said Ms. Koshovska. \u201cAlthough we are getting closer to gender parity, the change is not happening fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cMy life experiences have left me with a burning desire to fight for gender equality,\u201d Kurdish Iraqi activist and artist Dashni Murad told UNFPA. \u201cFor as long as I can speak, this is precisely what I will do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Back to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nUkrainian refugees find life-saving care \u2013 and a support network \u2013 at Moldovan\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nInvesting in equality: How young women are innovating to improve their health,\u2026\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nTwo years of full-scale war in Ukraine takes its toll on women and girls\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPagination\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n            next\n          \n\n\n\n            last \u00bb\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter menu\n\n\nTransparency Portal\n\n\nReport wrongdoing\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nUNFPA Privacy Policy\n\n\nTransparency\n\n\nUNFPA worldwide\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\u00a9 All rights reserved. 2024\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
