Women were formally regarded as second-class citizens whose duties consisted of finding a husband, raising children, and maintaining a home. They were barred from countless professions, frequently denied access to an education, and paid substantially less than men\u2014openly and legally\u2014who did the same work. And they had no right to control their reproductive lives. Both state and federal law viewed women as vulnerable creatures in need of protection from their own ambitions. Even Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s famously liberal Supreme Court unanimously upheld Florida\u2019s exclusion of women from mandatory jury service in 1961, reasoning that \u201cwoman is still regarded as the center of home and family life.\u201d\n\n\n\nGinsburg, who died on Friday at the age of 87, saw this paternalistic head-patting for what it was: rank discrimination based on stereotypes that degraded everyone involved. She devoted her life to dismantling this caste. Later in life, the justice would say that she did not fight for \u201cwomen\u2019s rights,\u201d but for \u201cthe constitutional principle of the equal citizenship stature of men and women.\u201d At the start of her career, this principle seemed to be a distant dream. Today, it is the law of the land\u2014and under constant attack from reactionaries who will see, in Ginsburg\u2019s death, the opportunity to erase her legacy. The impact of that legacy on the nation she served is almost impossible to overstate.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ginsburg began litigating sex discrimination cases in the early 1970s, the timing appeared to be inauspicious: The court veered rightward under President Richard Nixon, seeming to bring the liberal revolution of the 1960s to a close. Yet that revolution had done little for women\u2019s equality. The Warren Court never applied the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause to strike down a law that discriminated on the basis of sex. Feminists, fearing the Supreme Court would never recognize constitutional protections against sex discrimination, persuaded Congress to approve an Equal Rights Amendment in 1972 to make gender equality an undeniable constitutional right.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nGinsburg supported the ERA, but she also believed that right already existed; she simply had to help the Supreme Court\u2019s nine male justices see it. To do so, she found cases involving laws that discriminated against men, a brilliant strategy that scored her a string of SCOTUS victories beginning in 1971. Ginsburg recognized that the justices\u2019 judgment might be too clouded by their own biases to see how laws that ostensibly helped women\u2014by, for instance, \u201cprotecting\u201d them from working or owning property\u2014actually harmed them. So she attacked laws that injured men to illustrate how sex discrimination in either direction is fundamentally irrational. One case challenged a Social Security rule that granted survivor\u2019s benefits to widows caring for minor children but denied benefits to widowers in the same situation. She described the case as \u201cthe perfect example of how gender-based discrimination hurts everyone\u201d\u2014a fact recognized by the court, which pointed out that Congress\u2019 sexist assumptions about parenting harmed fathers and children as much as women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nWith remarkable speed, Ginsburg and her colleagues at the ACLU\u2019s Women\u2019s Rights Project\u2014which she co-founded in 1972\u2014persuaded the court to apply heightened scrutiny to laws that discriminate because of sex. This rule ended lawmakers\u2019 ability to justify these measures with resort to sexist stereotypes. The court acknowledged in 1973 that such \u201cromantic paternalism\u201d had the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of putting women \u201cnot on a pedestal, but in a cage.\u201d Once on the court, Ginsburg would further heighten the amount of scrutiny applied to sex discrimination. In 1996\u2019s U.S. v. Virginia, she invalidated the Virginia Military Institute\u2019s male-only policy, holding that the government must put forth an \u201cexceedingly persuasive justification\u201d for sex discrimination. Later, in 2017, she again invoked this standard in Sessions v. Morales-Santana, clarifying that this justification must remain persuasive \u201ctoday,\u201d because \u201cnew insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality \u2026 that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the decades, Ginsburg was constantly broadening her understanding of \u201cunjustified inequality\u201d beyond her own experience. The justice\u2019s explanation of \u201cunjustified inequality\u201d in Sessions drew from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized same-sex couples\u2019 fundamental right to marry. Her connection between sex discrimination and anti-gay discrimination was prescient. A few months after Obergefell came down, Ginsburg noted that feminism and marriage equality are deeply intertwined. \u201cIt\u2019s a facet of the gay rights movement that people don\u2019t think about enough,\u201d the justice said. \u201cWhy suddenly marriage equality? Because it wasn\u2019t until 1981 that the court struck down Louisiana\u2019s \u2018head and master rule,\u2019 \u201d which gave husbands total control over marital property. \u201cMarriage was a relationship between the dominant, breadwinning husband and the subordinate, child-rearing wife,\u201d Ginsburg continued. States locked both partners into gender roles based on a stereotyped vision of what marriage means. \u201cWhat lesbian or gay man,\u201d the justice asked, \u201cwould want that?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years later, in Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court affirmed 6\u20133 that anti-LGBTQ discrimination is a form of sex discrimination. Ginsburg, vindicated, did not write the majority opinion. Nor did she write Obergefell. The justice was happy to let her (male) colleagues author watershed opinions safeguarding equal rights. She did not hog the spotlight and eagerly compromised to reach the proper result. The result, after all, was what mattered to her and to the country. After all, as she put it, she was not a queen, and she would not let purity get in the way of progress.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her last term on the bench, Ginsburg saw more\u00a0setbacks.\n\nVictories like Bostock should not obscure the fact that Ginsburg\u2019s tenure was marked by substantial setbacks for the causes she championed. After Justice Samuel Alito replaced Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor in 2006, the court began retreating from reproductive rights. In 2007\u2019s Gonzales v. Carhart, the court relied on overtly sexist logic to uphold a ban on a common second-trimester abortion procedure.* The five men in the majority reasoned that the government may need to protect women from obtaining a procedure they may later regret, declaring that \u201crespect for human life finds an ultimate expression in a mother\u2019s love for her child.\u201d (In dissent, Ginsburg castigated her colleagues for relying upon \u201cancient notions about women\u2019s place in the family and under the Constitution\u201d that have \u201clong since been discredited.\u201d)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her last term on the bench, Ginsburg saw more setbacks. Chief Justice John Roberts diminished the constitutional right to abortion access\u2014a right that is now in even graver peril. The court built upon its disastrous 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which exempted religious corporations from the duty to provide contraceptive coverage, by upholding the Trump administration\u2019s dramatic expansion of that exemption. It also expanded the \u201cministerial exception\u201d to civil rights laws, allowing religious employers to discriminate against workers on the basis of sex.\n\n\n        Recently in\n        \n          Jurisprudence\n        \n\n\n\n\n            \n            Even the Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            So Trump\u2019s Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh?\n          \n\n\n\n            \n            Mexico Is Flooded With American Guns.

In 2019, speaking at a sold-out arena in Little Rock, Arkansas, Ginsburg reminded spectators of the Constitution\u2019s opening line: \u201cWe the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union.\u201d She then challenged her audience to consider how empty those words were at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThink about how things were in 1787,\u201d the justice said. \u201cWho were \u2018We the people\u2019? Certainly not people who were held in human bondage, because the original Constitution preserves slavery. Certainly not women, whatever their color, and not even men who own no property. It was a rather elite group.\u201d But over time, Ginsburg continued, \u201cthe concept of \u2018We the people\u2019 has become ever more inclusive,\u201d growing to encompass \u201cslaves, women, men without property, Native Americans.\u201d Today, all these groups have won their right to participate in American democracy. And, the justice concluded, \u201cwe are certainly a more perfect union as a result of that.\u201d\nThe justice understood constitutional equality was an ongoing project, and she spent her life expanding equal citizenship to all Americans. That project remains unfinished, and her death will make it harder, but not impossible, to complete.\n\nCorrection, Sept. 18, 2020: This article originally misspelled Gonzales in the court case Gonzales v.
