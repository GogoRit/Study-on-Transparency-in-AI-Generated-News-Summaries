The council voted 4-3 to table the agenda.\u00a0The council member who introduced the motion to table the proposal said it is not a measure for the city but for the state Legislature,\u00a0according to the Pueblo Chieftain.\u00a0The move appears to be the first such attempt on a municipal level in the state since the U.S. Supreme court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year. Also this year, Colorado lawmakers\u00a0codified the right to abortion\u00a0into state law. \u00a0\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man, woman found dead in Denver hotel converted to homeless shelter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Missing Indigenous Alert issued for 15-year-old Alecia Naomi Sandlian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I-76 closed north of Denver metro area after equipment falls off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Meet Leo, the law enforcement puppy building bridges with older adults\n\n\n\n\n\nCBSColorado.com Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe staff at CBS News Colorado is Covering Colorado First.
