We will work on this,\" Mr Suski told public radio.Opinion surveys have shown some decline in PiS popularity in recent months, but an opinion poll by the Government-affiliated CBOS pollster showed it edging back up to 35 per cent this month, from 30 per cent in October.PiS and its two small parliamentary allies won re-election in 2019 with a 44 per cent share of the vote.Loading YouTube contentReutersPosted\u00a028 Jan 202128 Jan 2021Thu 28 Jan 2021 at 1:29am, updated\u00a028 Jan 202128 Jan 2021Thu 28 Jan 2021 at 1:44amShareCopy linkFacebookX\u00a0(formerly\u00a0Twitter)Related StoriesTens of thousands take to streets of Warsaw in continuing protests against new anti-abortion lawsPoland's top court created a near-total ban on abortions.
