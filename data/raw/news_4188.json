on Friday over the Commission on Unalienable Rights. \n    \n\n            Pompeo unveiled the commission in July 2019, saying it would be tasked with examining the role of human rights in foreign policy and refocusing on which rights should be \u201chonored.\u201d Lawmakers and human rights organizations had expressed concerns that the initiative was an effort to roll back protections for women, LGBTQ groups and minorities.\n    \n\n            On Friday, Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York on behalf of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human Rights, the Center for Health and Gender Equity, the Council for Global Equality and the Global Justice Center. It targets Pompeo, the State Department and the department\u2019s director of policy planning staff, Peter Berkowitz.  \n    \n\n            The groups allege that the commission was created and operated in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the 1972 statute that establishes guidelines that such committees must adhere to. \n    \n\n            \u201cFACA requires that committee membership be \u2018fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented,\u2019 and advice provided by committees be objective and accessible to the public,\u201d according to a Congressional Research Service report about the act. \u201cAdditionally, FACA requires nearly all committee meetings be open to the public.\u201d\n    \n\n            In a joint press release, the organizations allege that the commission, which was created by Pompeo in July 2019, is \u201cstacked with members who have staked out positions hostile to LGBTQ and reproductive rights,\u201d is \u201cholding closed door meetings to conduct significant Commission business outside of the public\u2019s view and scrutiny, including efforts to redefine human rights terminology and commitments\u201d and is \u201cfailing to provide adequate notice of meetings and to release key documents to the public.\u201d \n    \n\n            CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment on the lawsuit.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nPompeo unveils human rights commission, critics suggest it may roll back protections\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cThe Commission on Unalienable Rights\u2019 discriminatory work must be stopped, quickly. Without action we risk the destruction of decades of progress by the human rights movement and emboldening oppressive regimes everywhere,\u201d Kerry Kennedy, the President of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, said in a letter to supporters Friday.\n    \n\n            \u201cSecretary Pompeo often argues that the modern proliferation of human rights claims cheapens the currency of human rights but it is this illegal Commission, with its warped use of religious freedom and natural law to deny rights, that cheapens the very notion of religious freedom and our country\u2019s proud tradition of standing up for the rights of those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Mark Bromley, the chair of the Council for Global Equality, said in a statement.\n    \n\n            Upon unveiling the initiative last summer and in subsequent media interviews, Pompeo argued that the definition of human rights has grown overly broad and that was \u201cdangerous,\u201d as he told Hugh Hewitt.\n    \n\n            \u201cWhen everything is a right, these most fundamental, foundational rights are neglected,\u201d he claimed.\n    \n\n            News of the commission\u2019s creation drew scrutiny and concern from stakeholders on Capitol Hill and in the foreign policy and human rights community. \n    \n\n            A group of 50 House Democrats, including House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York, sent a letter to Pompeo on July 18, 2019, saying they were \u201cdeeply concerned that (his) plan to establish a Commission on Unalienable Rights is an attempt to make an end run around career experts, statutorily established State Department structures, and widely accepted interpretations of human rights law to push a narrow, discriminatory agenda that decides whose rights are worth protecting and whose rights the Administration will ignore.\u201d\n    \n\n            A group of more than 250 human rights organizations, former government officials, faith leaders, academics and advocates wrote a letter Pompeo on July 23, 2019, expressing their \u201cdeep concern\u201d with the commission. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe object to the Commission\u2019s stated purpose, which we find harmful to the global effort to protect the rights of all people and a waste of resources; the Commission\u2019s make-up, which lacks ideological diversity and appears to reflect a clear interest in limiting human rights, including the rights of women and LGBTQI individuals; and the process by which the Commission came into being and is being administered, which has sidelined human rights experts in the State Department\u2019s own Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL),\u201d the letter said.\n    \n\n            A State Department spokesperson said at the time that the commission had \u201cno hidden agenda.\u201d\n    \n\n            The commission held its first meeting in late October. Representatives from human rights organizations who were in the room for the hourslong meeting called it \u201codd,\u201d \u201csort of farcical\u201d and \u201cintensely academic.\u201d \n    \n\n            \u201cI think yesterday confirmed some of our worst fears about the commission,\u201d Bromley told CNN at the time.  \n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Nicole Gaouette contributed to this report.
