Still, it was spectacular watching the Republican Party \u2014 now little more than a personality cult for Donald Trump \u2014 give the game away on the \"pro-life\" lie by inviting an anti-abortion speaker named Abby Johnson, who let slip a few months ago on Twitter that she doesn't think married women should have the right to vote independent of their husbands.\u00a0\nThat\u00a0the anti-abortion movement is motivated by misogyny and not by some deep sense of morality was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt when the \"pro-lifers\"\u00a0backed Trump\u00a0in 2016. What the anti-choice movement and Trump\u00a0have in common is a desire to, as Trump put it, \"grab 'em by the pussy\", though Trump was clearly speaking in a more literal sense, whereas anti-choicers want to use the long arm of the law rather than the president's\u00a0greasy,\u00a0stubby fingers.\nFor whatever reason, anti-choice activists\u00a0want to maintain this ridiculous myth that their motives are a respect for \"life,\" rather than a fundamentalist zeal to\u00a0strip\u00a0women of basic human rights. So they invited Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood employee who has made a living for years telling a preposterous story, which she repeated once again on Tuesday evening at the RNC, about \"an unborn baby fighting back\" during an ultrasound-guided abortion.\u00a0\nIn the hours before the convention, however, it was revealed that\u00a0in May Johnson\u00a0had\u00a0tweeted, \"I would support bringing back household voting,\" adding, with a tee-hee\u00a0emoji, \"How anti-feminist of me.\"\n\"Household voting\" is one of those esoteric ideas that pings around Christian fundamentalist\u00a0circles, which are often organized around the idea that the founding fathers never intended the U.S. to be a secular nation, but rather a Christian nation run on \"biblical\" principles.\u00a0\nThe concept of\u00a0\"household voting\" is that\u00a0individuals have no\u00a0right to vote, and there should only be one vote per household, however that is defined. Just in case you're wondering how this would work in practice, Johnson clarified that in a later tweet:\u00a0\"In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say.\"\nJohnson has also drawn\u00a0negative attention for a video in which she argues that police would be justified in profiling\u00a0her adopted son, who is biracial, while leaving alone \"my brown-haired little Irish, very, very pale-skinned, white sons, as they grow up.\"\nTo be clear, there was never any such thing as \"household voting\" in the U.S. Before the women's suffrage movement began to make progress in the late 19th century,\u00a0women simply couldn't vote anywhere in the country, regardless of their marital or household status. But it's common in Christian right circles for wacky ideas like this to proliferate, morphing as they go, as in a game of telephone.\u00a0\nOne possible source here is pseudo-historian David Barton, who has spread a great deal of misinformation used\u00a0to prop up the idea that the U.S. was meant to be a theocracy. Barton\u00a0argued in a 2014 radio show\u00a0that bans on women voting weren't really repressive or misogynistic, but were targeted\u00a0\"to keep the family together\" by treating women as part of a \"family unit\" under \"the head of the family.\"\u00a0(Which doesn't explain why widows and unmarried\u00a0women living alone were also denied the right to vote.)\nBarton later denied that he was calling for women to lose the right to vote, which is also what Abby Johnson says. But there's no question\u00a0he was arguing that American men of the 18th and 19th centuries\u00a0had honorable\u00a0intentions when they denied women suffrage.\u00a0\nIt's difficult to ascertain how widespread this concept of \"household voting\" is within the religious right, as that's a tightly focused in-group that\u00a0tends to communicate larglyy\u00a0through newsletters, radio shows\u00a0and other methods that conceal their views from the bright light of search engines. Salon found a video on The Blaze, Glenn Beck's network, in which\u00a0two fundamentalist podcasters, Summer White Jaeger and Joy Temby, argue\u00a0in favor of\u00a0this one-household, one-vote system.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0idea doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot of traction, however, not because of concerns about going too deep into\u00a0misogyny\u00a0but because, as commenters at Jaeger and Temby's website pointed out,\u00a0this household rule would effectively disenfranchise married women while retaining voting rights for single women who live on their own. That's a pretty big loophole in\u00a0what is clearly meant to be a backdoor method to deny women the right to vote.\nIn\u00a0trying to defend herself\u00a0on Twitter Tuesday night, Johnson only dug herself in deeper by tweeting, with a winky emoji, \"Yes. So shocking! A husband and wife who are in agreement and a wife who honors her husband as the head of the home. Gasp!! What a weird, biblical concept!!\"\nShe seemed unaware that a major obstacle to designing our voting laws based on a \"biblical concept\" is not just the 19th Amendment, but the First Amendment.\u00a0\nUnsurprisingly, there's a whole lot more about Johnson that's shady. For one thing, there's good reason not to trust her tale of converting from a pro-choice Planned Parenthood employee to an anti-choice radical.\u00a0\nJohnson claims she left the organization because of a moral awakening after seeing a fetus \"fight\" against an abortion procedure, but legal documents filed by Planned Parenthood in 2009 point toward a different reason: Johnson was put on a performance review plan at the Texas clinic where she worked.\nLaura\u00a0Kaminczak, a\u00a0friend of Johnson's,\u00a0told the Texas Observer in 2010\u00a0that the disciplinary action was about the inappropriate use of work email, after she and Johnson had exchanged\u00a0sexually graphic emails. Kaminczak\u00a0also said that Johnson was attracted to the\u00a0lucrative prospect\u00a0of becoming a religious right figurehead, which promised \"$3,000 speaking gigs,\"\u00a0which is a lot more money than you can make working at\u00a0a nonprofit clinic in rural Texas.\u00a0\nThe discrepancies in Johnson's story are too numerous to recount here, but perhaps the most important, discovered by Texas Monthly reporter Nate Blakeslee, is that the abortion Johnson claimed to have witnessed simply didn't happen. And not just because her description of a 13-week fetus \"fighting\" is silly on its face. Patient records at the clinic where she worked show that there were\u00a0no ultrasound-guided abortions on that date she has cited, or in the weeks before and after.\nIn addition to her noxious views on race relations and women's suffrage, Johnson has also written extensively\u00a0on her belief that \"contraception is NOT okay.\"\nShe says she\u00a0opposes contraception is because \"Birth control was created so that we could separate sex from procreation,\" and \"you should only have sex when you are open to life.\"\nMuch of the mainstream press is covering the Johnson\u00a0controversy as a matter of insufficient \"vetting\" of convention speakers, especially after a different\u00a0speaker was booted from Tuesday's program at the last minute for tweeting a bunch of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Johnson, however, was still allowed to speak despite her track record of unscrupulous behavior and blatantly misogynist opinions.\nThe reason is simple enough: It's not like there's some\u00a0better option. The entire anti-choice movement is rife with liars, grifters and religious fanatics, and whoever they could have swapped in for Johnson would have been just as bad. It's a movement based on a lie, which is that they're about \"life\" and not about upholding the\u00a0patriarchy.
