Among self-proclaimed centrists, too, there is a growing hostility toward any law that would restrict access to abortion, no matter how modestly. \nThere is just as much hostility toward any voter who suggests such laws might be necessary. It is not enough to support abortion. A true Democrat must also put pro-life voters in their place. Recently, Pete Buttigieg flatly stated that pro-life voters don\u2019t fit in the Democratic Party. He joins many other prominent Democrats, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in essentially telling pro-lifers that Democrats don\u2019t want their support at all.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Alabama Sen. Doug Jones felt comfortable laughing off a constituent\u2019s question about whether abortion \u201cshould be banned after five months.\u201d Jones\u2019s response? \u201cWhat a stupid question.\u201d \nJones represents one of the most pro-life states in the country, in which more than half of the electorate supports abortion restrictions and Republican lawmakers regularly pass pro-life policies such as the one described. Jones is also scheduled to vote next week on the pro-life bill he so casually dismissed. Does he think himself above answering constituents\u2019 questions about his positions on the issues?\nJones is up for reelection this year. His chances at winning a full term are pretty slim, but, until now, we thought he was at least trying to make inroads with centrist Republicans and independents, two groups of voters he managed to win during Alabama\u2019s special election in 2017. Apparently, he is completely unconcerned with what these voters think about abortion. \nJones is supposed to be one of the centrists in the Democratic Party, but, when it comes to abortion, he\u2019s no different from any other Democrat. He voted against a ban on abortions after 20 weeks in 2018. In January, he voted against a bill that would prohibit the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions. He has also called his state\u2019s strict abortion ban, which is currently being challenged in court, \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201ccallous.\u201d \nThis says a lot about Jones\u2019s moderation (or the lack thereof), but it also reveals something important about the Democratic Party: On abortion, there is no room for dissent. The choice is simple: Support abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy and even beyond or lose the support of your party. \nBelieve it or not, the Democratic Party did not always support abortion so enthusiastically. In fact, Democrats led the charge against liberalized state abortion laws before the mid-1970s, according to historian Daniel Williams. \nNationally, too, Democrats were hesitant to welcome pro-choice advocates into their ranks. In 1972, one of the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination was a Catholic senator who advocated for the \u201csanctity\u201d of life. That same year, the Democratic Party soundly rejected an attempt to include abortion rights in its platform. \nNowadays, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a pro-life Democrat at all, let alone one who will proudly wear that label. If anything, mildly pro-life Democratic voters will treat their opposition to abortion as a private, personal preference, as Jones attempted to do back in 2017. The problem with this excuse, made popular by the late Mario Cuomo, is that abortion is not about private beliefs. It\u2019s a question of politics and human rights, about whether the government should prioritize human life or an adult\u2019s convenience.\nAt least now, politicians such as Jones have to be honest about which one they value.\n\n\n\n\n\nTagsAbortionDemocratsDoug JonesPro Life\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of immigrants in two cases \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew live-action Popeye movie in development from\u00a0The Sopranos writer \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 450 Jewish figures in Hollywood slam Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscars... \nMarch 19, 2024 12:10 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily on Energy: Biden officials give hints on LNG pause timeline \nMarch 19, 2024 12:08 pm \n\n\n  \n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court rules in favor of immigrants in two cases \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew live-action Popeye movie in development from\u00a0The Sopranos writer \nMarch 19, 2024 12:16 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 450 Jewish figures in Hollywood slam Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscars... \nMarch 19, 2024 12:10 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily on Energy: Biden officials give hints on LNG pause timeline \nMarch 19, 2024 12:08 pm \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information \n\n\n\nAbout Examiner\nMagazine Archive\nPolicies and Standards\nTerms Of Service\nSubscription Terms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\n \n\n\n\nYour Privacy Choices\nTransparency In Coverage\nAdvertise\nContact\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCareers\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Washington Examiner 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
