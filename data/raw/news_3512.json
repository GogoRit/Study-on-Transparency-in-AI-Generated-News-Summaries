Wade put her life in danger.\n    \n\n            CNN has told the stories of several women \u2013 including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland \u2013 and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.   \n    \n\n            Now, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn\u2019t get a timely abortion.\n    \n\n            This is her story.  \n    \n\n    The loss of a \u2018miracle\u2019 baby  \n\n\n            Amanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.   \n    \n\n            \u201cJosh always tells me he\u2019s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,\u201d Amanda said.  \n    \n\n            Three years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs. \n    \n\n            They tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments.\n\nCourtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n\n\n            \u201cVery excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,\u201d Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.  \n    \n\n            \u201cThe fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n            But then, 18 weeks \u2013 just four months \u2013 into her pregnancy, Amanda\u2019s water broke.  \n    \n\n            The amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out.  She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.  \n    \n\n            \u201cWe found out that we were going to lose our baby,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cMy cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.\u201d  \n    \n\n            She and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.  \n    \n\n            \u201cI just kept asking, \u2018isn\u2019t there anything we can do?\u2019 And the answer was \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d Amanda said.  \n    \n\n    Texas anti-abortion laws  \n\n\n            When a woman\u2019s water breaks, she\u2019s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh\u2019s baby \u2013 they named her Willow \u2013 was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOULDER, CO - JANUARY 31, 2022: Dr Warren Hern organizes his tools inside his  clinic on January 31, 2022 in Boulder, Colorado.

We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,\u201d wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.  \n    \n\n            The Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.  \n    \n\n    Going downhill very fast  \n\n\n            After her water broke, Amanda\u2019s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was \u201cconsidered sick enough that my life was at risk\u201d would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.  \n    \n\n            \u201cMy doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,\u201d she remembers.  \n    \n\n             Once they heard \u201chours,\u201d they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTara and Justin George speak with CNN about her pregnancy.

I was trying to tell Josh that I didn\u2019t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n            Josh was shocked by his wife\u2019s condition.  \n    \n\n            \u201cTo see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,\u201d he said. \u201cVery quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I\u2019ve never seen her in.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Josh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.  \n    \n\n            Her temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.  \n    \n\n    \u2018I was really scared I was going to lose her\u2019  \n\n\n            But Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn\u2019t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn\u2019t cure her, either.  \n    \n\n            About 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nWhy a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commotion, and I said, \u2018what\u2019s going on?\u2019 and they said, \u2018we\u2019re moving you to the ICU,\u2019 and I said, \u2018why?\u2019 and they said, \u2018you\u2019re developing symptoms of sepsis,\u2019 \u201d she said.  \n    \n\nSepsis, the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.  \n    \n\n            Amanda\u2019s blood pressure plummeted.

She doesn\u2019t remember much from that time.  \n    \n\n            But Josh does.  \n    \n\n            \u201cIt was really scary to see Amanda crash,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really scared I was going to lose her.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Family members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.  \n    \n\n            Doctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.  \n    \n\n    \u2018These barbaric laws\u2019  \n\n\n            But her medical ordeal isn\u2019t over.  \n    \n\n            Amanda\u2019s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it\u2019s unclear whether it will be successful.  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion rights activists demonstrate in support of women's rights on July 16, 2022, in Santa Monica, California. \n\nRingo Chiu/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nVoters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights on midterm ballot initiatives across the US  \n\n\n\n\n            That leaves the Zurawskis scared \u2013 and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.  \n    \n\n            \u201c[This] didn\u2019t have to happen,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn\u2019t have to \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t have had to \u2013 go through all of this trauma.\u201d  \n    \n\n            The Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2013 but they don\u2019t see it that way. \n    \n\n            \u201cAmanda almost died. That\u2019s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That\u2019s not pro-life,\u201d Josh said.  \n    \n\n            \u201cNothing about [this] feels pro-life,\u201d his wife added.  \n    \n\n            In many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she\u2019d be alive today if it weren\u2019t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible. And they have good jobs with good health insurance and they live in a big city with high quality health care. \n    \n\n\n    Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n  \n\n\n\n\n            \u201cAll of these things I had going for me, and still, this was the outcome,\u201d she said.  \n    \n\n            She and Josh worry about women in rural areas, or poor women, or young, single mothers in states like Texas. What would happen to them, considering what happened to Amanda?  \n    \n\n            \u201cThese barbaric laws prevented her from getting any amount of health care when she needed it, until it was at a life-threatening moment,\u201d Josh said.  \n    \n\n  CNN\u2019s Naomi Thomas and Raenu Charles contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd
