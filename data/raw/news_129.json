Along with her colleagues, she was scrambling to file a preliminary injunction on a mandatory ultrasound law that had passed in Kentucky. Without it, abortion providers would be legally forced to show and describe ultrasound images to their patients and play the fetal heart tones prior to performing an abortion, regardless of the patient\u2019s wishes. A heavy workload wasn\u2019t anything new for Burrows \u2014 she had spent two years at a corporate law firm to pay back student loans \u2014 but fighting this hard for continued access to abortion care wasn\u2019t what she thought she\u2019d be doing when she interviewed for the job.\u201cI applied to and was interviewing for this job the summer leading up to the election, when many of us anticipated a Clinton presidency,\u201d Burrows, 30, tells InStyle. \u201cWe were discussing all of our plans for proactive work, what we were going to do to expand abortion access, and our vision for a Supreme Court with a seat filled by a Democratic president.\u201dMeagan Burrows by Heather Sten.The nature of Burrow\u2019s potential workload shifted dramatically when Donald Trump was elected, but that didn\u2019t scare her off from joining the ACLU.\u201cIt\u2019s not as though the White House flipped and suddenly abortion rights were at stake \u2014 it\u2019s a battle that the reproductive rights movement has been waging at the state level for a long time,\u201d Burrows says. \u201cSo when they said, \u2018We\u2019d still love to have you if you are still interested in coming\u2019\u2026 well, the refrain that many of us have said in the movement since Trump was elected is: Yes. More than ever.\u201dRELATED: No Matter How You Feel About Abortion, You Need to Better Understand D&CAfter taking office, Trump fulfilled his campaign promise to appoint Supreme Court justices who\u2019d overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that solidified abortion as a Constitutional right. Then, conservative lawmakers passed a record number of abortion bans.In 2017, 19 states passed 63 laws restricting access to abortion. In 2019, 58 abortion restrictions passed, and 12 states passed some kind of ban. Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio moved to ban abortion at six weeks, before most people even know they\u2019re pregnant, and Alabama passed a total abortion ban. And while none of these have gone into effect \u2014 abortion is still legal in all 50 states \u2014 these laws represent a shift in the anti-abortion movement\u2019s gameplan. Instead of chipping away at access with restrictions, the GOP is putting forward blatantly unconstitutional bills knowing they\u2019ll trigger a legal challenge, which they hope will reach the Supreme Court (which is now lopsided enough to overturn Roe v Wade).So far, all is going according to their plan. This March, the Supreme Court will hear June Medical Services LLC v Gee, the first abortion case since Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined the bench. The case is being argued by the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), and if the court rules in favor of the Louisina abortion law that requires providers to acquire hospital admitting privileges \u2014 which mimics a 2015 Texas law that shut down more than half of the state\u2019s 42 clinics before being struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016 \u2014 Roe v Wade will essentially be gutted. And on Jan. 2, 2020, more than 200 members of Congress urged the Supreme Court to instead overturn the decision entirely.\u201cTheir goal has always been to prevent people from getting abortions, but they had been using this sort of incremental approach,\u201d Jen Dalven, 48, Director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, tells InStyle. \u201cBut when they saw the new Supreme Court Justices they decided to just go for broke.\u201dJennifer Dalven by Heather Sten. Sweater: La Ligne.The ACLU is currently handling 17 abortion-related cases at the state and federal levels across the country. The five women interviewed here are waging that fight alone but represent a team of 14 lawyers who make up the RFP. (They tell us there is one man on the team, and he\u2019s wonderful.)\u201cIt has really hit a fever pitch,\u201d Dalven says. \u201cBut we take a lot of strength from our clients: the folks who\u2019re fighting these laws on the ground and trying their best to serve their patients in very hostile states \u2014 the Alabamas and Kentuckys of the world, places where there\u2019s real sacrifice on the parts of their professional and personal lives. We have it pretty easy being here in New York City.\u201dOf course, what Dalven and her team consider \u201ceasy\u201d is anything but. They\u2019re working long nights, evenings, and weekends. They\u2019re missing vacations with family or working during their increasingly rare \"time off.\" They\u2019re missing bedtime routines with their kids, time with friends, and nights with their partners.Brigitte Amiri by Heather Sten.\u201cIt\u2019s been really intense for us,\u201d Brigitte Amiri, 45, Deputy Director of the ACLU\u2019s RFP, tells InStyle. \u201cThis is probably the hardest we\u2019ve all worked at a concentrated period of time. There\u2019s always been an ebb and flow to our work, but now we\u2019re at a constant [flow] \u2014 there hasn\u2019t been a lot of downtime. We\u2019re just non-stop running breathless, and that\u2019s been unusual, to have this kind of onslaught.\u201d Amiri, who has a 6-year-old daughter, says she hasn\u2019t been around as much as she'd like, and has had to pass on family and friend get-togethers as a result of her caseload. \u201cBut everyone understands and really supports my work,\" she says. \"I feel very fortunate that I have that support system to be able to do this \u2014 and hopefully we will have some down time at some point.\u201dThat down time isn\u2019t on the horizon just yet, and that\u2019s regardless of what happens in November.Alexa Kolbi-Molinas by Heather Sten. Sweater: La Ligne.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a Democratic president in office, people assume that everything is going to be fine, and don\u2019t really understand that so much of this happens at the state level,\u201d Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, 40, Senior Staff Attorney with RFP, tells InStyle. \u201cObviously a president can do bad things \u2014 we\u2019re fighting on the federal and state level \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t necessarily get easier or make the fights go away when there\u2019s a Democrat in office.\u201dThat\u2019s because a fight to keep abortion accessible isn\u2019t just about keeping Roe v. Wade on the books. It doesn\u2019t matter what federal law says if people across the country still can\u2019t get the care they need. And many already can\u2019t. A reported 90% of counties in the United States do not have an abortion provider, and six states are down to just one provider each. This is largely as a result of \u201cTRAP\u201d laws, or Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers, which put requirements on clinics that don\u2019t have much to do with health or safety (such as: the layout of a janitor\u2019s closet). When a provider can\u2019t afford to comply, they are forced to shut down.\u201cI think Kentucky is a perfect example of what happens in a state where the attacks have been just one on top of another,\u201d Amiri says. \u201cShortly after Roe was decided in 1973, there were 17 places where you could get an abortion in Kentucky. Now, there\u2019s only one \u2014 and they\u2019re our client, EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center.\u201dThe preliminary injunction the newly hired Burrows and her colleagues filed in January of 2017 was on behalf of EMW against a TRAP law. A federal trial judge struck down the law, but it was upheld in the court of appeals. On the day InStyle interviewed the RFP team, the Supreme Court announced that it wouldn\u2019t hear the case, allowing the law to immediately go into effect.The lawyers were tasked with the heartbreaking job of calling their clients and telling them that now, in Kentucky, abortion providers must administer medically unnecessary ultrasounds, show those ultrasounds to their patients, describe them, and play fetal heart tones \u2014 even if their patients say no. They did this while each awaiting their turn in the hair and makeup chair, before and after sitting for these photos.\u201cIt\u2019s really rough to have to explain to a clinic what they\u2019re going to have to do now for nonsensical reasons \u2014 for political reasons that have nothing to do with science and medicine,\u201d Amiri says. \u201cAnd as health care providers their first response is, \u2018Why? Why do we have to do something that has nothing to do with making sure our patients get the care that they need?\u2019 And that disconnect \u2014 between what health care providers know to be true and the politics of it \u2014 is just really hard to have to live with and to break the news.\u201dThe team wins more cases than it loses, though. So any disappointment in defeat, while palpable, is swiftly followed by action.Elizabeth Watson by Heather Sten.\u201cWe prepare for these things all the time, so even though we\u2019re disappointed that the Supreme Court didn\u2019t take up this case, we knew that it was a possibility,\u201d Lizzy Watson, 31, Staff Attorney with RFP, tells InStyle. \u201cMost patients just want care, so even though they have to jump through all these hoops to get it, they\u2019re going to do what they have to do. We\u2019re just trying to minimize the effect on them.\u201dThe team has also found ways to de-stress, refocus and reprioritize as they move on from a disappointing ruling and look toward the many cases ahead.\u201cI meditate every day,\u201d Watson says. Kolbi-Molinas says she leaves the house at 7:30 every morning to swim before work.\u201cIt\u2019s such a labor-intensive job,\u201d Watson continues. \u201cSo making sure we appreciate each other and making sure we all hear from each other [is important].\u201d And of course, for every lawyer on the team, perspective helps.\u201cI\u2019m not a martyr and I\u2019m not a workaholic, and I also recognize that there are people on the front lines of this battle that have such a higher level of stress in their life,\u201d Amiri says. \u201cSo I put things into perspective and I appreciate the support system and the other ways that I\u2019m able to do my job and still sleep and see my kid.\u201dBy the end of our day on set it\u2019s clear the team shares that almost-frustrating level of humility. In moments of intense stress or letdowns that would seem heartbreaking, they buck up and keep at it.\u201cThere are so many other people who are part of this ecosystem,\u201d Amiri says. \u201cThere are the abortion funds that make sure people who don\u2019t have enough money can access abortion \u2014 whether it\u2019s for travel, child care, paying for the abortion itself. There are the volunteers outside the clinic who make sure patients can get in without being harassed by protestors. We all work really hard to make sure people aren\u2019t going to go without care in these crisis moments.\u201dRELATED: Women Can Be Denied Entry to the U.S. for Looking Pregnant, According to New Trump Rule But in many parts of the country people already are going without care, and Black, brown, and poor people bear the brunt of that crisis. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Black and Hispanic people are more likely to experience unintended pregnancy than white people, due in no small part to a lack of contraception access and hurdles to reproductive health care. For Watson, whose Black father and white mother met in a Louisiana high school shortly after schools began integrating, and who left the state to find a home where they\u2019d feel safe, it is the ability to serve these communities that fuels her tireless work.\u201cI wanted the movement to be more representative of the people that we\u2019re serving,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very important to me to be in the reproductive justice spaces where we\u2019re taking about all the things that the community needs, that Black people need and Black women need and Black families need, and not just abortion.\u201dThe ACLU lawyers of the Reproductive Freedom Project all had incredibly different plans heading into the 2016 election. From expanding access to care to working with a more liberal-leaning Supreme Court, the future they envisioned on Nov. 7, 2016, in no way included a flagrant assault on the Consitutional right to access abortion care. As a result, it\u2019s difficult for many of them to even take a shot at envisioning the future now.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how busy it\u2019s going to be in 2020,\u201d Watson says. \u201cBecause it was so busy in 2019.\u201d From flying to various states to meet with the abortion providers they represent, to filing emergency briefs for individual immigrant women in need of care, the work was overwhelming and emotionally taxing. But Watson says that because it\u2019s work in which they\u2019re wholeheartedly invested \u2014 morally, ethically, professionally, and politically \u2014 it\u2019s work they gladly run toward.\u201cHow can they possibly make it worse than it already is for patients?\u201d Watson continues. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not a challenge \u2014 please don\u2019t try. But the Constitution is the floor not the ceiling, and states are always trying to lower the floor.\u201dAnd now, in 2020, anti-abortion lawmakers in those same states are working to demolish the floor entirely. Passing as many abortion restrictions as possible is a noted Republican goal for 2020, so the ACLU is responding accordingly. The team is preparing for the first hearing for the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act on Feb. 12 (an effort from the CRR as part of the Act for Women Campaign), arguing at the 9th circuit on the Title X case on Feb. 27, arguing at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on an Ohio law March 11, and preparing to file an AMICUS brief in an upcoming Supreme Court birth control case sometime in April.\u201cWe are so privileged to work at an organization that enables us to be able to say, \u2018Whatever you need that lawyers can do, we are going to do it,\u2019\u201d Kolbi-Molinas says. \u201c[Our clients\u2019] work is so important, and what they\u2019re up against on a daily basis \u2014 regardless of who is in office, regardless of what\u2019s happening at their state legislatures \u2014 is so heroic.\"To be clear, this work is done in service of what the majority of American people want and need. Support for abortion is the highest it has been in nearly two decades \u2014 71% of American voters support Roe v Wade and don\u2019t want it overturned. For the lawyers fighting against party politics, laws being passed in opposition of the will of the people is infuriating. \u201cI am someone who is often filled with rage, as they say,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas says. \u201cBut it\u2019s motivating.\u201dAnd as for Burrows, who is beginning her fourth year as an ACLU lawyer, as (she hopes) Trump begins his final year in office, the team\u2019s successes are just as motivating as their righteous indignation.\u201cI would say what pushes us forward is that we are winning a lot, despite what is happening in the world, despite the fact that it feels like sometimes we\u2019re fighting an uphill battle and as soon as we get one law blocked there\u2019s another crazy law on the table that makes no medical sense and is completely contrary to judicial precedent,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we are winning.\u201dPhotographs by Heather Sten, assisted by Flaminia Fanale.
