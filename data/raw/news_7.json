Kleinfeld\u2019s lawyers had determined that the mandate included \u201cmedication abortions,\u201d which are administered by pill\u2014the kind that Kleinfeld offered at her clinic.Kleinfeld went to each of her patients, one by one, that morning and explained that she would have to cancel their appointments. They were \u201cdistraught, upset, angry, saddened, confused, panic stricken,\u201d Kleinfeld remembers. \u201cEvery single woman was planning to proceed with her decision in whatever way was necessary,\u201d she adds. \u201cNow, just at greater risk and compounding the health crises with more health risks.\u201dBut if the decision was personally disruptive for Kleinfeld\u2019s patients, Texas\u2019s sweeping order was also an early sign of a soon-to-be explosive battle against abortion providers nationwide. On April 7, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas\u2019 ban on abortions could stand, potentially triggering a petition to the Supreme Court.Planned Parenthood, which along with the Center for Reproductive Rights and other lawyers had sued Texas on behalf of a group of abortion providers, said earlier in the day on April 7 that if the Fifth Circuit did not rule, they planned to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Alexis McGill Johnson, the group\u2019s acting president, said on Twitter after the Fifth Circuit ruling Tuesday afternoon, that they would push forward.\u201cWe won\u2019t let this injustice stand. Our patients deserve better,\u201d McGill Johnson wrote.The fight in Texas is just one of many battles nationwide. Five other Republican-led states\u2014Ohio, Texas, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma\u2014have taken similar steps to temporarily ban abortions during the coronavirus outbreak. While all of those have been challenged in court, more conservative states are considering following suit.Reproductive rights advocates are used to fighting state laws and court battles to preserve abortion access. But this is different. By using executive orders and other emergency measures, a handful of governors and state attorneys general have managed, at least temporarily, to all but shut down legal abortions. Abortion providers say these new restrictions will likely have lasting impacts, not only on the patients in search of abortions, but also on independent abortion clinics\u2019 ability to survive financially in the months ahead.\u201cThe challenges that independent clinics and their patients have had to contend with have not disappeared. Medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion raised enormous barriers before the pandemic and those barriers are becoming increasingly insurmountable now,\u201d said Jay Thibodeau, communications director for the Abortion Care Network, a national group for independent abortion providers.Independent clinics provide the majority of abortions in the United States. They often have small staffs, run on tight budgets and are constantly navigating new restrictions on the way they can provide services to their patients. While the increasing number of abortion regulations in recent years has led many clinics around the country to close, every state has maintained at least one abortion provider. Now the COVID-19 pandemic is testing that reality.\u201cIt\u2019s going to strain any nonprofit small business who works near the margins,\u201d Dr. Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director at the Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa City, says of states banning abortions during the pandemic. Some of these clinics have found emergency relief. Abortion providers, represented by lawyers and reproductive rights groups, have sued and won temporary injunctions in Ohio, Alabama and Oklahoma, and come to an agreement with Iowa. They\u2019ve argued that abortion is time-sensitive, essential health care, a position supported by seven national medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But nearly all abortions remain banned in Texas, and officials in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia have questioned whether abortions should be allowed to continue in those states as well. Eighteen other states have also joined briefs supporting Texas in its fight.Hundreds of laws placing restrictions on abortion access have been passed over the last decade, and 2019 saw a particularly large wave of legislation seeking to curtail abortions across the country. These laws have an overwhelming chilling effect. Even in cases where reproductive rights advocates ultimately win in court, providers or patients feel the consequences. For example, in 2016, the Supreme Court sided with abortion providers in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, striking down regulations in Texas\u2019 HB 2 law, which required all abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and clinics to be equipped with hospital-level surgical centers. But the court ruling came too late for many providers. \u201cWe certainly saw after HB 2, when half the clinics closed, we went from 42 clinics to 21 virtually overnight,\u201d says Dr. Robin Wallace, co-medical director at Southwestern Women\u2019s Surgery Center in Dallas. \u201cAnd then with the favorable Supreme Court ruling in 2016, only a handful of clinics reopened. We did not see a rebound in terms of access.\u201d In addition to finding an abortion provider, patients must now worry about whether they are going to spread, or contract, COVID-19, Wallace notes. \u201cThey are not only being turned away from the health care that they would normally be able to access in their home state,\u201d she says, \u201cbut now they\u2019re having to grapple with this decision of, do I violate this stay at home guideline in order to seek my abortion?\u201dIn Texas, patients have had to travel particularly far from home. Nearly half of the state\u2019s 254 counties were 100 miles from the nearest U.S. abortion provider before the COVID-19 order, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin. With all Texas clinics now blocked from offering abortion, 94% of the state\u2019s counties are more than 100 miles from a provider, and nearly three quarters are more than 200 miles away.And the situation isn\u2019t great for abortion providers going forward, Wallace adds. While Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and other abortion providers continue to pursue legal action, the current ruling has allowed Abbott\u2019s order stopping abortions, which currently lasts through April 21, to stand. \u201cThat amount of time not being able to provide care absolutely could be financially devastating and result in more clinic closures across the state,\u201d Wallace says.In Oklahoma, the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma city was facing similar conditions until April 6 when a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state\u2019s abortion ban. In the first week that Oklahoma\u2019s order stopped abortions, Trust Women had to cancel about 160 appointments, according to Julie Burkhart, its CEO and founder. Most of her staff was already working remotely, and she had started to think about what would happen if the clinic had to stay closed for longer. \u201cThat would absolutely impact us financially,\u201d Burkart said in an interview on March 31. \u201cWithin the month I would really have to sit down and make some tough decisions.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision on April 6 will let Trust Women to start providing some abortions again, but not all procedures are allowed and the picture could change. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief that we can start seeing patients again, at least for now,\u201d Burkhart said on April 6. \u201cWe hope the court will keep the ban blocked so our patients aren\u2019t forced to travel to other states to find abortion care at a time when travel is risky and discouraged.\u201dCOVID-19 has brought up other concerns for abortion providers, too. In Iowa, where Hardy-Fairbanks says she\u2019s grateful that her state\u2019s agreement now allows her to make case-by-case determinations and provide abortions in compliance with the governor\u2019s order, the clinic has had to cut back in other ways.\u201cThe coronavirus in general has had a big impact,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re a healthcare clinic. We do trans care and contraception care and well visits, and all of those kinds of visits we definitely can\u2019t do right now because they need to be delayed in order to allow people to stay home and to conserve our resources.\u201d Those restrictions create complications for patients who need that care, but providers say they were making those tough choices and taking COVID-19 precautions on their own before states stepped in. \u201cAs family planning specialists, we were already acutely aware that an appropriate public health response was going to include some limitations on how other health care services continued during the crisis,\u201d Wallace says.Weeks before the Texas order to stop providing abortions, Wallace says her clinic was in touch with local health officials and had started screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms, practicing social distancing and limiting the number of people in the clinic. All the abortion providers who spoke with TIME said they had previously added these elements, as well as other measures including staggering appointment times, increasing cleaning and cutting back on other services.As abortion providers face destabilizing conditions, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to access government relief funding the way other medical providers and nonprofits will be able to do. The CARES Act stimulus package gives President Trump\u2019s Small Business Administration the leeway to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, and the final law also includes Hyde Amendment-like language, which experts say prevents state and local governments from using COVID-19 funds to help abortion services. Several providers told TIME that they were unsure if they would be able to keep their staffs paid and protected during this time. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in Texas for seven and a half years now and have weathered the storms of HB 2 and other threats to access over time. And this by far is the most painful,\u201d Wallace says. \u201cWhen you layer this restriction of necessary health care on top of the public\u2019s concerns about the unknown of their future well being, it is just really beyond tragic. It was devastating.\u201dMore Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn: The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
