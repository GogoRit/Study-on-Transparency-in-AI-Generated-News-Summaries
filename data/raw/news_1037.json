At least four other states have similar \u201cpersonhood\u201d laws in effect, including Missouri, Kansas, Georgia and Alabama.\n\nIt is unclear if abortions that have been halted in Arizona since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that women do not have a constitutional right to abortion would restart. Abortion providers stopped virtually all procedures because a pre-1901 banning all abortions that may be in effect and other laws created too much risk.\nAt least in Pima County, where the 1901 law remains blocked, they could be legal, although Attorney General Mark Brnovich plans to ask a court to lift that order and allow enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRayes had refused to block the personhood law last year, but abortion rights groups renew their request after Roe v. Wade was struck down. They argued that providers fear they could be charged with child abuse, assault or a litany of other crimes, and that the law was too vague. There is also concern of civil and regulatory action. The attorney general\u2019s office told the judge that the personhood law created no new criminal laws, but admitted in their court filings that prosecutors and courts could have a different view. \n\nAbortion rights groups hailed the ruling. \u201cThe court made the right decision today by blocking this law from being used to create an unthinkably extreme abortion ban,\u201d said Jessica Sklarsky, a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights who argued the case. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s catastrophic decision overturning Roe v. Wade has unleashed chaos on the ground, leaving Arizona residents scrambling to figure out if they can get the abortion care they need.\u201dAn Arizona attorney general\u2019s office spokesperson said they are focused on \u201cbringing clarity to the law for Arizonans.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s ruling was based on an interpretation of Arizona law that our office did not agree with, and we are carefully considering our next steps,\u201d spokesperson Brittni Thomason said in an email.An attorney general\u2019s office lawyer told Rayes during a July 8 hearing that the law creates no new crimes that could lead to charges. The \u201cpersonhood\u201d law says all other state laws should be interpreted to bestow all rights to an unborn child. The attorney general\u2019s office said in court filing that Rayes got it right last September when he refused to block the law. Rayes had cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 1989 where the court declined to block Missouri\u2019s nearly identical law.\n\nRayes said he has now changed his mind about the relevance of that case.\u201cThe Court is now persuaded it was wrong to rely on Webster the first go around,\u201d he wrote. Sklarsky had argued the personhood law is unconstitutionally vague on several fronts and told Rayes that the attorney general said in its court papers that it\u2019s \u201canyone\u2019s guess\u201d how state judges or prosecutors might apply the law.Rayes\u2019 ruling blocks enforcement of the law while the challenges precede though the court, including a possible trial.\u201cMedical providers should not have to guess about whether the otherwise lawful performance of their jobs could lead to criminal, civil, or professional liability solely based on how literally or maximalist state licensing, law enforcement, and judicial officials might construe the Interpretation Policy\u2019s command,\u201d Rayes said.\n\nStates now have wide-ranging rights to limit abortion, and many laws limiting or blocking all abortions that were previously blocked can now be enforced. That has led to battles in many states over which laws are now enforceable.Arizona is in that position, with Republican Gov. Doug Ducey saying a ban on abortions after 15 weeks that he signed in March takes precedence over the pre-1901 law Brnovich said is in effect.There were just over 13,000 abortions in Arizona in 2020, according to the most recent report from the Arizona Department of Health Services. Of those, fewer than 650 were performed after 15 weeks of gestation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
