Texas, the lawsuit led by the Trump administration and 18 Republican state attorneys general to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. If they succeed, 224,000 Wisconsinites could lose access to health care and more than 2.4 million Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions could lose vital protections, according to the Center for American Progress.\nAnd make no mistake, despite Barrett\u2019s evasive answers on the ACA (and nearly every other topic), she is on the record opposing Obamacare.\nIn a 2017 law review article, Barrett questioned the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and sided with Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissent from Chief Justice John Roberts and the majority in a 2012 decision arguing that the ACA\u2019s individual mandate is a constitutional tax.\u00a0\nAs Emergency Room physician Chris Kapsner pointed out, one in five Wisconsinites who have pre-existing conditions are at risk if the ACA is overturned.\n\u201cAs an ER doctor, I know everyone needs health care,\u201d Kapsner said during the press conference. \u201cAnd the Affordable Care Act was a big step in the right direction to giving people access to world class healthcare. For the last 10 years, over 10 years, we\u2019ve heard repeal and replace, and instead of making the Affordable Care Act better, they just want to tear it apart, and there is nothing to replace it with.\u201d\nThe irony here is that Barrett is a darling of the the right because of her \u201cpro-life\u201d views. As Judiciary Commitee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham put it: \u201cThis is the first time in American history that we\u2019ve nominated a woman who is unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology, and she is going to the court.\u201d\u00a0\nYet, as Renee Gasch pointed out, \u201cwhat hurts \u2026 is that this Supreme Court nomination is being done in the name of the pro-life movement. But it doesn\u2019t really feel like they\u2019re that concerned about my life or my family\u2019s life.\u201d\nBeyond overturning\u00a0 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an unpopular cause Republicans know is a loser with voters, so they are now seeking to force it through the courts \u2014 Barrett also represents the Trump administration\u2019s complete contempt for the lives and health of the American people during the pandemic. Celebrating her nomination at a mask-free event that appears to have accelerated the explosion of COVID-19 infections at the White House, Barrett, who has had COVID-19 herself, failed to observe basic social distancing practices. Now she is sitting through in-person confirmation hearings led by committee chairman Graham who has refused to be tested despite meeting with other Republicans who have tested positives, and who is calling on his own staff and colleagues to be in the committee room to push through her nomination despite the risk.\nThis lack of concern for life will forever taint Barrett\u2019s nomination.\u00a0\nDuring the hearings, Barrett pleased her Republican backers with her calm, professional demeanor. They were (patronizingly) fascinated by how she juggles work and\u00a0 family.\u00a0 Mike Braun (R-Ind.), called her a \u201clegal titan who drives a minivan.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) gushed over her \u201cwonderfully well-behaved children\u201d and\u00a0 Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) marveled at how she and her husband, as full-time professionals, \u201ctake care of your large family.\u201d\nAll of this might be charming, were it not for that fact that so much is at stake for millions of other women, for whom Barrett\u2019s confirmation will be an unmitigated disaster.\nFor, despite her many evasive answers, as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) deftly pointed out, there is no mystery about where Barrett stands on health care or women\u2019s fundamental reproductive rights.\u00a0\nNot only is Barrett an outspoken proponent of overturning Roe v. Wade, she joined a dissent when she sat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals when the court refused to hear an appeal on then-Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s crazy law mandating that women who had abortions or miscarriages be forced to hold funerals for their fetuses.\nThis is not just conservatism. It is an embrace of paternalistic government control over women\u2019s most intimate lives.\nAt her Senate confirmation hearing, Barrett has done her job, maintaining her disciplined refusal to answer even the most basic questions, including whether a president should commit to a peaceful transfer of power, whether she would recuse herself from a case involving the election \u2014 which Trump has explicitly mentioned as a reason to rush through her nomination \u2014 and whether it is illegal for gun-toting \u201celection observers\u201d to intimidate voters at the polls.\nThat last question, put to Barrett by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), elicited a mealy-mouthed response from Barrett about not prejudging cases that might come before her. Klobuchar followed up by reading the actual text of the federal law. There is no ambiguity. It is a crime to intimidate voters. The least we can expect of a Supreme Court justice is to acknowledge that.\nUnder questioning from Harris, Trump\u2019s nominee said, incredibly, that she had no idea that Trump has said he wanted to nominate a justice who would overturn the ACA.\u00a0\nHer refusal to say she would recuse herself from an election-related decision left little doubt that she would be willing to play a role in helping Trump undermine voting results in November if they don\u2019t go his way.\nThis administration has done more to destroy faith in government in a shorter period of time than any administration in history. If Barrett lands on the Court after a rushed process in which she refused to commit to the most basic protections of Americans\u2019 health, safety, and democracy she will be part of the historic undermining of the integrity of our public institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXAmy Coney Barrett is not pro-life\nby Ruth Conniff, Wisconsin Examiner October 15, 2020\nAmy Coney Barrett is not pro-life\nby Ruth Conniff, Wisconsin Examiner October 15, 2020\n Renee Gasch, a young mother in De Pere, Wisconsin, who receives daily treatments for her thyroid cancer, is worried about what will happen to her and her family if the Affordable Care Act is overturned.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re living with cancer, toxic stress is your enemy,\u201d Gasch said during a virtual press conference with Attorney General Josh Kaul organized by Protect Our Care Wisconsin. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing more stressful than thinking about the Supreme Court overturning protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBefore I was just worried about dying,\u201d she added. \u201cNow I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to bankrupt my family first.\u201d\nProtect Our Care organized the press call to discuss what\u2019s at stake for Wisconsinites as Republicans rush to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with a nominee who has repeatedly stated her opposition to the ACA.\nRamming through Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation \u201cwill lead to harmful health consequences for people in Wisconsin and across the country,\u201d Kaul said, pointing to the 20 million Americans who are covered by the ACA.\nBarrett would join the court just in time to hear oral arguments on Nov. 10 in California v.
