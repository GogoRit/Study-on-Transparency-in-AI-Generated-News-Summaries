Propaganda for the sexual revolution flowed from the pages of such publications as Cosmopolitan, where a young journalist named Sue Ellen Browder (among others) worked hard to push unmarried sex, contraception, and abortion as integral aspects of feminism and liberation for women. Browder\u2019s life and her role in the movement are chronicled in Subverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women\u2019s Movement (Ignatius Press, 2019). Browder now works tirelessly to make reparation for the part she played in the sexual revolution.\nHer latest book is Sex and the Catholic Feminist: New Choices for a New Generation (Ignatius Press/Augustine Institute, 2020). In this book, Browder looks at the Christian and Catholic thread of the feminist movement, exploring how it has been ignored by the mainstream media for over 50 years. She challenges the notion that feminism is inherently atheistic. She emphasizes that feminism is about a search for personhood and identity\u2014a search that will only find what it seeks in God.\nBrowder recently corresponded with Catholic World Report about her latest book, feminism, and her role in the sexual revolution (and how she hopes to atone for that).\nPaul Senz, for CWR: How did the book come about?\nSue Ellen Browder: I wrote this book as an act of atonement. From the 1970s into the 1990s I worked first on staff, then as a freelance writer, for Cosmopolitan magazine, where many stories we concocted about women having all these exciting, \u201cfulfilling\u201d sex lives were completely made up. Cosmo\u2018s editor-in-chief, Helen Gurley Brown, even had a list of \u201crules\u201d on how to write for Cosmo, which included guidelines on how to fabricate anecdotes about women who were living this supposedly carefree Cosmo lifestyle. It was only after I became a Catholic that I saw what terrible damage those lies had done. That\u2019s when I realized I had to write a book about all the lies we told\u2014to set the record straight and to keep more women and girls from being hurt.\nCWR: \u201cFeminism\u201d is a term that is just loaded with baggage today. There are so many competing definitions of the term, so many appropriations of the feminist ideology. Has the term always been so divisive? \nBrowder: I think the word \u201cfeminism\u201d has always been divisive because it\u2019s been associated with political movements, like the campaign to win women the right to vote (which was quite a controversial demand in its day). But the term became even more divisive in the late 1960s when feminism became so closely aligned with sexual politics, including gender ideology and the sexual revolutionaries\u2019 demands to repeal\u00a0 all abortion laws. There are so many forms of \u201cfeminism\u201d in our culture today that many people understandably believe the word has become meaningless. But as Joseph Pieper wisely put it, abuse of language is abuse of power. Rather than abandon the word \u201cfeminism,\u201d Christians need to restore it to its proper meaning. In the days of the suffragists, feminism was primarily a Christian movement. That\u2019s just one reason we need to reclaim the \u201cF-word\u201d (feminism) and shout it to the skies.\n\n\n\nCWR: How would you define true, authentic feminism?\nBrowder: True, authentic feminism is about defending a woman\u2019s personhood. Authentic feminism, which includes mothers, calls for women to be treated with equal dignity and respect in all areas of our society, both at home and in the public square. What did Betty Friedan, who launched the 1960s feminist movement with her book The Feminine Mystique, say feminism was all about? Was it about sex? Gender? Money? Power? No, Friedan said feminism was all about a woman\u2019s personhood. And where does a woman find this fullness of her personhood? We find our true personhood\u2014or what\u2019s popularly called the \u201ctrue self\u201d\u2014not by demanding power for ourselves but through self-giving relationships of love with God and others. Pro-life feminism defends the dignity of every human being\u2019s true personhood from conception to natural death, which is exactly what the Catholic Church teaches. That\u2019s why I am now firmly convinced the pro-life movement (visible in the March for Life, Feminists for Life, and hundreds of other pro-life organizations) represents the authentic women\u2019s movement of the 21st century. Pope St. John Paul II called upon Catholics to embody a \u201cnew feminism,\u201d and I believe pro-life women (along with the pro-life men who support them) are doing exactly that.\nCWR: Why do you think it is that so many people see the terms \u201cfeminist\u201d and \u201cpro-life\u201d as contradictions?\nBrowder: Because that\u2019s the way the media (myself included) have framed the story for the past 50 years. What we didn\u2019t realize is that it was primarily pro-life feminists who won women the right to vote, opened up academia to women, forced newspapers to stop running \u201cHelp Wanted (Male)\u201d and \u201cHelp Wanted (Female)\u201d classified ads, and lobbied to win the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (which made it illegal to fire a woman just because she was pregnant). I\u2019m not saying pro-life feminists won all these victories single-handedly; pro-abortion feminists worked on those issues, too. But I do think it\u2019s safe to say pro-life-for-all feminists did a huge chunk of the work and legal-abortion-for-all feminists received most of the media credit.\nCWR: What do you mean when you refer to the \u201cCatholic feminist\u201d? What distinguishes a Catholic feminist from another (apart from their being a Catholic)?\nBrowder: This book could easily have been titled Sex and the Christian Feminist, because while some early pro-life feminists were Catholic, others were Quakers, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists. Christian women of many denominations have always defended the full dignity of all human persons. But because the Church has been defending the whole truth taught by Christ since the apostolic age, when we speak that truth clearly with love, I think we\u2019re given a special grace to unite many people of goodwill in all nations and all walks of life, including nonbelievers. As James Joyce famously put it in Finnegans Wake: \u201cCatholic means \u2018Here comes everybody.'\u201d\nCWR: Do you think your personal history has helped you have a greater insight into the problems with the mainstream \u201cfeminist\u201d movement?\n\n\n\nBrowder: Yes, absolutely. When I was sitting at my little blue desk in the offices of Cosmo in 1971, I observed one small fact that was obvious to anyone who was there at the time but which has now been forgotten. In those days, the sexual revolution (as we were promoting it at Cosmo) and the feminist movement (as it was led by Betty Friedan) were two radically separate movements. Although Helen Gurley Brown would have loved for her sex-revolution magazine to be part of the feminist movement, Betty Friedan called Cosmo \u201cquite obscene and quite horrible.\u201d Feminism, as Friedan saw it, was a call for a woman to be able to exercise her full potential\u2014her full personhood\u2014both at home and in the public square. So how did we get to the point where so many young women in our nation today believe that to be a feminist means when it comes to sex \u201canything goes\u201d? How did those once radically separate movements get joined together in so many people\u2019s minds? After I became a Catholic, that question kept haunting me, and I started researching Subverted to find out the answer. Sex and the Catholic Feminist takes what I learned during the five years I was writing Subverted and carries those findings one giant step further.\nCWR: Was there anything you learned over the course of writing the book that you found especially surprising?\nBrowder: Oh, my, where to begin? Both books are filled with surprises! It was a great surprise to discover how abortion was inserted into the women\u2019s movement behind closed doors by the vote of only 57 people! I was stunned to learn how two men most of us have never heard of managed to foist off abortion and contraceptive drugs on American women as \u201crights\u201d we all need to be \u201cfree.\u201d I was amazed to find Betty Friedan defending motherhood and the family in such strong language she almost sounded like the pope! There are so many unexpected twists and turns in this previously untold story, I can\u2019t begin to name them all.\nCWR: Is there anything else you would like to add?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBrowder: I would simply urge all women who are searching for the whole truth to read this book, both older women of my boomer generation (who want to know how it all happened) and younger women (who need to know how to avoid being duped by what the loudest voices in our culture are saying). Sex and the Catholic Feminist, which is a very quick read (only about 100 pages), is also written for good dads who want to know more clearly how to protect their daughters from all the fabricated half-truth, limited truth, and out-of-context truth (i.e., propaganda) about so-called sexual \u201cfreedom,\u201d which dominates our culture and is being aimed nonstop at our girls before they\u2019re even old enough to think.\n\n\nIf you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

We are seeing the effects of double income couples dropping their child at the government school to be indoctrinated, instead of mom staying home to homeschool. Because of double incomes, employers don\u2019t even know what to pay as a living wage. Feminism has ravaged marriage and has little to say for it.  Speaking as a woman I get that women can be anything they want to be but I don\u2019t have to think it\u2019s good or been good for society.\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust 8, 2020 at 6:38 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t buy into the gender ideology that says that there is some \u201cinherent nature\u201d to a woman.

And after that, humans are unique and varied and needn\u2019t be put in boxes according to their sex.\nIf you are implying that women somehow belong at home, that being \u201chome\u201d and \u201chomeschooling children\u201d is somehow more natural than, or even superior to, working or pursuing gifts and talents, that\u2019s about as sexist and insulting as a view of women can get. Women are not obligated to stay at home and make babies and tend to children to the exclusion of everything else.

Considering, now, that the deception has jumped the fire lane from self-destructive promiscuity into the BIG LIE triad of: (1) social evolutionism (the inevitable \u201cright side of history!\u201d); (2) in addition to the motel-room \u201cpill,\u201d now an entire world driven by morally-ambivalent Technocracy; and finally (3) the wraparound cosmology of a spiritually deflated entire universe\u2026 \nIn the first instance, DARWIN himself bemoaned his own suffocating narrowness, that his \u201cmind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive.\u201d\nIn the second instance, OPPENHEIMER, at Alamogordo in 1945 and inventor of the atomic bomb, famously blurted, \u201cNow I have become death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d\u2014while the physicist in charge of the nuclear bomb test site, responded: \u201cWell, Oppie, now we\u2019re all sons of bitches!\u201d\nIn the third instance, DAWKINS (The God Delusion, etc.) fully seduces a non-believing generation with the fiction that all beliefs are random accidents that spread from one non-person to another like any other mere \u201cvirus\u201d (spiritual COVID-19!).\nBut then this: Georges BERNANOS offers a possible one-word preamble to Browder\u2019s valuable book: \n\u201cPurity [!] is not imposed upon us as though it were a kind of punishment, it is one of those mysterious but obvious conditions of that supernatural knowledge of ourselves in the Divine, which we speak of as faith. Impurity does not destroy this knowledge, it slays our need for it. I no longer believe, because I have not wished to believe. You no longer wish to know yourself\u201d (Diary of a Country Priest, 1937).\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFr Peter Morello, PhD\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly 29, 2020 at 9:29 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nIn the third instance, DAWKINS The God Delusion fully seduces a non-believing generation with the fiction that all beliefs are random accidents that spread from one non-person to another like any other mere \u201cvirus\u201d spiritual COVID-19!
