Thousands of pregnancy centers throughout the United States and many pro-life organizations deserve our praise. Countless individuals over the past fifty years have worked tirelessly toward securing the right to life for the unborn\u2014many of whom will only be fully recognized in eternity for their influential roles. Yet, there is one man in particular who made so much of this possible.\u00a0\nFrancis Schaeffer is very much the \u201cfather\u201d of the pro-life movement among protestants. Without his work and influence, Dobbs may never have come to pass. Garry Wills, in his book Under God, rightly notes that regarding the increase in pro-life activism, \u201cOne man deserves more credit than anyone else\u2014Francis Schaeffer.\u201d It was Schaeffer who developed the vision and framework for the pro-life movement as we understand it today. And yet, he was the exception during the early post-Roe years. Shortly after Roe was decided, former SBC president and pastor W. A. Criswell \u201cfelt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person.\u201d Evangelicals in the middle of the last century were largely unconcerned about the atrocities of abortion, and were ambivalent toward activism on the matter. Advocacy for the unborn was deemed a \u201cCatholic issue,\u201d unimportant to many protestants.\nNot to Francis Schaeffer.\nBecause human beings are made in the image of God, they possess inherent dignity. This principle influenced Schaeffer\u2019s apologetics as much as it did his public theology. He embodied this doctrine in the way he conversed with skeptics and cared for the most vulnerable. He believed each and every individual\u2014regardless of their age, status, race, nationality\u2014had immeasurable worth as a human being.\nBecause of this, Schaeffer challenged the heinous practice of abortion, which he regarded as an assault on the imago Dei. Without the imago Dei, he argued, human life is cheapened and lacks value, leading to an increase not only in abortion, but also in infanticide, euthanasia, child abuse, pornography, torture, crime, and violence. Schaeffer understood that abortion did not operate in isolation; it opened the doorway to other evils.\nSchaeffer wrote extensively on this topic in various books and articles. He does not mince his words. In The Great Evangelical Disaster, he writes: \u201cYou cannot be faithful to what the Bible teaches about the value of human life and be in favor of abortion.\u201d In Whatever Happened to the Human Race?, Schaeffer criticizes abortion-on-demand, abortion techniques, live births after abortion, child abuse, and more. He was nothing short of prophetic in this regard, as many of these issues remain prevalent today.\nSchaeffer encouraged Christians to bring legal and political action against hospitals that perform abortions and abortion clinics, and to mobilize pro-life voters in their community and work with lawyers and legislators toward overturning Roe. But he also emphasized the need to tangibly help young mothers and families who find themselves in crisis pregnancies\u2014demonstrating his care not just for an issue, but for real people in real situations.\nOne of Schaeffer\u2019s last publications before his death was an article titled \u201cChristian Faith and Human Rights,\u201d published in The Simon Greenleaf Law Review. In the article, he clarifies his concern for those he believes to be most endangered by the utilitarian worldview so prevalent in the West: the unborn and the elderly. Regarding abortion, he writes: \u201cThis protection [of rights] was for everyone, but it peculiarly was a protection for the weak. . . . Regard the unborn infant, and the newborn child who is allowed to starve to death because he or she does not come up to someone's concept of what is an adequate standard for life.\u201d He continues: \u201cAnd down the road a bit, the aged, who are seen and certainly will be increasingly seen as a demographic burden and nuisance, economically and socially.\u201d Simply put, Francis Schaeffer cared about individuals made in God\u2019s image, no matter their age. He embodied an all-of-life pro-life ethic.\nFor Schaeffer, the devaluation of human dignity and the devaluation of the rule of law are linked. He concludes the article: \u201cThere is an unbreakable link between the existence of this God and the unique dignity and worth of the individual human being made in His image. And there is an unbreakable link between the existence of this God and any sufficient basis for law, and specifically for inalienable rights.\u201d Thus, Schaeffer believed that the objective truth of God, as revealed in the Christian Scriptures, not only informs our anthropology, but our politics as well. And God is not silent; he provides the answers to the difficult questions we grapple with in every sphere. We need only listen.\nToday, post-Dobbs and nearly fifty years since Roe, we can be thankful for achieving this incredible milestone. We can rejoice with those who rejoice. And while there is more work to be done, we can be grateful for the faithful work of the \u201cfather\u201d of the pro-life movement, Francis Schaeffer, who modeled for us a rich pro-life vision of ministry and action.\nChristopher Talbot is program coordinator for youth and family ministry and campus pastor at Welch College.
