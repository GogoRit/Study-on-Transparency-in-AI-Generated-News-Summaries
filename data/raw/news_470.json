It\u2019s bad for women and bad for doctors.\t\t\n\n\n\n\nby\nDr. James Monaco \n2:51 AM MDT on Sep 7, 2020\n\n\nWhy you can trust The Colorado Sun\n\n\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-abortion interest groups want you to believe they\u00a0 care about the lives of pregnant women. But make no mistake \u2014\u00a0 in their recent attempts to ban abortion in Georgia, Ohio and Alabama they have worked to pass laws that either made no exceptions or had lawmakers supersede doctors in judging what constituted a life-threatening condition.\u00a0\nProposition 115, the abortion ban on the Colorado ballot this November, is no different.\u00a0\n\u00a0Many of the same politicians and people behind these dangerous laws have come to Colorado selling another ban with no exceptions for maternal risk.\u00a0 As a physician, I feel compelled to speak up, for women, for my patients and for my profession.\u00a0\nDr. James Monaco\nProposition 115 is bad for all of us.\u00a0 It will result in unnecessary maternal deaths.\u00a0It will force many women through suffering few could imagine.\u00a0And it will make Colorado a less desirable place for all physicians to work.\nI am a cardiologist.\u00a0Most people know cardiologists manage patients with problems like heart attacks and strokes.\u00a0Fewer may realize that we play an essential role in the care of high-risk pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n\nA pregnant woman\u2019s heart must perform incredible feats.\u00a0It must pump 50% more blood per minute than it did before pregnancy.\u00a0In delivery, it will face huge swings in blood pressure with each contraction. The heart must be able to tolerate losing up to a liter of blood during delivery.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is not trivial for even a healthy heart, which is why one in three maternal deaths happen because of heart or vascular disease.\u00a0Cardiologists help women with increased risk navigate pregnancies that can be the most emotionally and physically demanding experiences of their lives. For most of these women, we are happily able to help achieve their goal of a safe and healthy childbirth.\u00a0\nREAD:\u00a0Colorado Sun opinion columnists.\nSome, however, face unmanageable risks, or develop clear signs their bodies are not tolerating pregnancy.\u00a0For these women, their families, and their doctors, it is essential that they have access to all medically appropriate options \u2013 including abortion.\u00a0\u00a0\nDefenders of Proposition 115 argue the measure provides women with ample time to be evaluated and determine if their pregnancy poses a risk to their health.\u00a0Even in an ideal world, this would be false.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\n\nIt is important to understand that even an uncomplicated pregnancy carries a risk of death.\u00a0For women with heart disease, this risk may be vastly higher, and does not remain static throughout pregnancy.\u00a0 \nThe changes of pregnancy are dynamic, with the stress on the heart increasing almost continuously.\u00a0It is unacceptable to have an arbitrary cutoff at 22 weeks where women and doctors are forced to let a tragic complication become a death sentence.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a physician, I can tell you we do not live in an ideal world where everyone has the same access to health care.\u00a0The women most likely to seek medical care late in pregnancy are those with the greatest medical need, the greatest barriers to care and the fewest resources.\u00a0These women are already our society\u2019s most vulnerable, and Proposition 115 will disproportionately burden and victimize them further.\nAll abortion restrictions put women\u2019s lives at risk. An overt goal of abortion bans is to shut down abortion clinics and punish or drive out physicians who provide abortion care. What is the sense in trying to drive off providers capable of providing critical health services?\u00a0 \n\nThe harm will not be limited to obstetrics, either.\u00a0Abortion bans make the states that pass them worse places to work for all providers.\u00a0They insert politics where it doesn\u2019t belong \u2014\u00a0 in the middle of the doctor-patient relationship.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am sure I am not the only physician in my specialty who does not want to work in that environment, and mine is not the only specialty outside of obstetrics that regularly addresses the intersection of chronic illness and pregnancy.\u00a0 Placing legal barriers to appropriate care in any field will drive away providers and cause harm to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are many more reasons to oppose Proposition 115, and I hope the voices of the women it would harm the most are heard the loudest.\u00a0However, I feel it is my duty as a physician to sound an alarm.\u00a0\u00a0\nProposition 115 would result in women dying.\u00a0Proposition 115 would result in worse medical care.\u00a0\u00a0\nLuckily, in November, we can reject this radical effort to harm women and health care in Colorado by voting \u201cno\u201d on Proposition 115.\n \n \n\n\nJames Monaco is a cardiologist practicing in the Denver metro area.\n\nThe Colorado Sun is a nonpartisan news organization, and the opinions of columnists and editorial writers do not reflect the opinions of the newsroom.
