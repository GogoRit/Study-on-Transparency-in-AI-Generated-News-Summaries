The \u201cUnsafe Abortion Protection Act,\u201d authored by State Senator, Katrina Jackson, an African-American, pro-life Democrat, received broad bipartisan support. The court ruled it unconstitutional in a split majority.\u00a0\nThe ruling comes four years after the Court\u2019s 2016 decision in, Whole Women\u2019s Health vs. Hellerstedt, a similar case in which the Court ruled that a Texas law violated its 1992 \u201ccompromise\u201d ruling in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey which stipulated that the State may not enact laws that place an obstacle to a women seeking an abortion. In Hellerstedt, the majority went on to write that the courts ought to weigh the burdens and benefits of laws that may impact abortion access.\u00a0\nNotable was the Court\u2019s extension of Casey\u2019s \u201cundue burden\u201d to abortion providers. In other words, the Court ruled that the Texas health and safety law posed an undue burden on doctors, and therefore on women. Thus the Court extended the undue burden clause from the woman seeking an abortion to the medical providers performing abortion.\u00a0\nMonday\u2019s ruling was something of a reprise of the Court\u2019s ruling four years ago, but it has at least two distinct features. First, unlike Texas, in Louisiana all physicians at ambulatory surgical centers are currently required to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital, except for abortion providers. Such privileges, as Justice Alito points out in his dissent, require a significantly higher standard of oversight than state medical licensing standards. Therefore, what might be perceived as unduly burdensome for abortion providers, is in fact a standard widely applied to other medical service providers statewide. The Louisiana law also did not criminalize violations of its health and safety law or stipulate additional safety requirements such as those the Court deemed unduly burdensome for abortion providers in Hellerstedt.\u00a0\nSecond, this was the first major abortion-related decision in the newly configured Court, widely viewed as test case for how the recent appointments of Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch would influence the Court\u2019s reasoning on abortion-related laws. In 2016, Justice Anthony Kennedy tipped the eight-justice court, concurring with Justices Ginsberg, Sotomayor, Breyer, and Kegan in striking down the Texas law, ruling that it was unconstitional because it places a \u201csubstantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion.\u201d\u00a0\nThe split majority argued that the Louisiana law places an unconstitutional burden on women seeking an abortion. In a departure from ordinary jurisprudence, in both cases the plaintiffs are abortion providers, not women seeking access to abortion. That is, an institutional body\u2014in this case abortionists\u2014which has a vested financial self-interest in preventing health and safety standards from taking effect, petitioned the court not because its rights are being violated, but rather under the auspices of a women\u2019s constitutional right to abortion.\u00a0\nJustice Alito, authoring the minority\u2019s dissenting opinion, marveled at the idea that abortion providers are permitted to invoke the right of a third party (women seeking an abortion) in order to attack legislation enacted to protect women\u2019s health. \u201cGiven the apparent conflict of interest,\u201d he observed, \u201cthat concept would be rejected out of hand in a case not involving abortion.\u201d Despite this jurisprudential irregularity and despite the formal and material differences between the Louisiana\u2019s statute in contrast to Texas\u2019s, Justice Breyer, writing the plurality opinion concluded that the law nevertheless \u201cimposes \u2018undue burden\u2019 on a women\u2019s constitutional right to choose to have an abortion\u201d and therefore violates the Constitution.\u00a0\nWhat truly puzzled both pro-life and abortion rights advocates, however, was Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s concurrence with the majority. His decision in support of June Medical Services was surprising because four years ago he dissented in Hellerstedt. Roberts, known for his concern for institutional integrity of the Court among an increasingly volatile and fragmented populace, wrote in favor of the decision but on significantly narrower grounds.\u00a0\nAs legal scholar Erika Bachiochi astutely points out, Roberts\u2019s ruling does not indicate a change in position. In ruling with the majority he was not only in the position to assign the majority opinion to Justice Breyer rather than, say, Justice Ginsburg, but also undermine the reasoning operative in the plurality opinion. In the course of his concurrence, Roberts reaffirms his dissenting opinion in Hellerstedt and repudiates the majority\u2019s reading of Casey\u2019s undue burden standard as a balancing of burdens and benefits.\u00a0\nRoberts argues that when read in isolation from its wider context in Casey, which stipulates the State\u2019s \u201cimportant and legitimate interests . . . in protecting the health of the pregnant woman and in protecting the potentiality of human life,\u201d the undue burden standard invites the \u201cmysterious\u201d weighing of benefits and burdens which would require justices \u201cto act as legislators, not judges.\u201d Such a cost/benefit analysis, he argues, is province of state and federal legislatures, not the courts. Concurring with the four dissenting justices, Roberts points out that in Casey the Court adjudicated restrictions, such as informed consent and mandatory waiting periods, in terms of whether they pose \u201csubstantial obstacles,\u201d not \u201cwhether the benefits outweighed the burdens.\u201d\u00a0\nIf Roberts\u2019s concurring opinion substantively disagrees with the plurality opinion, one might reasonably puzzle over his ruling. Why in Monday\u2019s case did he rule as he did, if he remains convinced of Hellerstedt\u2019s erroneous interpretation of Casey? Roberts\u2019s concurrence hinges on the doctrine of stare decisis, the Latin phrase meaning, \u201cto stand by things decided.\u201d It is the \u201clegal term for fidelity to precedent\u201d that \u201crequires us, absent special circumstances to treat like cases alike.\u201d Such respect for judicial precedent is vital for any democracy, as it maintains legal stability and curtails judicial capriciousness and partisanship.\u00a0\nFor Roberts the issue at stake was not whether the decision in Hellerstedt was right or wrong, \u201cbut whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case.\u201d\u00a0Thus while repudiating the reasoning employed in Hellerstedt, Roberts upheld the ruling on the formal principle of precedent, concluding that, \u201cthe Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons.\u201d Stare decisis, however, is not an incontrovertible principle, and indeed, Roberts himself has deviated from it on different occasions.\u00a0\nAs a self-corrective institution, the Court is required to remediate its errors. If its decision in Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt was wrong, it ought to correct its mistake, as it has done over the course of America\u2019s volatile 250-year history. How long must women\u2019s health be sacrificed on the altar of abortion?\nAt one level, Monday\u2019s case is not about woman\u2019s constitutional right to abortion. It was doctors and not women who sued the state, after all. At a deeper level, however, Russo has everything to do with American abortion law and its internal incoherence which, as Justice Thomas explains has its genesis in Roe v. Wade\u2019s creation of \u201cthe right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitution\u2019s text.\u201d\u00a0\nRather than correcting itself in 1992, the so-called compromise of Planned Parenthood v. Casey had the effect of further convoluting abortion jurisprudence and perpetuating the fiction that abortion is anything more than a specious imitation of freedom, which pathologizes womens\u2019 bodies and dictates the terms of equality on the basis of male womblessness.\u00a0\nSetting to the side its blatant anti-Catholicism, the old abortion rights counterfactual sloganeering that \u201cif men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament,\u201d might better be expressed as \u201cbecause men cannot get pregnant, abortion is a sacrament.\u201d If men could get pregnant, surely they would insist on something better than being vacuumed out and sent on their way. Surely they would demand comprehensive health care, affordable childcare, and extended parental leave policies. If men could get pregnant, would they not demand something better than abortion?\u00a0\n\n\nFeatured Image: Schwangere Maria, Fragment eines Altarfl\u00fcgels aus einer Feldkapelle in Cham, 1505; Source: Wikimedia Commons, PD-Old-100.\n\n\nPosted in Pro-Life\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\nJessica Keating\nJessica Keating is the director of the Notre Dame Office of Human Dignity and Life Initiatives, where she engages in scholarship that strives to recover the concept of human dignity for the theological and philosophical imagination.\nRead more by Jessica Keating\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Article\nThe Gift of Blackness to the Church: An Interview with EWTN\u2019s Gloria Purvis\n\n\nNext Article\nThe Steep Cost of Superdevelopment to the Environment and Human Dignity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Steep Cost of Superdevelopment to the Environment and Human Dignity\n\n\n\nJuly 02, 2020 |\n        David Lantigua\n\n\nDavid Lantigua\u00a0on the steep cost of superdevelopment to human dignity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeArticlesLatest by CategoryArchiveContributorsAboutSubscribe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024\n            University of Notre Dame\n\n\nMcGrath Institute for Church Life\nChurch Life Journal\nNotre Dame, IN 46556 USA\n\nAccessibility Information\n\n Facebook\n Instagram\n X/Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
