At that instant, the story goes, the flock of believers arose in protest and threw their support to the party of \u201cLife\u201d now known as the Republican Party. The implication is that the movement, in its current form, finds its principal motivation in the desire to protect fetuses against the women who would refuse to carry them to term.\nThis story is worse than myth. It is false as history and incorrect as analysis. Christian nationalism drew its inspiration from a set of concerns that long predated the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade and had little to do with abortion. The movement settled on abortion as its litmus test sometime after that decision for reasons that had more to do with politics than embryos. It then set about changing the religion of many people in the country in order to serve its new political ambitions. From the beginning, the \u201cabortion issue\u201d has never been just about abortion. It has also been about dividing and uniting to mobilize votes for the sake of amassing political power.\n*\nOn a crisp morning in January 2018, tens of thousands of marchers throng the National Mall in the annual March for Life. The crowd tilts female and young, and the overwhelming majority is white. A good number are clustered in church or campus youth groups and facing down the cold with parkas and Uggs or duck boots to protect their feet from the chill.\nI spot a young woman I\u2019ll call Megan in a placard-wielding group near the corner of Constitution and Fifteenth Street. Wearing a gray knitted pom-pom hat over light brown curls, she is marching with other members of a pro-life group at her college, where she majors in English. I first met her several years ago at a gathering of young antiabortion activists, where she was taking copious notes on a laptop plastered with stickers: \u201cCru,\u201d \u201cA Child Not a Choice.\u201d Finding her here, though unanticipated, is not terribly surprising. With her cheery disposition and uncomplicated certainty of her views, Megan seems to embody the ideal that Phyllis Schlafly, a godmother of the antiabortion movement and founder of the conservative interest group the Eagle Forum, famously advertised in the title of one of her books: The Power of the Positive Woman.\n\u201cWe are radicals who want to change the existing power structure.\u201d\nThat ideal lives on in the movement leaders today, including Penny Young Nance, president and CEO of Concerned Women for America, who made waves in recent years with her opposition to the Disney movie Frozen (it\u2019s anti-male) and, more recently, the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the #MeToo movement. Glamorous and effusive, she is true to the title of her recent book, Feisty and Feminine: A Rallying Cry for Conservative Women. \u201cWe expect to devote considerable resources to this effort, and we expect to win,\u201d said Nance, commenting on the appointment of prolife Supreme Court justices. \u201cOur happy warrior/activist ladies relish the fight and shine in these historic moments.\u201d\nLike other young activists at the march today, Megan is being groomed for glory in the conservative movement. As a convivial high school student, she was inspired by a friend to join a local chapter of Students for Life of America. Over a summer Megan attended the Young America\u2019s Foundation\u2019s National Conservative Student Conference in Washington, D.C., where, along with some 1,000 other students, she learned from speakers like Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Ben Shapiro about the importance of traditional values, free markets, and the left\u2019s assault on free speech.\nMegan, like other \u201cstudent leaders\u201d at the event, also received media coaching, including tips on crafting op-eds and appearing on camera. She hopes her networking will soon pay off in the form of a post-graduation internship at a right-wing policy organization. The Heritage Foundation, for instance, offers subsidized housing and free lunch\u2014a sweet gig for an English major. \u201cWhen I was younger, I never imagined I could be on TV,\u201d Megan says with confidence. \u201cNow I know I can.\u201d\nAs I\u2019m chatting with Megan, Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, takes the stage and the crowd erupts in a roar of joy. \u201cJeanne! Jeanne!\u201d Megan\u2019s voice joins the collective thunder. Mancini previously worked for the Family Research Council, and before that on behalf of the Catholic Church.\nSpeaker after speaker follow onstage to condemn abortion and offer messages of praise for \u201cthe most pro-life president in history!\u201d With the exception of Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, whose mother is white and father is Mexican American, every speaker at the 2018 March for Life rally program appears to be white.\nDonald Trump at last appears on a giant television screen live via satellite from the White House Rose Garden. The crowd greets the supersize image with enthusiasm, and it is clear that many believe that God, acting through the pro-life movement, put Trump in the White House. The president declares that the marchers are \u201ca truly remarkable group\u201d and then runs through a list of his own amazing achievements in office. \u201cOn the National Day of Prayer, I signed an executive order to protect religious liberty,\u201d he says. He is referring to a declaration that, as Rob Boston, senior advisor for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State aptly put it, amounts to \u201cone more attempt . . . to redefine religious freedom to mean the freedom to discriminate against those who do not share our religious belief.\u201d The crowd bursts into applause, and Trump nods his head, smiling. \u201cVery proud of that.\u201d\nI watch Megan watching Trump. It\u2019s as if I can see the lines of power traced in her eyes. But when I ask her what she makes of the fact that Protestants by and large did not oppose abortion rights fifty years ago, and neither did many Republicans, she gives me a blank look. \u201cChristianity is pro-life,\u201d she says with certainty. \u201cRepublicans are the party of life.\u201d\nThe annual scene on the mall, though familiar enough by now to count as reaffirmation rather than protest, serves mainly to drive home the brute fact that, for Republican politicians, abortion demagoguery is the path to power in America. Donald Trump clearly grasped that fact. Most of the people here, like most of the people catching snippets of the event on the evening news, take for granted that it is the way things have always been.\nExcept that it isn\u2019t.\nIn the late 1970s a curious combination of religious and political activists assembled to ponder the strategy of a new political movement, sometimes by letter or phone, and sometimes in conference rooms or at a hotel in Lynchburg, Virginia. Some of the more vocal members of the group included Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell; conservative activists Ed McAteer and Paul Weyrich; Nixon appointee Howard Phillips; attorney Alan P. Dye; and Robert J. Billings, an educator and organizer who would later serve as Ronald Reagan\u2019s liaison to the Christian right.\nThis was an angry group of men. \u201cWe are radicals who want to change the existing power structure. We are not conservatives in the sense that conservative means accepting the status quo,\u201d Paul Weyrich said. \u201cWe want change\u2014we are the forces of change.\u201d They were angry at liberals, who threatened to undermine national security with their unforgivable softness on communism; they were angry at the establishment conservatives, the Rockefeller Republicans, for siding with the liberals and taking down their hero, Barry Goldwater; they were angry about the rising tide of feminism, which they saw as a menace to the social order; and about the civil rights movement and the danger it posed to segregation, especially in education. One thing that they were not particularly angry about, at least at the start of their discussions, was the matter of abortion rights.\nFrom the beginning, the New Right sought radical change. They would establish themselves \u201cfirst as the opposition, then the alternative, finally the government.\u201d\nWeyrich was \u201cthe man perhaps with the broadest vision,\u201d according to his fellow conservative activist Richard Viguerie. \u201cI can think of no one who better symbolizes or is more important to the conservative movement.\u201d In matters of religion, Weyrich was personally conservative: he abandoned the Roman Catholic Church, which he believed had become too liberal, for the Melkite Greek Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council. But his politics weren\u2019t necessarily centered on religion. He formed his political creed as a twenty-something in the Barry Goldwater uprising of 1964, and it consisted of visceral anticommunism, economic libertarianism, and a distrust of the civil rights movement. Jimmy Carter\u2019s famous religiosity did nothing to redeem him in Weyrich\u2019s eyes. Indeed, in 1978 and 1979, Weyrich\u2019s immediate priority was to make sure that Carter would be a one-term president.\nWeyrich began to identify himself in the late 1970s with a movement whose name Richard Viguerie put on the title of his 1980 manifesto: The New Right: We\u2019re Ready to Lead. Weyrich came to be known as the \u201cevil genius\u201d of the movement\u2014or sometimes \u201cthe Lenin of social conservatism\u201d\u2014and Viguerie, who is considered the pioneer of political direct mail, came to be known as its \u201cfunding father.\u201d\nFrom the beginning, the New Right sought radical change. They would establish themselves \u201cfirst as the opposition, then the alternative, finally the government,\u201d according to Conservative Caucus chair Howard Phillips. \u201cWe will not try to reform the existing institutions. We only intend to weaken them and eventually destroy them,\u201d said Weyrich prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Eric Heubeck, writing for the Free Congress Foundation. \u201cWe will maintain a constant barrage of criticism against the Left. We will attack the very legitimacy of the Left. We will not give them a moment\u2019s rest . . . We will use guerrilla tactics to undermine the legitimacy of the dominant regime.\u201d\nWeyrich went on to call for a constitutional convention in hopes of producing a form of government more congenial to conservatism. \u201cI don\u2019t want everybody to vote,\u201d he said at a gathering in the fall of 1980. \u201cAs a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\u201d 14 Richard Viguerie emphatically endorsed Weyrich\u2019s radicalism, which in turn led both men to adopt a kind of experimental pragmatism in pursuing their ends. \u201cOne of the major differences in this group of new conservatives was that we weren\u2019t afraid to try even when there was only a 20 per cent chance of success,\u201d Viguerie wrote. \u201cWe knew that if you expected to hit a lot of home runs, you had to expect to strike out a lot.\u201d\nAt the core of the concerns of the New Right was the perception that American capitalism was under dire threat from mortal enemies\u2014some of them internal, some external, most of them communist. \u201cLiberal national defense policies have resulted in the United States, long the world\u2019s strongest military power, falling behind Soviet Russia in every major area of conventional and strategic weaponry,\u201d wrote Viguerie.\nActivist Phyllis Schlafly shared Viguerie\u2019s obsession with the communist menace. In the 1950s she wrote, \u201cThe plain facts are that Communism is advancing over the surface of the globe with such rapidity that if it continues at the same rate for the next thirteen years that it has been advancing during the past thirteen years, America will be Communist by 1970.\u201d But Schlafly also gave voice to another motivating concern of the emerging right-wing consensus: the specter of feminism. Schlafly rose to prominence in her campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment. The feminist movement, she asserted, \u201cis the most destructive element in our society.\u201d\nFor Weyrich and his fellow political operatives, the rise of the civil rights movement presented a historic opportunity to advance their own agenda. From Reconstruction through the 1960s, southern whites had been a critical part of the Democratic Party coalition. Their support had been essential in realizing the New Deal, although it burdened the progressive legislation of the period with racist policies. When Democrats took the lead in civil rights, however, the southern white population was suddenly in play. Nixon famously committed the Republican Party to the \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d\u2014 that is, appealing to the southern, white, formerly Democratic popular vote through populism, racism, and nativism. This in turn created a tension with the Republican Party\u2019s other base, the so-called Rockefeller Republicans, who consisted, on balance, of economic conservatives with largely moderate social views.\nAs the Lynchburg crowd commenced their conversations, Weyrich had already formulated a general idea for an electoral strategy that would take the New Right from opposition to power. He had studied the successes of the left in the 1960s and 1970s, and now he thought he knew what the left had that the right lacked: the right needed to get religion. The left had successfully appealed to religious feelings and organizations in forming the coalition that advanced civil rights, promoted Great Society programs, and opposed the Vietnam War. Just as reformers around the turn of the century had deployed the Social Gospel on behalf of progressive causes, Martin Luther King Jr. has used his pulpit to mobilize change. If the right could access the religious vote, Weyrich reasoned, power would be in its grasp. Together with Phillips, he devoted \u201ccountless hours cultivating electronic ministers like Jerry Falwell, Jim [James] Robison, and Pat Robertson, urging them to get involved in conservative politics,\u201d according to Viguerie.\nWeyrich eventually founded or played a critical role in a number of prominent groups on the right. They included the Heritage Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and the Free Congress Foundation. Arguably the most consequential of the groups Weyrich played a role in founding was the Council for National Policy, a networking organization for social conservative activists that the New York Times once referred to as a \u201clittle-known group of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country.\u201d\nWeyrich did not act alone. Other cofounders and early members of the CNP included Tim LaHaye (then head of Moral Majority), billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell. A leaked 2014 membership directory of the CNP, posted on the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center, shines a spotlight on this powerful subsection of the reactionary right. The directory includes Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, and the National Rifle Association\u2019s Wayne LaPierre; Christian right leaders such as Tony Perkins, Ralph Reed, and James Dobson; and antiabortion advocates Phyllis Schlafly, Penny Nance, and Kristan Hawkins. The group also brought into the fold leaders of right-wing economic policy groups and media conglomerates; masterminds of the right-wing legal movement including Alan Sears, Jay Sekulow, and Leonard Leo; and various members of the DeVos and Prince families, including Betsy DeVos\u2019s brother Erik Prince and her husband, Richard, who served as president twice. \u201cThe Council for National Policy went on to assemble an impressive network of media and organizations that worked to advance their cause, with a special focus on mobilizing the fundamentalist vote in key districts,\u201d says Anne Nelson, author of Shadow Network: Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right.\n__________________________________\n\nFrom The Power Worshippers by Katherine Stewart.
