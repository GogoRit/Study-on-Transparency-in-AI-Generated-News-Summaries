It was about 10 days after a pro-life statewide referendum had failed.\nShe was among about a dozen undergraduates taking part in a campus Catholic center formation exercise: walking along the busy major thoroughfare of the city trying to see people they passed the way God the Father sees them.\n\u201cIt was making my heart sad. I had a feeling Jesus was saying, \u2018I love you, but I want you to see how life is valued, and this life that I have given you is so, so precious,\u2019\u201d Starnes said in a telephone interview with the Register.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatewide, the referendum lost by 18 points. In Douglas County, where Lawrence is, the margin was 82%-18% against it. Sentiment is similar at the University of Kansas, a public research university in Lawrence with about 24,000 students.\nStarnes\u2019 experience illustrates a problem for pro-life students and chaplains on secular college campuses: How do you bring a pro-life message to a place where most people don\u2019t want to hear it?\n\u00a0\nAbortion Entrenched\nPost-Dobbs, the June 24 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion is now illegal in some states. But many abortion supporters are now more dug in than ever. \u201cPeople are just as hostile to pro-life [messages] as they were last year, but now there\u2019s probably an uptick in motivation,\u201d said Juan Pablo Moreland, 19, a sophomore at the University of Southern California who is active in pro-life activities.\nMoreland is trying to make inroads. He helped found a non-religious pro-life group this past spring called Trojans for Life. He also leads missions for the campus Catholic center, which includes pro-life ministry. And he was one of about 20 students who attended the OneLife LA pro-life march this past January, and he attended a Mass last semester during which members of the Sisters of Life made a presentation encouraging students to create a culture of life and respect for pregnant women.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, he\u2019s one Trojan in a big stadium on this issue.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a few conversations with people who have told me I\u2019m the first openly pro-life person they\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Moreland, a philosophy major from a Philadelphia suburb.\nOpposition comes not just from outside the Catholic center, but also from students within it, he said. \u201cI do get the sense among Catholics that they don\u2019t want to embrace that part of our ministry.\u201d\nThe disconnection between faith and action can be seen in Catholic students who go to a pro-abortion Women\u2019s March on a Saturday and then come to Mass at the Catholic center on Sunday, said Father Richard Sunwoo, pastor of Our Savior parish and the USC Caruso Catholic Center in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while pro-lifers see ending Roe v. Wade as necessary and a cause for hope, it hasn\u2019t bridged many gaps.\n\u201cIf anything, the Dobbs decision made clearer the growing divide between pro-abortion and pro-life advocates,\u201d Father Sunwoo said by email. \u201cI have had some really great conversations where pro-life ideas are gaining ground, but this is going to be a very long moral battle to win hearts and minds.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHelping Hands\nWhile abortion remains legal and common in California, it\u2019s now illegal in Texas. Yet the law is only one piece in a pro-life puzzle. Since more women in Texas aren\u2019t getting abortions, there are more women carrying problem pregnancies.\nAt Texas A&M, the goal of the Catholic ministry at the university is to identify them and get them the help they need. \u201cOur approach this fall, after the overturning of Roe v. Wade this summer, is a focus on helping moms who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy. There are a lot of great resources to help in this area, and our desire is to be a bridge between the mom and the groups and agencies who can help them with setting up adoption or choosing to raise the child,\u201d said Father Will Straten, pastor of the university-affiliated St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Center in College Station, in an email message to the Register. \u201cWe also want to give this information to our students \u2014 many times, moms in unwanted pregnancies first turn to their peers for answers and guidance. We hope to do this by equipping our campus ministers, who have the most contact with our students.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is also now illegal in Missouri. In Columbia, where the University of Missouri\u2019s flagship campus is, the local Planned Parenthood business (which is currently temporarily closed) hasn\u2019t performed abortions since 2018.\nWith the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Father Dan Merz, pastor of St. Thomas More Catholic Church and Newman Center in Columbia, said he is hoping to foster \u201ca quiet dialogue\u201d on abortion and other hot-button issues, in hopes to form trust and enable candid conversations. \u201cI believe a Catholic parish located on the campus of a major university is well placed to be a venue for dialogue and a deeper conversation,\u201d Father Merz said in an email message. He is also raising money to create a \u201cdirector of service and justice\u201d position, designed to promote corporal and spiritual works of mercy and to serve as a liaison to charitable and pro-life groups, among other things.\n\u201cI would certainly hope that one of the benefits of having this be a full-time position is the promotion of a culture of life (at all stages of development), and a culture of compassion,\u201d Father Merz said.\n\u00a0\nHuman Dignity\nBuilding a culture of life requires emphasizing \u201cthe Catholic understanding of the dignity of every human person \u2014 that we are worth saving and loving in the eyes of God,\u201d said Father Jake Anderson, pastor and director of St. Lawrence Catholic Church and Newman Center in Minneapolis, which serves the University of Minnesota.\n\u201cWe do regular teachings on the dignity of the person and seek to eradicate the spiritual poverty present in many modern minds that our worth is in what we achieve and not what we receive,\u201d Father Anderson said in an email message.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t come primarily from imparting information, but rather from building relationships among students that differ from \u201cwhat they experience elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWithin the community here at the Newman Center, we have many young people living in common and have a shared way of life \u2026 prayer, worship, laughter, discipline, formation of the mind. \u2026 [A]ll of this is rooted in the encounter with Christ,\u201d Father Anderson said.\u00a0 \nA student prays at St. Lawrence Catholic Church at the University of Minnesota. | Courtesy of St. Lawrence Catholic Church  \n\n\u201cThis encounter happens for many of them at our fall retreat. If a student comes on fall retreat, the odds are heavily favoring them being \u2018caught\u2019 by attraction to Jesus, the Eucharist and the whole Catholic life. We can teach people all we want (and this is good), but until they are caught, the teaching does not go very far against the grain of a relentless culture of individualism and the enthronement of self-will.\u201d\n\u00a0\nConfronting Sadness\nThe recent referendum vote in Kansas led to harsh confrontations. A pro-life Catholic college student going door-to-door reported being knocked down by a resident in Leawood on July 31, leading to an arrest on a misdemeanor battery charge.\nOpposition to pro-lifers has typically been less dramatic at the University of Kansas, but still at times pointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur students who use the Catholic center have reported being shamed quite a bit by their peers leading up to the primary vote,\u201d said Father Mitchel Zimmerman, director and chaplain of the St. Lawrence Catholic Campus Center, which serves University of Kansas students. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re one of them.\u2019\u201d\nFather Zimmerman didn\u2019t sugarcoat the decisive pro-abortion victory in the state on Aug. 2.\n\u201cI think it was very revealing, kind of where we are \u2014 putting the rights of adults, and personal autonomy and privacy, and to put yourself, first,\u201d Father Zimmerman told the Register in a telephone interview. \u201c\u2026 The Catholic worldview is not dominant \u2014 and in some ways, it\u2019s not even competitive.\u201d\nYet the Catholic center doesn\u2019t just run up the white flag.\u00a0\nFor students who come to Mass and take part in Catholic center activities such as monthly adoration, Father Zimmerman said: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to form them into being pro-life and what pro-life means.\u201d\nFor others, he wants to try to reach as many of the reachable as he can.\n\n\n\n\n\nFather Zimmerman puts students into five categories: Those who love the Catholic center and participate in it; those drifting away from the faith for no particular reason and open to being invited back (what he calls \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d); those raised Catholic but who have decided not to practice the faith; those who don\u2019t really know what the Catholic faith is; and those who hate the faith.\nThe Catholic center offers aggressive, if purposely non-threatening, outreach programs. One is called \u201cSlow Drip\u201d: Catholic students offer free coffee, pastries and bagels from 8 to 11am on Fridays to anyone who wants to join in eating and conversation.\nAnother is called \u201cGood Company\u201d \u2014 or Good Co, for short. The name is purposely un-Catholic-sounding. Students from the Catholic center invite people from outside their social circles to a small dinner, with food provided by the center. There\u2019s no hard sell, and biting political issues like abortion rarely, if ever, come up. But the idea is to make a connection with people who don\u2019t have one.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to fight that inoculation and isolation,\u201d Father Zimmerman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarnes, 20, a psychology major from Texas who is a member of Jayhawks for Life, sees Good Co as an indirect way of building a culture of life, simply by making people feel welcomed and loved.\nShe uses her outgoing personality to try to break through the gloom and the EarPods she often encounters on her way to class.\n\u201cThe majority of students on campus look super sad. They don\u2019t want to be here. It just hurts my heart,\u201d Starnes said.\u00a0\n\u201cAll of us are here for a reason, and I just want people to understand that.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \ncatholic college students\nnewman centers\nmatt mcdonald\n\n\n\n\nMatthew McDonald Matthew McDonald is a staff reporter for The National Catholic Register and the editor of New Boston Post.
