In the 90-minute talk, Ross addressed the origins of the term \u201creproductive justice,\u201d using a human rights framework to center the movement and its applicability to current and future reproductive health and social justice issues.\u00a0\nRoss is a visiting Women\u2019s Studies associate professor who started her career in activism and social change in the 1970s at the National Football League (NFL) Players Association. Since then, she has worked with high-profile reproductive justice groups, including the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, the National Organization for Women (NOW), the National Black Women\u2019s Health Project, the Center for Democratic Renewal (National Anti-Klan Network), the National Center for Human Rights Education and SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective. She retired as an organizer in 2012 to teach about activism.\nRoss\u2019s advocacy for reproductive rights is rooted in her personal experiences. At 14, she became a victim of rape and incest, and gave birth to a child before completing the tenth grade.\n\u201cThat was not the way I wanted to become a mother,\u201d Ross told the audience. \u201cBut back in 1968, abortion was not legal and there was no way to really terminate the pregnancy.\u201d\u00a0\nRoss had resolved to give her baby up for adoption, but changed her mind when she was handed her son for the first time in the hospital.\u00a0\n\u201cIn that moment, I went from pregnant person to a mother,\u201d she said. Though Ross had come to terms with her new role as a mother, her high school administration had not, and they banned her from coming back to school. She and her family sued the San Antonio school district for her right to return, and won the case.\u00a0\n\u201cThat was my first feminist act,\u201d Ross reflected. \u201cEven though I couldn\u2019t spell the term \u2018feminism\u2019 at the time, I knew that they did not expel the boys who made the girls pregnant, and that this was wrong.\u201d\nSince then, Ross has \u201cnever sat back and let injustice happen,\u201d instead delving into work with a variety of causes related to reproductive health and social justice.\u00a0\nHer pursuit of what is now termed reproductive justice started at a 1994 conference in Chicago among a group of 12 black women from different activist organizations. At the conference, a representative from the Democratic party encouraged attendees to support a healthcare reform plan that would minimize or omit reproductive healthcare as a strategy for getting Republican opponents on board. Upon hearing this, Ross and her colleagues knew they had to take action.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were frustrated that fighting for abortion rights was always isolated from all of the other social justice issues,\u201d Ross said. She explained that for many women, the experience of fearing pregnancy and feeling limited by resources was something that should be counted as a human rights issue. As a result, Ross and her colleagues decided they were going to address reproductive rights under this human rights framework. They meshed together \u201creproductive rights\u201d and \u201csocial justice\u201d to coin the term reproductive justice.\u00a0\n\u201cA lot of people think we created reproductive justice to counter the pro-choice movement,\u201d Ross told the audience. \u201cBut we did not. It was designed to talk about the human rights needs of black women in terms of reproductive justice.\u201d\u00a0\nRoss hypothesizes that the term was accepted to encompass the movement because of frustration with the limiting, binary nature of pro-choice versus pro-life. In contrast to this dichotomy, she refers to reproductive justice through a \u201cshifting lense\u201d concept, which can be applied to different communities and people based on their needs and vulnerabilities to oppression.\n\u201cWhen the Latina community started using reproductive justice, they used it to talk about immigration. When it was shifted to the Native American community, they talked about sovereignty,\u201d Ross said. She detailed how the movement is expansive enough that it ultimately ends up permeating so many aspects of society, such as the need for proper education or tax plans that do not discriminate against mothers.\nDue to the expansive nature of the movement, however, Ross admitted that it was often hard to fully capture and explain the term to others. As a result, she has worked to break down reproductive justice into three tenants: the right to not have kids, the right to have kids and give birth under desired conditions \u2014 which she emphasizes as vital for women of color due to eugenics and population control \u2014 and the right to raise children in safe and healthy environments. Ross would later add a fourth tenant: the right to gender identity and sexual autonomy.\u00a0\nThe group of twelve women first introduced the term \u201creproductive justice\u201d to the world at a conference of women of color and allies in 2003. Since then, Ross has seen it gain traction, and expressed hope that the movement would continue to grow.\n\u201cWe asked the question of whether reproductive justice was a sturdy enough framework for us to organize on, and those 600 women said, Hell yes,\u201d Ross said with a smile. \nContact Sarina Deb at sdeb7 \u2018at stanford.edu.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stanford Daily \n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\n UniversityAcademicsCampus LifeGraduate StudentsBusiness & TechnologyDataEquity Project \n\n\n\n\n\nSports \n\n\n\nFall SportsWinter SportsSpring Sports \n\n\n\nArts & Life \n\n\n\nScreenCultureMusicReads \n\n\n\n\n\nOpinions \n\n\n\nColumnistsEditorialsLetters from the EditorLetters to the EditorOp-Eds \n\n\n\nGrind \n\n\n\nHumor \n\n\n\n\n\nMultimedia \n\n\n\nVideoPodcastsCartoonsGraphicsTech \n\n\n\nMagazine \n\n\n\nArchives \n\n\n\n\n\nDEI \n\n\n\nResources \n\n\n\nAbout Us \n\n\n\nMasthead \n\n\n\nAlumni \n\n\n\nPrint Paper \n\n\n\n\n\nFollow \n\n\n\n \n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nLinkedin\n \n\n\n\nTiktok\n \n\n\n\nSpotify\n \n\n\n\nRss\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp-store-ios\n \n\n\n\nGoogle-play\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 THE STANFORD DAILY PUBLISHING CORPORATION \n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Accessibility \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Advertise \n\n\n\nProudly Powered by WordPress \n\n\n\nDonate and support The Daily when you shop on Amazon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nAcademics\nCampus Life\nData\nEquity Project\nGraduate Students\nScience & Technology\nUniversity\n\n\nSports\n\nFall Sports\n\nCross Country\nField Hockey\nFootball\nMen\u2019s Soccer\nMen\u2019s Water Polo\nWomen\u2019s Soccer\nWomen\u2019s Volleyball\n\n\nWinter Sports\n\nFencing\nMen\u2019s Basketball\nMen\u2019s Gymnastics\nMen\u2019s Swimming & Diving\nSquash\nWomen\u2019s Basketball\nWomen\u2019s Gymnastics\nWomen\u2019s Swimming & Diving\nArtistic Swimming\nWrestling\n\n\nSpring Sports\n\nBaseball\nBeach Volleyball\nLacrosse\nMen\u2019s Golf\nMen\u2019s Rowing\nMen\u2019s Tennis\nMen\u2019s Volleyball\nSailing\nSoftball\nTrack & Field\nWomen\u2019s Golf\nWomen\u2019s Lightweight Rowing\nWomen\u2019s Rowing\nWomen\u2019s Tennis\nWomen\u2019s Water Polo\n\n\nColumnists\nFeatures\n\n\nOpinions\n\nColumnists\nEditorials\nLetters to the Editor\nLetters to the Community\n\n\nArts & Life\n\nCulture\nMusic\nReads\nScreen\n\n\nGrind\nHumor\nData\nCartoons\nPodcasts\nVideo\nMagazine\nArchive\n \n\n\n\nMore\n\nAbout Us\nTips\nSubmit Work\nDEI\nAds\nAlumni\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nAcademics\nCampus Life\nData\nEquity Project\nGraduate Students\nScience & Technology\nUniversity\n\n\nSports\n\nFall Sports\n\nCross Country\nField Hockey\nFootball\nMen\u2019s Soccer\nMen\u2019s Water Polo\nWomen\u2019s Soccer\nWomen\u2019s Volleyball\n\n\nWinter Sports\n\nFencing\nMen\u2019s Basketball\nMen\u2019s Gymnastics\nMen\u2019s Swimming & Diving\nSquash\nWomen\u2019s Basketball\nWomen\u2019s Gymnastics\nWomen\u2019s Swimming & Diving\nArtistic Swimming\nWrestling\n\n\nSpring Sports\n\nBaseball\nBeach Volleyball\nLacrosse\nMen\u2019s Golf\nMen\u2019s Rowing\nMen\u2019s Tennis\nMen\u2019s Volleyball\nSailing\nSoftball\nTrack & Field\nWomen\u2019s Golf\nWomen\u2019s Lightweight Rowing\nWomen\u2019s Rowing\nWomen\u2019s Tennis\nWomen\u2019s Water Polo\n\n\nColumnists\nFeatures\n\n\nOpinions\n\nColumnists\nEditorials\nLetters to the Editor\nLetters to the Community\n\n\nArts & Life\n\nCulture\nMusic\nReads\nScreen\n\n\nGrind\nHumor\nData\nCartoons\nPodcasts\nVideo\nMagazine\nArchive\n \n\n\n\nMore\n\nAbout Us\nTips\nSubmit Work\nDEI\nAds\nAlumni\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stanford Daily \n\n\n\nLogin or create an account \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername or Email Address *Password Remember Me\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister | Lost your password?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUsername or Email Address \n\n\nPassword \n\n\n\n\nRemember Me \n\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\n\nLost your password? \n | \n\nRegister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
