It means on average every Ugandan woman can have five children. It's more than double the global average of 2.4 children and there is concern Uganda's population is likely to hit 55 million by 2025.\u00a0\"We want to have universal access to quality integrated sexual and reproductive health services and rights for women and young people in Uganda.\"\u00a0\n\nUNFPA Uganda Country Representative Alain Sibenaler addressing a high-level political endorsement seminar for the 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025.\n\n\"We are targeting key beneficiaries including young people, women, adolescents, refugees, ethnic minorities and hard to reach communities, plus migrants,\" says Sibenaler.\u00a0He says through the targeted group UNFPA and the government wants to have reduced teenage pregnancy and child marriages, reduced unmet need for family planning, and reduced maternal deaths. \u00a0\"These are the key ingredients to reduced fertility. We are not saying you should have a certain number of children but we know that if children are not being married before they are 18, when the girls stay in school, it automatically reduces the high fertility of families,\" he says.\u00a0Sibenaler said together with the government UNFPA is aiming at all vulnerable and marginalised groups having equitable access to the utilisation of quality basic social and protection services.\u00a0\"We are building three systems health, education, and protection system.\"\u00a0\"It means we want access to services, utilization and information of the services to make informed choices which include sexuality education by Ministry of Education and Sports, and capacity to reduce and respond to GBV and harmful practices.\"\u00a0\"These are basic human rights for women and girls to thrive throughout life and we are delivering that right in an integrated package wherever we are present in the country,\" says Sibenaler.\u00a0The UN Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango says the new 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025 is fully aligned to the UN profession framework and it's sufficient to support the implementation of the National Development Plan III, Vision 2040, and the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030.\u00a0\"By 2025 vulnerable and marginalised people will have improved equitable access, to quality social services and protection,\" she says.\u00a0The previous status\u00a0The Director General of Uganda's National Population Council (NPC) says previously there was high mortality and fertility.\u00a0\"We had too many people dying and also very many births, right now death is declining, infant mortality has come down tremendously, and the country even achieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target replaced now by SDGs.\" \u00a0\"Even fertility is starting to come down. This creates an opportunity where we can change our population age structure that had many young children who are dependants and create a lot of pressure on government social services, to a less dependent bigger working population.\u00a0\"If they are healthy, educated, with jobs they can be the engine of growth,\" says Dr. Musinguzi.\u00a0\n\nUN Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango says the new 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025 is fully aligned to the UN profession framework.\n\nManaging the Impact of COVID-19\u00a0The Minister of State for\u00a0\u00a0Finance\u00a0and Economic Development\u00a0David Bahati says the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID 19) pauses a threat to gains made in providing sexual and reproductive health services and rights for women and girls, \u00a0He says the impact of COVID-19 could negatively affect the country's progress towards consolidating economic growth brought by change in the age structure of the country resulting from a rapid decline in fertility and mortality rates that is shifting the population structure\u00a0\u00a0from one dominated by dependent children to that dominated by economically productive working adults.\u00a0\"The increasing number of girls that may not join school again due to pregnancy related challenges brought about by COVID 19 and increasing GBV, loss of income due to the closure of businesses, limited access to sexual and reproductive health services are among the urgent issues that directly impact young people that we have to address.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is, therefore, good to note that the new Country Programme has taken into consideration the possible impact of COVID-19 and will prioritise mitigation measures as part of continued support to the national COVID-19 Response Plan,\" says Bahati.\u00a0Government commitment\u00a0The first commitment was the recent passing by the cabinet of the National population policy, says Dr Musinguzi\u00a0The Minister of State for Foreign affairs Okello Oryem says the government is committed to continuing allocating annually at least 10% of the countries maternal and child health resource to adolescent friendly and reproductive health services, and elimination of obstacles that stand in the way of girl's empowerment including teenage pregnancies, child marriages as well as all forms of GBV.\u00a0In addition, the government has committed to the promotion of universal access to all methods of family planning and to reduce unmet need for family planning from 28% to 10 per cent by 2022.\u00a0\"Uganda has a challenge of very vulnerable communities and needs to address challenges regarding their reproductive health. We are committed to delivering these programmes,\" says Oryem.\u00a0\u00a0He also pledged government commitment to operationalising the National Sexuality Education Policy Framework that the Ministry of Education and Sports launched in 2018 to provide a formal national direction for sexuality education within Ugandan schools while upholding the positive cultural and religious value of the country.\u00a0Oryem says Uganda is committed\u00a0to placing individual dignity and human rights at the very heart of human development.\u00a0He pledged government commitment to prioritize human capital development, a key component of National Development Plan III, which\u00a0focuses\u00a0on sustainable industrialisation for inclusive growth employment and wealth creation in order to leave no one behind.\u00a0Oryem commended UNFPA for supporting Uganda in delivering SDG goals numbers 3, 4, 5, and 10.\u00a0All these are important goals that not only support the advancement of the Programme of Action (POA) of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) reached in Cairo, Egypt in 1994 but also impacts on the achievement of other SDGs.\u00a0Oryem says in Nairobi Kenya last year, President Yoweri Museveni committed to further advance the ICPD agenda\u00a0The Minister of State for Finance says as\u00a0an indication of its commitment to the partnership with UNFPA; government continues to make an annual voluntary contribution of $5,000 to UNFPA's core resources.\u00a0    \n        Link copied to clipboard\n\n        \n            Close\n           \n        Link not copied to clipboard\n\n        \n            Close\n                 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});         \n              All Rights Reserved \u00a9 NewVision\n              2024\n              \n                TV\n               \n                Archives\n               E-Papers Privacy Policy Legal Policy \n                Terms of Use\n               Contact us \n                +256 (0)414 337 000 \n                +256 (0)312 337 000 \n                news@newvision.co.ug     \n\n\n"
