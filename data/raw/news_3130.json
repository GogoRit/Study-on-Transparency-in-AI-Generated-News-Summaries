Anthony List Pro-Life Scorecard\nAs 49th Annual March for Life Takes Place Today, Grassley is Recognized for Strong Pro-Life Record\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Chuck Grassley\r\n(R-Iowa), a staunch defender of the right to life, has earned an A+ rating for 2021 on the Susan B. Anthony (SBA) List National Pro-Life\r\nScorecard. The scorecard takes into account the votes and actions of every\r\nlawmaker for the first session of the 117th Congress.SBA List cited Grassley\u2019s\r\nrecord of voting \u201cconsistently to defend the lives of the unborn and infants,\u201d\r\nincluding his unyielding efforts to speak out \u201cagainst extremist nominees of\r\nthe pro-abortion Biden-Harris administration.\u201d Specifically, they noted\r\nGrassley\u2019s aggressive questioning during Xavier Becerra\u2019s confirmation hearing\r\nto become secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). During the hearing,\r\nGrassley pressed\r\nBecerra on the need to prioritize protecting the unborn from late-term\r\nabortions.\u201cI am proud of my strong record of\r\nstanding up for the most vulnerable among us: the unborn. The fundamental right\r\nto life is afforded to all people, both born and unborn. In fact, the right to\r\nlife is so significant that our Founding Fathers wrote it in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence\u00a0 \u2013 all human beings are\r\nendowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, including the right\r\nto life. I\u2019ll continue fighting to uphold the sanctity of all human life,\u201d Grassley said.Last year, Grassley also joined his\r\npro-life colleagues in committing to block any bill that undermines Hyde Amendment protections, which\r\nensure taxpayer dollars are not allowed to be spent on abortions.View Grassley\u2019s SBA List scorecard by\r\nclicking here. \n-30-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nLike\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Previous Article\n            \n\n\n\n              Next Article\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            About\n          \n\n\n\n            News\n          \n\n\n\n            Contact\n          \n\n\n\n            Services\n          \n\n\n\n            Privacy Policy\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Grassley Medium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnav-mobile-modal\n\nnav-mobile-modal close button\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              About\n            \n\n\n                      Service\n                    \n\n                      Biography\n                    \n\n                      Results\n                    \n\n                      Voting Record\n                    \n\n                      Legislation\n                    \n\n\n              News\n            \n\n\n                      News Releases\n                    \n\n                      Remarks\n                    \n\n                      Commentary\n                    \n\n                      Official Correspondence\n                    \n\n                      History Series\n                    \n\n                      Press Kit\n                    \n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n                      Questions & Comments\n                    \n\n                      Help with Federal Agencies\n                    \n\n                      Request a Meeting\n                    \n\n                      Get the Scoop\n                    \n\n                      Whistleblowers\n                    \n\n\n              Services\n            \n\n\n                      Help with Federal Agencies\n                    \n\n                      Questions & Comments\n                    \n\n                      Request a Meeting\n                    \n\n                      Visiting Washington, D.C.\n                    \n\n                      Flag Requests\n                    \n\n                      Grants\n                    \n\n                      Academy Nominations\n                    \n\n                      Internships\n                    \n\n                      Teachers & Students\n                    \n\n                      Women's Advisory Council\n                    \n\n                      Veterans Fellowship Program\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch-mobile-modal\n\nsearch-mobile-modal close button\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
