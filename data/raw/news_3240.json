Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.\nThe left claims to care about women\u2019s health, but the Democrat-controlled committee stacked the witnesses 5 to 1 in favor of\u00a0abortion on demand.\u00a0Dr. Christina Francis, CEO-elect of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, held her own as the sole pro-life representative.\nFrancis rebutted false claims that state pro-life laws are preventing doctors from treating ectopic pregnancies. \u00a0\nPregnancy begins when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of a woman\u2019s uterus. In an ectopic pregnancy, the egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube.\nThat tragic\u2014but rare\u2014event puts the mother\u2019s life in\u00a0grave danger. It occurs in 1% to 2% of pregnancies, but is responsible for 4% to 10% of maternal deaths. Untreated, it can cause the fallopian tube to rupture, which ends the life of the baby and likely the mother as well.\nTreating an ectopic pregnancy is different from having an abortion. Abortion is an intentional, unnatural procedure that kills the baby in the womb. An ectopic procedure, in contrast, attempts to save the life of both mother and unborn child. A number of \u00a0treatment options are available, but each seeks to separate the embryo from the fallopian tubes. \u00a0\nSince abortion has been the cheap and easy option for so long, improvements in women\u2019s health have not kept up with science. Medical technology is not able to reimplant the embryo in the uterus, saving the life of the baby. A miscarriage is tragically inevitable.\nUnlike abortion, the goal in an ectopic pregnancy is to save the life of the baby. Bold, state-level protections for life will likely lead to innovations in ectopic care in the near future. \u00a0\nDoctors successfully saved the life of a woman suffering from a ruptured\u00a0ectopic pregnancy in 1883. Similar procedures have continued in the United States since, even with pre-Roe protections for life on the books.\nDoctors are fully aware that an ectopic pregnancy is not an abortion, and state law has similarly recognized it. \u00a0\nTreating an ectopic pregnancy is just not the same thing as an abortion. Before Dobbs, medicals experts from Francis to the Mayo Clinic, and even pro-abortion activists such as Planned Parenthood, agreed on that point. After Francis\u2019 testimony, however, Planned Parenthood changed its website\u2019s definition of an ectopic pregnancy to muddle the truth.\n\nThat was a blatant attempt to hide the truth and lie to vulnerable women about lifesaving medical treatments. In states with pro-life laws, it unnecessarily places women in fear of seeking proper medical care for an ectopic pregnancy.\nCountless articles have written about how\u00a0fear of legal harm\u00a0could cause doctors to delay lifesaving medical care.\n\u201cBut in Republicans\u2019 post-Roe world, health care providers aren\u2019t sure when or even if they will able to treat ectopic patients without being sent to prison,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., asserted without evidence. \u201cSome have already been instructed to observe patients until they have unstable vital signs before acting\u2014basically, to sit on their hands until women are at dire risk, before they can do what they know is medically necessary.\u201d\nOthers repeat apocryphal stories of women in pro-life states being\u00a0denied\u00a0medical care for an ectopic pregnancy. This\u00a0fearmongering\u00a0has even come from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\u201cIf the MAGA Republicans get their way, pregnant women could lose their lives, because there will be no exception for the life of the mother if there\u2019s a dangerous complication in the pregnancy,\u201d Schumer claimed, also without evidence.\nSuch claims, from one of the highest-ranking Democrats, irresponsibly and needlessly puts\u00a0women in harm\u2019s way. \u00a0\nDespite the abortion lobby\u2019s rhetoric on ectopic pregnancies, no state calls ending such a pregnancy an abortion.\u00a0Nebraska,\u00a0Texas,\u00a0Oklahoma, and\u00a0Missouri\u00a0all have strong pro-life protections in place, and all allow doctors to treat ectopic pregnancies. \u00a0\nNebraska, for example, defines an abortion as the intent to terminate a preborn baby. It notes that to \u201cremove an ectopic pregnancy\u201d is legal and not considered abortion. \u00a0\nOther states, like Missouri, do not mention treatments for ectopic pregnancies explicitly. Instead, state law permits what might lead to fetal death in \u201ccases of medical emergency.\u201d\nAbortion activists argue that that relies too heavily on the subjective judgment of doctors. As a result, doctors might delay lifesaving care at the peril of the mother when assessing an ectopic pregnancy. That\u2019s scaremongering. Still, states like Missouri could put this pro-abortion talking point to rest by protecting treatment of ectopic pregnancy explicitly in the law. \u00a0\nEven in Texas, whose \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d was one of the first successful protections for life, the law clearly defines and separates an ectopic pregnancy from abortion.\u00a0Nonetheless,\u00a0Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas-based OB-GYN, claimed, \u201cMy colleagues are asking if they\u2019re still allowed to treat an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. They\u2019re worried they will have to delay lifesaving care.\u201d\nThe procedure is permitted in a medical emergency,\u00a0which Missouri state law defines as\u00a0necessary to save the patient\u2019s life or \u201cfor which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\u201d\u00a0\nThe same activists who claim pro-life laws are \u201cunclear\u201d on what to do with an ectopic pregnancy are silent in the face of clear evidence to the contrary.\nRather than helping women and protecting the life of preborn babies, pro-abortion activists push fear and falsehoods. Pro-life advocates need to push back with the truth about ectopic pregnancies. \u00a0\nThis piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on This Issue\n\nLife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  6 min read\n\n\nIVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nBiden\u2019s SOTU Abortion Lies\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY  3 min read\n\n\nTammy Duckworth\u2019s IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\n\nAbout Heritage\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nRenew\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nPress\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\n\n                \u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
