Advocates and activists continue to push for equitable wages, reproductive freedom, childcare, opportunity for education and employment, and full access to the vote. The ERA, introduced to address many of these issues, has now been ratified by 38 states and faces legal challenges ahead. Now, the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn new attention to gender inequalities, as women continue to shoulder the burden of childcare without public support. Join the American Constitution Society for a panel discussion of the movements for women's equality in celebration of the 19th Amendment's centennial.\nWelcome Remarks:\nRuss Feingold, ACS President\nSpeakers:\nMelissa Murray, Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law, New York University Law School,\u00a0Moderator\nThe Honorable Jennifer McClellan, Virginia State Senator\nReva Siegel, Nicholas deB.
