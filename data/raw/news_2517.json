PHOTO COURTESY OF LIFE ALLIANCE\t\t\n\nBy Aaron Curtis | acurtis@lowellsun.com | Lowell SunPUBLISHED: March 22, 2020 at 5:47 p.m. | UPDATED: March 23, 2020 at 9:45 a.m.BILLERICA \u2014 Deedee Dorrington describes herself as \u201cextremely pro-life.\u201d\nWhen it comes to the divisive topic of abortion, the Billerica resident said she also takes a pragmatic approach. Dorrington\u2019s research and consideration on the topic has led her to believe abortion will most likely always be an option for those considering one.\n\u201cI wish women would never feel a need to abort their children,\u201d Dorrington said. \u201cI wish that would never happen, but the bottom line is \u2014 and this is my opinion \u2014 we do need to accept abortion to an extent. I say that being vehemently pro-life.\u201d\nIn April 2018, Dorrington formed a group called Life Alliance with a goal to encourage legislators to modify state abortion laws. Abortion is legal in Massachusetts for any reason up to 24 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 a length of time Dorrington calls \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\nIn January 2019, Life Alliance decided to pursue a compromise. They submitted a petitioner\u2019s bill to legislators that would limit legal abortions on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy. After that time legal abortions would be provided to only those deemed medically necessary to save the life of the mother. The bill didn\u2019t succeed, but Life Alliance hopes that will change in the future.\nIn the meantime, Life Alliance continues on with its mission to take \u201clife affirming actions that help others, and help our community to be more compassionate,\u201d Dorrington said. \n\n\n\u201cBeing pro-life is not a political position,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding ways we can help those around us and asking ourselves, \u2018How can we make other people\u2019s lives better? How can we make life enjoyable and more meaningful?'\u201d\nMuriel Ostrowski, the volunteer director for the Heartbeat Pregnancy Care Center, shows off toys given to the Burlington-based nonprofit by Life Alliance. PHOTO COURTESY OF LIFE ALLIANCE\nDorrington recently took time to flip through the pages of a meticulously laid out scrapbook that\u2019s been nearly two years in the making. The 58-year-old mother of two goes over each colorful page full of photos, clippings and notes that capture the volunteer work carried out by Life Alliance. \n\n\nMade up of eight \u201cguiding members,\u201d Life Alliance goes beyond the politics and supports various nonprofits involved with the lives of women, children and families by serving as \u201cthe boots on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cWe find needs in our community and then seek out established organizations who already serve these needs,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we ask them what we can do to help, take that idea to our community, and then their generosity takes over.\u201d\nFlipping through the pages of her scrapbook, Dorrington provides a glimpse into the group\u2019s efforts. For example, a pair of fundraisers by Life Alliance resulted in about $18,600 raised for the Heartbeat Pregnancy Health Center in Burlington.\nThe nonprofit offers things like free pregnancy tests and prenatal and infant care education, the group\u2019s website states. The Heartbeat Pregnancy Health Center also provides maternity and baby clothes, cribs and car seats for its clients.\nLife Alliance also collected toys, clothing and shoes for the Dracut-based group home named Little Heroes Home. The organization provides \u201ca home-like environment where children can develop the skills to manage complex trauma or mental health symptoms in order to successfully transition to a permanent placement in the community,\u201d according to their website.\nMembers of Life Alliance, from left, Ann Marie Chicarelli, Kathy Parsons, Deedee Dorrington, Kathleen Scanlon, Mary Gordon-Judge, Susan Robertson, Blake Robertson and Bev Roach. Life Alliance, founded by Dorrington, is a group of community volunteers whose goal is to help nonprofits. PHOTO COURTESY OF LIFE ALLIANCE\nThe group\u2019s mission extends beyond fundraisers. Life Alliance sponsored an event last May that allowed Jasmine Grace, author of \u201cThe Diary of Jasmine Grace\u201d and a sex trafficking abolitionist, to share her story.\nDuring the event, Grace detailed her ability to overcome a tumultuous past that led to her time as a domestic sex trafficking victim. Attendees packed the VFW Post in Billerica to see and hear Grace speak.\nOther groups helped by Life Alliance include My Father\u2019s House, The Wish Project and Solutions for Living. The group also raised money to help fathers and their daughters attend the Shamrock Ball in Billerica.\nDorrington gets to the end of her scrapbook that contains a number of empty pages. Plans are already in the works to fill them, she points out.\nThe latest cause Life Alliance is focused on includes donating undergarments to area hospitals to provide to sexual assault victims. Dorrington explains sexual assault victims are forced to turn their undergarments over to police as evidence, leaving them without the personal items when they exit the hospital.\nAccording to Dorrington, Life Alliance is currently working out the logistics of the latest charity idea.\n\u201cThe way our community is, I know Billerica is going to come through 100%,\u201d she said.\nLife Alliance has experienced criticism from some members of the community, which Dorrington said stems from a misrepresentation of who they are.\n\u201cPeople hear the words \u2018pro-life\u2019 and automatically dismiss us as a group of close-minded individuals who only want to hurt women and take away their rights and it\u2019s quite the opposite,\u201d Dorrington said. \u201cWe have nothing but compassion for women who are facing an unplanned pregnancy, and women who have abortions, and who may need healing and understanding after the fact.\u201d\nTalking about her time with Life Alliance, group member Kathleen Scanlon said it brings joy and fulfillment to her life.\n\u201cI love being able to give some of my time to help fundraise and give support to women, children and families who need to know someone out there cares about their story, their struggles and who believes they matter,\u201d she said.\nLife Alliance member Andrew Robertson expressed similar feelings about his time with the group.\n\u201cLife is short,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to know that they are not alone and that they are loved.\u201d\nTo learn more about Life Alliance, visit the group\u2019s website at lifealliance.life or its Facebook page at facebook.com/lifealliancebillerica.\nFollow Aaron Curtis on Twitter @aselahcurtis\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window) \n\n \n\nMost PopularMost PopularArrest logArrest logMan killed in blaze at single-family home in CentralvilleMan killed in blaze at single-family home in CentralvilleTewksbury falls 4-2 to Boston Latin in Div. 2 boys hockey state title gameTewksbury falls 4-2 to Boston Latin in Div. 2 boys hockey state title gameCommunity comes together with Dawoodi Bohras in Billerica to break Ramadan fastCommunity comes together with Dawoodi Bohras in Billerica to break Ramadan fastCawley Stadium\u2019s $8 million faceliftCawley Stadium's $8 million faceliftArrest logArrest logSeeing orbs in photos?
