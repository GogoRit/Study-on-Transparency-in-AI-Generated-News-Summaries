Wade decision, and its recent 49th\u00a0anniversary, are both reminders of how that 1973 decision guaranteeing women the right to a safe, legal abortion continues to impact the country.The most recent\u00a0Gallup poll\u00a0on the issue reveals America is divided on whether to overturn Roe v. Wade: 58% say no, while 32% in favor of it. Thousands gathered recently in Washington, D.C. in the March For Life to support a reversal. \nOpinion bug\nOpinion\nAs a practicing Catholic, advanced practice nurse, mother and a female who believes in the sanctity of life as well as a woman\u2019s right to control her own reproduction, my stance on abortion has swung from one end to the other over the years.\u00a0I remain pro-life \u2014 but I am also in favor of Roe v. Wade.As a 12-year-old growing up in suburban Detroit, I wasn\u2019t old enough to understand the controversy surrounding the Roe v. Wade decision, or what abortion was about. I recall pamphlets that circulated at our parish, with graphic color pictures of aborted fetuses that left me horrified and perplexed.\u00a0In college, I witnessed Roe v. Wade touted as a solution to the problem of abortions being performed in secret under dangerous conditions. Physicians advocated for legalized abortion after witnessing women arriving in emergency rooms hemorrhaging from botched abortions.\u00a0In a 1975\u00a0\u201c60 Minutes\u201d\u00a0interview with Morley Safer, first lady Betty Ford praised the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to \u201cbring [abortion] out of the back woods and put it in the hospitals where it belongs.\u201d\u00a0But statistics since then seem to validate concerns that abortion would be used as a form of birth control, fueling the backlash from anti-abortion groups.\u00a0Guttmacher Institute\u00a0statistics show a nearly 20% decrease in the number of abortions in this country between 2011 to 2017, and the number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 also fell by 20%. Even so, that leaves hundreds of thousands of abortions performed every year. Additionally, state\u00a0laws allowing late-term abortions\u00a0past the age of viability have further fueled attacks on Roe v Wade.Fewer unplanned pregnanciesAs an undergraduate nursing student in the 1980s,\u00a0my professors convinced me that abortion was a necessary option to protect the well-being of adolescent girls. Taking away a woman\u2019s right to a safe, legal abortion was unconscionable.As a practicing Catholic and mother, I understand the Catholic Church has condemned abortion since the 4th century. Religious convictions aside, however, Roe v. Wade needs to stand. But the number of unplanned, unwanted pregnancies needs to fall sharply as wellAs history has shown us, abortions will be performed whether they are legal and safe, or not. The\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0estimates that out of 55.7 million abortions performed worldwide each year between 2011 and 2014, 25 million,\u00a0or 45%, were unsafe. Nearly 23,000\u00a0women die each year from complications of unsafe abortion,\u00a0research shows. As many as seven million women a year survive, but with long-term damage or disease.\nOpinion Newsletter\n\n\n\n\nAs a nurse, I\u2019m charged to help those in need, alleviate suffering, and provide care to those in crisis. An unwanted pregnancy is a tragedy that may leave a woman or girl in a desperate situation.Women must have reproductive\u00a0autonomy and privacy.\u00a0Attacks on women\u2019s reproductive autonomy are a form of misogyny. Often attacks on abortion come from conservative political and religious factions that are against the advancement of women.I would like to see abortion remain an option that is rarely used. Single-parent pregnancies have been de-stigmatized, so when possible, many can encourage women to carry their pregnancies to term and choose adoption.It is necessary and ideal to strengthen social support systems for women and families too. Perhaps it is possible to limit abortion by individual actions rather than government interference.\u00a0The best possible outcomes come from these individual choices.Cynthia Farina is an assistant professor in the Rush University Nurse Anesthesia Doctor of Nursing Practice Program.
