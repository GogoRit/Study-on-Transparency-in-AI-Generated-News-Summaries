In Northern Ireland, women face a lifetime in prison for terminating a pregnancy \u2013 a procedure freely available on the NHS to women in the rest of the UK.\nThe laws putting women behind bars were drawn up in the Nineteenth Century \u2013 and that\u2019s where they belong. New research out today confirms that the law is out of step with public attitudes.\nLifetime in prison for an abortion \u2013 in the UK\n\nEven when a woman is pregnant as a result of rape, incest, or when the foetus has no medical chance of surviving, she faces life imprisonment in Northern Ireland, thanks to a law drawn up in 1861 and not updated since. Medical professionals who assist women with abortions also face life in prison.\nLast year, in a historic ruling, Northern Ireland\u2019s High Court found that the abortion ban is denying women their human rights. But the law remains unchanged, and even this year, after the ruling, women have been put on trial for having or assisting with abortions. Meanwhile, the government is appealing the findings of the High Court that women\u2019s human rights are breached through the abortion ban.\nThe laws have created a system where women who can afford to travel to the mainland UK \u2013 often on their own \u2013 for an abortion, facing shame, stigma and discrimination in their families, workplaces and communities, while women unable to travel risk the danger of taking abortion pills without medical support in Northern Ireland \u2013 and a lifetime in prison, if they\u2019re found out.\nThe ban in brief\n\n\u00a0\nPoll: Public doesn\u2019t think abortion should be a crime\n\u201cThese poll findings demonstrate an overwhelming demand for change to Northern Ireland\u2019s draconian abortion laws. This is not a small margin of support for women\u2019s access to abortion, it\u2019s a definitive landslide.\u201d\nAdrienne Peltz, Amnesty Northern Ireland Campaigner\n\nThe research shows that the majority of people in Northern Ireland don\u2019t think that abortion should be a crime at all (58%), while there is even more widespread support to decriminalise abortion for women who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or the foetus has no chance of survival, with 69.5% of people polled saying they\u2019d like to see women stop being jailed in these circumstances.\nThe poll, conducted by independent research company Millward Brown Ulster, collected the views of 1,000 people across Northern Ireland through face-to-face interviews with people living in a mix of urban and rural areas, representing a range of religious and political views.\n\n72% want abortion to be decriminalised in cases of rape or incest (sex crimes)\n69% are for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality \u2013 where medical professionals have deemed there no chance of the foetus surviving\n58% of people asked think women who have abortions shouldn\u2019t be punished as criminals\n59% of people believe that medical staff shouldn\u2019t be imprisoned for assisting women with abortion\n\nA minority of people support the existing ban.\n\nOnly 16% of people believe the law should not change, and that women should face prison for having an abortion when they when they are pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or the foetus has no chance of survival\nOnly 22% believe women should face criminal punishment for terminating any kind of pregnancy.\n\n\nMarked increase in support for abortion access\nThe poll signals that public attitudes have strengthened recently in favour of decriminalising abortion. Two years ago, polling company Millward Brown put the same questions to a similar sample of people, with the results showing that a majority favoured decriminalisation. Compare the 2014 research with the 2016 poll, and there are marked differences in favour of changing the law.\nIn 2014, 69% of people in Northern Ireland supported access to abortion in cases of rape or incest, a figure which now sits at 72%. Meanwhile, 60% of respondents supported access to abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality \u2013 this has grown to 67%.\nNorthern Ireland must stop denying women their human rights\nWe\u2019re calling for an outright end to the ban on abortion in Northern Ireland. We support the High Court ruling that the ban is breaching the rights of women in the cases of fatal foetal abnormality and where the pregnancy is a result of sex crimes. Now the ruling needs to bring a change in the law.\nWe\u2019re calling on Northern Ireland\u2019s leaders to bring the law into the 21st Century, and stop denying women their rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          18 May 2020, 05:28pm\n        \n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related\n\n\nMore about abortion in Ireland and Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While you\u2019re here\u2026\nLike you, we are horrified by the violence and the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
