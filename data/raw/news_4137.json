The law requires anyone under 18 to get consent from a parent or legal guardian before having an abortion.\nMost young people under 18 voluntarily involve a parent or another trusted adult in their abortion decision, even if the law doesn\u2019t require it. But for those who don\u2019t \u2013 often because they fear abuse, deterioration of family relationships, being kicked out of the home, or being forced to continue a pregnancy \u2013 laws like Florida\u2019s pose a barrier to their care.\nFlorida reproductive justice advocates opposed the law, arguing that lawmakers should trust young people to make decisions that are best for their health and lives. I joined them in the state capital, Tallahassee, to testify at a Senate hearing about how forced parental consent would undermine young people\u2019s human rights.\nBut it\u2019s important for young people in Florida who need abortion care to know they still have options, even without involving a parent.\nFlorida\u2019s law allows young people to choose a process called judicial bypass and show a judge they are mature enough to make an abortion decision without their parents, or that involving their parents is not in their best interest. These young people will have a court-appointed attorney, and won\u2019t have to pay any legal fees.\nFloridians for Reproductive Freedom has information about the process on their website. Jane\u2019s Due Process has a hotline that anyone in the country can call for more information (1-866-999-5263). The national organization If/When/How has a wiki page with information about judicial bypass in every state. Power U is hosting a tweetstorm today to ensure young people know what this law means for them. Follow at #myvoicemychoice.\nFor those who want to help young people navigate this process, Florida reproductive justice advocate Stephanie Loraine published guidance on being a compassionate and effective helper.\u00a0\nFlorida\u2019s law is a sobering reminder that attempts to restrict access to abortion care won\u2019t end with this week\u2019s Supreme Court decision. It\u2019s also a moment in which the work of reproductive justice groups is especially valuable, as they help to ensure that young people in Florida can still access abortion and get the care they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$50\n\n\n\n\n\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\n$250\n\n\n\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\n$1000\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion / Country\n\nUnited States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\nWomen's Rights Reproductive Rights and Abortion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 12, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nProtecting Women\u2019s Reproductive Health During the Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nGovernments Call for Protection of Sexual and Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reports\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nAccess Denied\n\n\nHow Florida Judges Obstruct Young People\u2019s Ability to Obtain Abortion Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2022\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cWe Need Access\u201d\n\n\nEnding Preventable Deaths from Cervical Cancer in Rural Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    More Reading\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 12, 2020\n\n          Commentary\n        \n\n\nProtecting Women\u2019s Reproductive Health During the Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n          Dispatches\n        \n\n\nGovernments Call for Protection of Sexual and Reproductive Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Most Viewed\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nIndia: Authorities Revoke Visa Privileges of Diaspora Critics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\nA Dirty Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          News Release\n        \n\n\nPhilippines: LGBT Students Face Bullying, Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\n          Q & A\n        \n\n\nQ&A: Access to Abortion is a Human Right \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n          Report\n        \n\n\n\u201cJust Let Us Be\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this via Facebook\n\n\n\nShare this via Twitter\n\n\n\nShare this via WhatsApp\n\n\n\nShare this via Email\n\n\n\nOther ways to share\n\n\n\nShare this via LinkedIn\n\n\n\nShare this via Reddit\n\n\n\nShare this via Telegram\n\n\n\nShare this via Printer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProtecting Rights, Saving Lives\nHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in close to 100 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
