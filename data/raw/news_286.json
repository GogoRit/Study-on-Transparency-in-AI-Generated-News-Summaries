Physicians convicted of performing an abortion while aware that the diagnosis is affecting the decision could be charged with a fourth-degree felony, stripped of their medical license, and held liable for legal damages. The mothers would not be held liable.\nFederal Judge Timothy Black first blocked the law from taking effect in March 2018. It was set to go into effect on the 23rd of that month.\nSupporters of the law have questioned Black\u2019s impartiality. He had served as president of Cincinnati\u2019s Planned Parenthood in 1988 and as its director from 1986-1989. He recused himself from a case involving Planned Parenthood in 2014.\nArkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah all in 2019 enacted measures restricting abortions based on Down syndrome diagnoses. Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas have also passed measures restricting abortions based on the sex or race of the child.\nWhile Missouri\u2019s bans remain in effect, the bans in Arkansas and Kentucky are blocked in the courts, according to the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, attorneys advocating for the Ohio law say that the law is advancing a compelling interest, namely protecting the Down syndrome population from discrimination and elimination.\nThe state\u2019s attorneys in the case,\u00a0Preterm-Cleveland, et al. v. Amy Acton, et al., also argue that because of how the law is structured, it only impedes doctors, not pregnant women, and thus is constitutional.\nIn a friend-of-the-court brief filed in January with the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Department of Justice said that Ohio\u2019s law is constitutional, protects vulnerable individuals and mothers from coercive abortions, and upholds the integrity of the medical profession.\n\u201cThe federal government has an interest in the equal dignity of those who live with disabilities,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division stated.\n\u201cNothing in the Constitution requires Ohio to authorize abortion providers to participate in abortions the providers know are based on Down syndrome.\u201d\nIn contrast, a number of parents of children with Down syndrome have filed an amicus brief in opposition to the abortion ban, writing that the law \u201cpoliticizes a specific diagnosis\u2015Down syndrome\u2015and seeks to commandeer the resources, support, and interests of a community in order to advance an anti-abortion agenda,\u201d and claiming that \u201cthe freedom to choose whether to create a family that might include a child with Down syndrome is critically important.\u201d\n\n\n\nArticle Tags\nAbortion, Down syndrome, Legislation, Ohio\n \n\n\n\n\nCatholic News Agency\n\n\n\nCatholic News Agency\n \n\nCatholic News Agency was founded in 2004, in response to Pope St. John Paul II\u2019s call for a \u201cNew Evangelization.\" It is an apostolate of EWTN News.\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst religious order created to provide Montessori-style education\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nKate Qui\u00f1ones \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   4  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBehind the feud between Texas archdiocese and a defiant ministry group\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPeter Pinedo \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   3  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaint of the day: Joseph\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nAngelus Staff \u2022 Mar 19, 2024 \u2022   < 1  Min Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee All\n\nRELATED ARTICLESFederal court upholds Ohio's Down syndrome abortion ban  by Catholic News Agency  April 13, 2021 Tennessee Down syndrome abortion ban back in effect while legal challenges continue  by Jonah McKeown  February 3, 2022 Texas Supreme Court considers request for clarity on exemptions to abortion ban  by Kate Scanlon  November 29, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your day with Always Forward!\nA daily email newsletter to help you better understand the Church and the world.\n\nEnter your email address here\n\n*\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy.\n\n Sign Up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nCookie Policy\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbout\nSubscribe\nAlways Forward Newsletter\nContact\nDonate\nArchdiocese of Los Angeles\nAdvertise\nRenew\nArchbishop Jos\u00e9 H.
