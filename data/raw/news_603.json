(WIS) - South Carolina lawmakers in the Senate have voted to pass the Fetal Heartbeat Bill after several days of debate.The bill now goes to the House, where it\u2019s likely to pass.Republicans hold majorities in both chambers, and they\u2019ve made it a priority to pass this legislation at the beginning of the current session.Senators voted 30 to 13 for the bill\u2019s passage on Thursday, largely along party lines.One Democrat voted with Republicans in favor of the bill: Kent Williams, of Marion. Alternately, one Republican voted against the bill: Sandy Senn, of Charleston.The bill would ban abortions in the state once a heartbeat is detected, which usually occurs around six to eight weeks into a woman\u2019s pregnancy.Senators did vote to add four exceptions to the ban: in the case of rape, incest, a fetal anomaly, or if the mother\u2019s life is threatened by her pregnancy.Gov. Henry McMaster has been vocal in his support of the bill, urging lawmakers to pass it.Bill banning abortions after 6 to 8 weeks faces one more big hurdle in the SC SenateMcMaster touts support for Fetal Heartbeat Bill before Senate debate enters 2nd daySC Senate adds an exception for rape and incest to Fetal Heartbeat BillSimilar laws passed in other states have been tied up in court battles.However, proponents of South Carolina\u2019s Fetal Heartbeat Bill say the opinion of the courts are changing, and they believe the new conservative majority in the Supreme Court will help their case.Copyright 2021 WIS.
