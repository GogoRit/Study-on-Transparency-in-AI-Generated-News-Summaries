(Earl Neikirk for The Washington Post)Listen13 minShareAdd to your saved storiesSaveBecky Hubbard, 46, has decided to get sterilized so that she can go back on the only medication that has relieved her disabling pain from rheumatoid arthritis for the last eight years.Soon after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the Tennessee woman said she got an ultimatum from her rheumatologist. If she wanted to stay on the treatment of choice for her condition, a drug called methotrexate, she was told she had to go on birth control despite her age and history of infertility.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight\u201cIt is frustrating as hell,\u201d said Hubbard, a former nurse who lives in Johnson City, Tenn., now waiting to see her gynecologist.The sudden imposition of antiabortion laws after Roe\u2019s reversal has left patients, doctors and pharmacists wading through a minefield of treatment issues and legal and ethical dilemmas related to women\u2019s health care \u2014 even in situations like Hubbard\u2019s that have nothing to do with pregnancy.AdvertisementMedicines that treat conditions from cancer to autoimmune diseases to ulcers can also end a pregnancy or cause birth defects. As a result, doctors and pharmacists in more than a dozen states with strict abortion restrictions must suddenly navigate whether and when to order such drugs because they could be held criminally liable and lose their licenses for prescribing some of them to pregnant women.A look at some medications under increased scrutiny amid abortion bansEven if they can show their patients suffer from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, some doctors worry they could be prosecuted for prescribing such drugs to a patient with an unintended pregnancy. Such patients are also at greater risk because they can no longer seek abortions in their home states should they accidentally become pregnant while taking such drugs \u2014 no matter how grievous the injuries to the developing fetus.\u201cMethotrexate is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Traci Poole, a practicing pharmacist and faculty member at Belmont University College of Pharmacy in Nashville. \u201cIf you are of childbearing age, are you going to be denied medications that could potentially interfere with a pregnancy?\u201dAdvertisementThere are no reliable estimates of how many women like Hubbard may have had their treatment regimens affected under the spate of new abortion bans. But some patient advocates say they have received dozens of reports from people encountering obstacles in the weeks since Roe\u2019s reversal.\u201cWe were surprised at the sheer number of complaints from people with arthritis and autoimmune conditions who were having problems filling prescriptions for methotrexate after the Dobbs decision,\u201d said Steven Newmark, director of policy and chief legal officer for the Global Healthy Living Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of people with chronic diseases.The group is now attempting to check those accounts, submitted through CreakyJoints, its digital forum for people with arthritis and their caregivers. Newmark said the group has also reached out to elected officials to try to clarify state policies \u2014 so far with no success. He said he would be surprised if even those with strong antiabortion views would not want to protect people living in pain.Advertisement\u201cTrigger laws should not be impacting chronically ill patients in need of medication,\u201d he said.Tell The Post: How has the end of Roe v. Wade affected your experience with reproductive health care?Doctors and pharmacists acknowledge being blindsided by the speed of the changes to state laws and say they are making changes to their practices to protect against liability. Major pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens, for instance, are instructing employees to make extra checks to validate that prescriptions will not be used to terminate pregnancies and delay filling them until their intended use is confirmed.Civil rights and women\u2019s advocates denounce many of these changes, questioning whether they may violate federal protections against discrimination on the basis of sex or disability. The issues are particularly disturbing, they say, since women are far more likely than men to have autoimmune diseases, and to be treated for conditions ranging from acne to anxiety and depression.Advertisement\u201cWe are seeing the spillover effects of Dobbs,\u201d said Usha Ranji, associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy. \u201cThe impact is going to fall hard on women.\u201dAntiabortion activists, for their part, reject that view. They say they\u2019re troubled by accounts like Hubbard\u2019s because they never intended to restrict drugs like methotrexate to women with chronic health conditions.Katie Glenn, state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an antiabortion advocacy group, said doctors and pharmacists should not have any concerns about prescribing those drugs to their patients, as long as they are not doing so to terminate a pregnancy.\u201cIntent is the key here,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a rheumatologist, you\u2019re not doing abortions. If you\u2019ve never prescribed methotrexate for abortion, you\u2019re free to continue prescribing it as you were.\u201d\u2018The gold standard\u2019For Hubbard, Roe\u2019s reversal has been life-changing. Before Tennessee\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d ban blocked most abortions in the state, she said her doctors had no problem treating her with methotrexate even though she wasn\u2019t taking birth control.AdvertisementShe and her husband have been unable to conceive for nearly two decades so the chance of her becoming pregnant in her late 40s seemed minuscule. She had taken birth control pills years ago, which she believes affected her health, so she is loath to try them again. She has similar worries about an IUD.With Roe v. Wade overturned, the legality of abortion has been left to the states. Some worry that access to certain types of contraception could be next. (Video: Julie Yoon, Hadley Green, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)But most of all, she hates the idea of going off methotrexate, an extraordinarily effective anti-inflammatory taken by nearly 60 percent of all rheumatoid arthritis patients, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.\u201cIt is the gold standard for almost every rheumatological or autoimmune disease that affects the connective tissue, especially the joints,\u201d said Fehmida Zahabi, a rheumatologist in the north Dallas area and president of the State of Texas Association of Rheumatologists.The drug has gained notoriety for other uses as well. Methotrexate is specifically named in several abortion bans because at a higher dose, it has been used to induce abortions and also to end ectopic pregnancies when an embryo implants outside the uterus \u2014 a dire situation in which the fertilized egg cannot survive and must be removed to avoid life-threatening complications for the mother.AdvertisementIt can also lead to birth defects, and the potential of accidental pregnancies in places where abortion is banned has led some rheumatologists to reconsider prescribing the drug to women of childbearing age.Share this articleShareWhat Hubbard knows is that a treatment regimen featuring methotrexate enabled her to resume her life after her arthritis had become so crippling she had to stop working as a nurse. Although she began taking the medication in 2014, it has taken years of trial and error to find the right combination and dosages of drugs to keep the disease from progressing. While she still can\u2019t work full time, she said she sells crafts that she makes at home and is able to spend more time with her adopted 14-year-old son.She said she fears that without methotrexate, her pain would take over her life again. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get the medicine that gets you out of the flares, you just have to live with the pain,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201dAdvertisementNewmark, the patient advocate, noted that the difference between taking medication and not for those with severe rheumatoid arthritis \u201cis the difference between living normally and writhing in pain in bed.\u201d Switching to another treatment is not simple, either, he added, because patients often spend years experimenting to find the right combination of drugs to keep their diseases in check.Hubbard\u2019s doctor declined to comment for this story, saying he could not discuss an individual patient\u2019s treatment.Most medical groups say they are sympathetic to the plight of such patients and looking to see what steps they might take to protect them.\u201cPhysicians have been placed in an impossible situation \u2014 trying to meet their ethical duties to place patient health and well-being first, while attempting to comply with vague, restrictive, complex, and conflicting state laws that interfere in the practice of medicine and jeopardize the health of patients,\u201d Jack Resneck Jr., president of the American Medical Association, told federal lawmakers on July 19.AdvertisementThe American College of Rheumatology assembled a task force last month to try to assess the scope of the problem, said Kenneth Saag, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThere is concern \u2026 that one of the unintended consequences is that patients are going to have reduced access to this medicine and other medicines,\u201d he said.Physicians are also worried about their potential liability from antiabortion laws that took effect virtually overnight in some states following the high court\u2019s decision, said Saag, director of the division of clinical rheumatology the University of Alabama at Birmingham.They\u2019re also concerned about the ramifications of accidental pregnancies. While doctors prescribing drugs such as methotrexate routinely talk to their patients about the importance of birth control, he said, unintended pregnancies occur, posing distressing questions for doctors and patients.\u201cSome women have elected historically to consider pregnancy termination\u201d in such situations, he said. \u201cIn some places, that may no longer be an option.\u201dAnxious patientsAs doctors balance their liability against their patients\u2019 needs and medical standards of care, women who depend on such drugs say they feel frightened and anxious about whether they will be able to obtain their next refill.Claire Eby, who lives near Austin, has taken methotrexate since she was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis at age 4. When she was 18, her doctors tried to wean her off the drug, believing she was going into remission.\u201cThings went down south really fast,\u201d said Eby, now 26. She developed inflammation in her eyes, which led to cataracts. The medicine that stopped her eyes from deteriorating further was methotrexate.\u201cYour health can deteriorate rapidly and also permanently,\u201d if you stop taking methotrexate, Eby said. \u201cMy vision damage was permanent.\u201dEby said she takes birth control, but her doctors also recently added a pregnancy test to the routine lab work she has to undergo every three months to stay on the medication \u2014 a change that coincided with Texas\u2019s increasingly strict abortion restrictions.\u201cThey hadn\u2019t done that before,\u201d Eby said.Doctors usually recommend against stopping methotrexate without being weaned off slowly, and some patients worry that getting cut off from the drug when they go to get a refill could be dangerous.\u201cIt\u2019s not safe to just cold-turkey stop,\u201d said lupus patient Becky Schwartz, 27, who lives in Tysons, Va.She said the firm that owns her rheumatologist\u2019s practice put a temporary pause on methotrexate prescriptions in July as it evaluates the laws that took effect after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, although Virginia has not imposed new abortion restrictions.Schwartz said she is grateful that she had just refilled her prescription before the new policy took effect, and she and her doctor came up with an emergency plan to wean her off the drug safely.But the date her prescription runs out looms big. \u201cI will have no meds left come September,\u201d she said.Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, pharmacists, who have liability for prescriptions they dispense, also have been scrambling to figure out how to respond.At least one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chains has told their pharmacists in states with abortion bans to ask for diagnosis codes before dispensing drugs like methotrexate and misoprostol, which is used to complete miscarriages as well as for abortions. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting women\u2019s health care,\u201d said Mike DeAngelis, CVS\u2019s executive director for corporate communications. But he added, \u201cThese laws, some of which include criminal penalties, have forced us to require pharmacists in these states to validate that the intended indication is not to terminate a pregnancy.\u201dA spokesman for Walgreens said that national pharmacy chain is also taking trigger laws into consideration when filling prescriptions for drugs that may be used to terminate a pregnancy. \u201cIn these states, our pharmacists work closely with prescribers as needed, to fill lawful, clinically appropriate prescriptions,\u201d Fraser Engerman, a company spokesman, said in an email.Such policy changes may be subject to challenge under federal civil rights law, however, because they potentially target people on the basis of sex and disability, argued Matthew Cortland, a senior fellow at Data for Progress, a think tank dedicated to advancing liberal causes, who shared a CVS memo on Twitter.Some doctors also object to pharmacies requiring diagnosis codes for drugs like methotrexate, saying that a forgotten code may lead to delays filling prescriptions for patients with debilitating pain.\u201cIt becomes a huge problem if we see [a] patient on Thursday or Friday and we don\u2019t get the pharmacy to call back\u201d immediately, said Zahabi, the Dallas-based rheumatologist. \u201cThe patient can\u2019t get treatment for three or four days, which can be agonizing.\u201dBut Poole dismissed such concerns, saying pharmacists have advocated for years for the use of such codes in the interest of patient safety; many medical offices already provide them on electronic prescriptions.Elisa Greene, associate professor of pharmacy practice at Belmont University College of Pharmacy, noted that prescribing and filling prescriptions for drugs that can cause birth defects is not a new issue. She contrasted the lack of guidance to doctors and pharmacists handling prescriptions like methotrexate with the tight regimen required by the FDA for those prescribing or dispensing Accutane \u2014 an acne treatment that can cause birth defects.Doctors and pharmacists, along with their patients regardless of age or gender, are required to enroll in an education program about the drug\u2019s potential dangers, she said. And female patients of childbearing age must have negative pregnancy test results before a prescription is filled.\u201cThat requirement \u2026 is not in place for methotrexate,\u201d Greene wrote in a text message.Living in painFor patients like Hubbard, the concerns are more immediate. She has gone without methotrexate injections for several weeks now, while waiting to see a gynecologist about having a tubal ligation that will prevent her from ever getting pregnant.A week ago, she fell down during her son\u2019s birthday celebration because of the pain in her joints. \u201cThings have definitely gotten worse,\u201d she said. \u201cMy joints aren\u2019t doing as well.\u201dHubbard said she wishes she had the foresight to anticipate that Tennessee\u2019s fetal heartbeat law, which took effect the day after Roe\u2019s reversal, would have such a big effect on her own life.\u201cI knew there would be other things [than abortion] affected,\u201d she said. \u201cNever in my life did I think it would be my rheumatoid arthritis medicine.\u201dShareThe U.S. fight over abortionHAND CURATEDStates where abortion is legal, banned or under threatFebruary 28, 2024States where abortion is legal, banned or under threatFebruary 28, 2024In history-making visit, Harris tours Minnesota abortion clinicMarch 14, 2024In history-making visit, Harris tours Minnesota abortion clinicMarch 14, 2024Walgreens, CVS to begin selling abortion pill mifepristone in some statesMarch 1, 2024Walgreens, CVS to begin selling abortion pill mifepristone in some statesMarch 1, 2024View 3 more storiesSign upTOP STORIESPoliticsReporting and analysis from the Hill and the White HouseTrump may enlist Paul Manafort, who was criticized for Russia ties Biden and other Democrats forced to adapt to pro-Palestinian protests Analysis|\u2018Bloodbath\u2019 aside, Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric is unambiguousbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n"
