Kevin Stitt notwithstanding. In an eight-page opinion, the panel said it was letting stand a temporary restraining order issued April 6 by U.S. District Judge Charles Goodwin in Oklahoma City because it caused the state no irreparable harm, since Goodwin\u2019s order expires April 20.The ban was part of an executive order Stitt issued March 27 that banned all elective surgeries during the coronavirus outbreak. On April 3, Stitt extended the April 7 scheduled expiration of the ban until April 30.There was no immediate comment from Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter\u2019s office.Governors across the country have issued executive orders halting nonessential medical surgeries to free up hospitals, and Republicans have said abortions should be included under those mandates. Those bans, including Oklahoma\u2019s, were challenged in court by Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights and local lawyers in each state.The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to hear an appeal by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost seeking to reverse a judge\u2019s temporary restraining order allowing abortion facilities in the state to continue performing surgical abortions.A federal judge temporarily blocked a ban in Texas last week but the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals quickly put that ruling on hold, pending a review of the case. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel of Austin, Texas, followed up with an order allowing abortions in Texas by medication or in cases where a delay in the procedure would push a pregnancy beyond the state\u2019s 22-week legal cutoff. However, the 5th Circuit Court upheld the ban on abortions by medication.In a statement, Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said \u201cIt\u2019s time for Oklahoma and other states to stop exploiting the pandemic to shutdown clinics. Oklahoma\u2019s true motive has never been more apparent. This has nothing to do with the current pandemic \u2014 it\u2019s purely politics.\u201dMost Read 19-year-old Duncan man killed in single vehicle Texas crash One in critical condition after Tillman County rollover crashMan taken to hospital after Stephens Co. motorcycle wreck Republican State Senators respond to Pro Tempore\u2019s remarks calling their actions \u2018terroristic\u2019 Altus TikTok creator discusses trip to U.S. Capitol to defend app amidst potential banLatest NewsMan taken to hospital after Stephens Co. motorcycle wreck  Warm temperatures will return this afternoon | 3/19 AM City of Frederick prepares for scheduled outage to repair substation Another nice day ahead; storms Wednesday into Thursday | 3/18 PM Altus TikTok creator discusses trip to U.S. Capitol to defend app amidst potential banHomeNewsWeatherSportsAbout UsWatch LiveKSWO1401 SE 60th StreetLawton, OK 73501(580) 355-7000Public Inspection FilePublic File: KMIZE@KSWO.COM (580) 355-7000Terms of ServicePrivacy PolicyEEO ReportFCC ApplicationsAdvertisingDigital MarketingClosed Captioning/Audio DescriptionAt Gray, our journalists report, write, edit and produce the news content that informs the communities we serve.
