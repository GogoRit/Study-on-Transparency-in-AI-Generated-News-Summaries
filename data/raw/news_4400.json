If denied their rights, and without the social, cultural or economic power to claim them, whole populations of rights-holders can be excluded from even the most essential information, support, and services (e.g., family planning, safe abortion, comprehensive sexuality education).\u00a0\n\n\nThe Power of\u00a0Politics\u00a0\n\n\nThe global can affect the local. Even at the most macro-levels,\u00a0dominant politics and ideologies\u00a0can profoundly influence\u00a0an individual\u2019s realization of dignity\u00a0in the most intimate realms of their sexuality and their sexual and reproductive health well-being. Ruling ideologies and politics can promote target-driven approaches to reproduction as part of a country\u2019s development goals, encouraging or discouraging reproduction among certain groups (e.g., reproductive autonomy of women with disabilities, by passing laws mandating that they are sterilized)\u00a0and privileging certain notions of sexuality to the detriment of others (e.g., adolescent sexuality is an area where social norms about what is appropriate sexual behavior of young people have significant influence, limiting government will to implement evidence-based programs).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDominant\u00a0religious\u00a0and\u00a0cultural ideologies\u00a0disrespectful of human rights\u00a0can bleed\u00a0across borders\u00a0into\u00a0public\u00a0policy and\u00a0practice, distorting\u00a0the\u00a0rules\u00a0and standards\u00a0of\u00a0health systems,\u00a0skewing the distribution of resources,\u00a0and\u00a0influencing even how health care providers\u00a0treat people in their care.\u00a0For example,\u00a0services focus on\u00a0sexual\u00a0diseases\u00a0prevention\u00a0but not\u00a0on\u00a0sexual pleasure; on\u00a0maternal health\u00a0but\u00a0not on\u00a0access to safe\u00a0abortion;\u00a0on minimum\u00a0menstrual hygiene\u00a0for girls but not\u00a0on\u00a0broader\u00a0adolescent sexuality.\u00a0The results are distortions of the continuum of care whereby\u00a0crucial rights\u00a0go missing in action,\u00a0left at best\u00a0for\u00a0clandestine\u00a0response\u00a0only.\nWe urgently need far stronger action against the ways in which power, politics, and patriarchy influence sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nNational politics and ideologies also play out in regional and global dialogue and negotiation. Countries, notably those under populist, nativist leadership, seek to influence the international agenda for their national political interest rather than in accordance with their country\u2019s commitments under human rights law, as evident from recently concluded negotiations on\u00a0political declaration on Universal Health Coverage.\u00a0The result is policy incoherence and disconnects with impacts far beyond national borders. Yet, the normative standards of human rights and their associated obligations provide the impartial bedrock that inclusive and just policy and law need. Rights frameworks help expose, assess, and challenge systematically the inequalities, ideologies, and impunity that distort dignity in the interplay between sex, sexuality, identity, reproduction, and health.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Power\u00a0of\u00a0Patriarchy\u00a0\n\n\nThe persistence, overreach, and interplay between anti-science and anti-human rights influencers, specifically on public policy on sexuality and health, require further exposition. Its\u00a0evidence is seen in: toxic masculinities, homophobia, the perverse dynamic between sexism and racism, and in the opprobrium that adults direct against adolescent sexuality. The long shadow this patriarchy casts is evident, for example, in the ways family planning resource allocations have long skewed away from choice, among modern-methods, towards long-acting contraception and\u00a0even sterilization\u00a0for certain groups of women\u00a0such as\u00a0poor women, women with disabilities, and ethnic minorities. It\u2019s present when child marriage is tolerated on grounds of custom and faith rather than denounced for the child abuse that it is. It\u2019s there when a\u00a0victim of sexual violence\u00a0is required to marry the perpetrator; when governments leave rape in marriage unchallenged, or limit if not deny outright the sexual and reproductive autonomy of women with disabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPatriarchal assumptions and aspirations are behind actions that strip away individual and professional autonomy within the sexuality and health spaces. Certain governments, for example, have taken to invoking anew\u00a0undue restrictions\u00a0on access to the full range of information, goods, and services needed for enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health, a pattern clearly evident in the context of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic. Imperiling provision of quality care\u00a0clinically, interfering\u00a0improperly with professional practice, and arbitrary repurposing of funding away from sexual and reproductive health is in direct contravention of norms and standards for both health and human rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe excuse may be the religious or cultural beliefs of the powerful, but the consequences are far from ethereal: services deteriorate; access narrows; health professionals\u2019 attitudes, inclusiveness and responsiveness decline; and, as stigma mounts, otherwise preventable morbidities and mortality escalate. Far beyond the clinic cubicle, non-dominant gender identities emerge as acceptable targets for sexual and sexuality-related violence while a web of patriarchal structures and standards sees gender \u201cnorms\u201d stratify us into hierarchies of privilege and disadvantage, with only some of us deemed \u201cworthy\u201d of rights.\u00a0\n\n\nToday\u2019s geopolitics are pernicious against human dignity in the intimate realm. Their toxic influence threatens to derail carefully articulated global human rights standards, distort scientific guidance on essential health care, and weaken domestic implementation. We urgently need far stronger action against the ways in which power, politics, and patriarchy influence sexual and reproductive health and rights. We must expose how their dynamics delay, derail, and deny human rights, and denounce complicity by national and multilateral institutions and the actors within them.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nDignity in\u00a0intimacy\u00a0and\u00a0identity\u00a0must be upheld\u00a0specifically in health care.\u00a0Universal human rights standards\u00a0provide\u00a0a\u00a0touch stone,\u00a0but\u00a0their\u00a0mere\u00a0articulation\u00a0is far\u00a0from\u00a0sufficient.\u00a0Stronger,\u00a0active,\u00a0and organized\u00a0resistance\u00a0to\u00a0state sponsored regression is fundamental, particularly from the health professional classes.\u00a0But\u00a0in turn\u00a0this\u00a0requires\u00a0a\u00a0far\u00a0deeper, more\u00a0intersectional analysis\u00a0and action\u00a0on\u00a0power and powerlessness in\u00a0global and local\u00a0health,\u00a0specifically with respect to\u00a0gender,\u00a0race\u00a0and\u00a0equality across all identities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis piece is part of a series published in partnership with Occidental College\u2019s\u00a0Young Initiative on the Global Political Economy,\u00a0division of Social Sciences at Arizona State University, and\u00a0USC\u2019s\u00a0Institute on Inequalities in Global Health.
