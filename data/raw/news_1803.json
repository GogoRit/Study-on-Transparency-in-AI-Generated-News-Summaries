During an appearance on CNN last month, the GOP presidential hopeful was asked whether governments that restricted abortion had a financial responsibility to support families facing unexpected pregnancies. He responded that he supported such policies of \u201ccompassion.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stand for life, we have to care as much for newborns and mothers as we do for the unborn,\u201d Pence said. Asked if that included paid family leave and subsidized child care, Pence wouldn\u2019t say outright.\u00a0\nWhile some Republican state legislatures have paired abortion bans with additional funding for social programs \u2014 including to pay for diapers \u2014 Republican presidential candidates pushing for federal restrictions have offered scant details about what kind of policies they would champion to explicitly support pregnant people and families.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates pushing for increased government support for women and families say proposals like a federal paid family leave program and increased federal subsidies to address the nation\u2019s child care crisis are obvious family-friendly policies largely missing from the GOP campaign trail \u2014\u00a0though, they say, they don\u2019t replace the need for accessible and legal reproductive care.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen there have been opportunities to pass the policies that pregnant people and parenting people and families need to thrive, the vast majority of Republicans have opposed them,\u201d said Shaina Goodman, a policy expert with the National Partnership for Women and Families, which has for years championed a federal paid family and medical leave program. \u201cNone of these policies, however, account for what it means to be pregnant when you don\u2019t want to be and what the process of pregnancy and childbirth does to someone physically, emotionally \u2014 how it changes families, economically.\u201d\u00a0\nThe impact of abortion bans in post-Roe America is becoming more clear on a wide scale. An April study from the Society of Family Planning found a 6 percent drop in the number of legal abortions nationwide in the six months that followed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that put an end to federal abortion rights. The decline exceeded researchers\u2019 projections.\nEven as the battle over abortion access continues to play out in states and at the federal level, the data represents permanent impact to the patchwork of American families.\nThe leading Republican primary candidates are broadly supportive of abortion restrictions, but Pence has made federal abortion restrictions a cornerstone of his campaign, criticizing other GOP candidates for not going far enough on the issue. Pence\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nIn an interview with Politico, Pence said he supports public funding for anti-abortion counseling centers and to make adoption more affordable.\u00a0\nRepublican voters may be concerned by the impact of these changes. During a panel about the future of abortion restrictions at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s annual summit in Washington, D.C., in June, one woman who declined to share her name asked the panelists \u2014 two anti-abortion state lawmakers and a representative of a religious adoption agency \u2014\u00a0 to address the nation\u2019s overburdened foster care system.\n\u201cFor every action, there\u2019s a reaction,\u201d she said, adding that her grandchildren were previously in foster care.\u00a0\nJulie Kashen, a policy expert with the Century Foundation, a liberal think tank, said policies like increased federal subsidies for child care have broad bipartisan support. She said Republicans do champion child care and pointed to increases to the federal block grant program for child care during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden in April signed an executive order related to the federal block grant program that would cap child care fees for families and urge states to accept online applications to improve access.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n                          More from The 19th\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Nikki Haley\u2019s attacks on Kamala Harris keep coming\n                \n\n\n\n                    As Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signs abortion bill, her power in GOP is on full display\n                \n\n\n\n                    Why the DeSantis campaign is betting on the political power of \u2018mamas\u2019\n                \n\n\n\n\nKashen said support falls short among Republicans when talking about building a program that \u201cguarantees that every family has access to child care\u201d and that workers are paid competitive, livable wages.\nShe pointed to the Build Back Better Act championed by Biden, which at one point included significant funding to build out a pre-K system for the country that targeted both middle- and low-income families. The proposal cleared the Democrat-controlled House but did not make it out of the Senate. \u201cWe did not see Republican support for it in the Senate,\u201d Kashen said. \u201cAnd that was the closest we\u2019ve gotten in 50 years.\u201d\u00a0\nE.V. Osment of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which recently held an event with Pence to mark the anniversary of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision, said the group stood in support of federal financial and physical resources for families facing pregnancy. Osment said the group backs a bill introduced by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio that, among other things, increases the child tax credit and allows parents to use their Social Security benefits to take three months of paid parental leave.\nKashen said such policies can force families to decide between retirement security and caring for a new child.\u00a0\n\u201cMost Americans know what true policies of compassion are. They are what we\u2019ve been fighting for for decades, including child care for all, paid family and medical leave for all, support for people with disabilities and our aging loved ones. And the freedom to make decisions about when and what our families look like,\u201d Kashen said.\u00a0\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended for you\n\n\n\n\n\nA \u2018born alive\u2019 measure is one of the House GOP\u2019s priorities.
