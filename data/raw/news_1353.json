Wade, hundreds of people flooded the streets of downtown Fort Worth, marching, rallying, venting and promising that they\u2019d never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Texas.\nBut by mid-October, on the eve of the voter registration deadline, just a faithful few dozen gathered downtown for a Saturday evening rally. Lee Gaudreau, 49, said she was disappointed by the turnout.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think people understand that women are going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand the urgency of the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaudreau has always voted Democrat, but after the Supreme Court decision she decided to get more involved. Already that Saturday in October, she\u2019d helped organize a fundraiser, knocked on doors for Beto O\u2019Rourke and sent postcards to voters on behalf of Mothers Against Greg Abbott.\nBut in the end, she said, she realizes she gets just one vote. She\u2019s hoping Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans will come out in droves to register their displeasure with the state\u2019s new abortion laws by voting not just for governor and attorney general, but for candidates all the way down the ballot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Lee Gaudreau at the Bans Off Our Bodies Fort Worth protest.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ben Torres for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nPolling shows that a majority of voters in Texas oppose the state\u2019s near-total ban on abortion, and after a landslide victory for abortion access in conservative Kansas in August, many Democrats hoped the issue might mobilize enough voters to tip the 2022 elections in their favor.\nBut Texas has not seen the same surge in voter registrations as other states, and as of late August, voters ranked abortion as only the ninth-most-important problem facing the country, after inflation, the environment, gun control and immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn purple Tarrant County, where Democrats have recently won top-of-the-ticket races and Republicans dominate down-ballot, candidates, organizers and advocates are watching to see how the abortion issue shifts tight races \u2014 and what that means for the political salience of the issue going forward.\n\n\n\n\n    What you can expect from our elections coverage\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n              How we explain voting\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              We explain the voting process with election-specific voter guides to help Texans learn what is on the ballot and how to vote. We interview voters, election administrators and election law experts so that we can explain the process, barriers to participation and what happens after the vote is over and the counting begins.

Our readers\u2019 questions and needs help inform our priorities. We want to hear from readers: What do you better want to understand about the election process in Texas? If local, state or congressional elected officials were to successfully address one issue right now, what would you want it to be? What\u2019s at stake for you this election cycle? If we\u2019re missing something, this is your chance to tell us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              How we hold officials accountable\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              We do not merely recount what politicians say, but focus on what they do (or fail to do) for the Texans they represent. We aim to provide historical, legal and other kinds of context so readers can understand and engage with an issue. Reporting on efforts that make voting and engaging in our democracy harder is a pillar of our accountability work.

We need to choose what races we cover closely by using our best judgment of what\u2019s most noteworthy. We take into account factors like power, equity, interest and competitiveness in order to determine what warrants more resources and attention. Read more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              How we cover misinformation\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              In reporting on falsehoods and exaggerations, we clearly explain why it is untrue and how it may harm Texans. Sometimes, we choose to not write about misinformation because that can help amplify it. We\u2019re more likely to debunk falsehoods when they are spread by elected officials or used as a justification for policy decisions.

But she and some of her friends have been talking about the overturn of Roe v. Wade and what it means for young women like themselves. So when she heard about the Saturday evening rally in downtown Fort Worth, she went along with a friend.\nWhile she was there, she decided it was finally time to register to vote, just a few days before the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like all the things going on, and women\u2019s rights to make decisions for themselves getting taken away,\u201d she said as she filled out the paperwork.\nGelacio represents the great hope of the Democratic Party, this anticipated wave of young people and women newly energized to get involved in local politics by the rollback of abortion rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          From left: Arianna Reyna, 17, and Alexus Gelacio, 21, march outside of the Tarrant County Courthouse. Gelacio said she wasn\u2019t particularly politically active before the overturning of Roe v. Wade. At the Women\u2019s Wave rally, she decided to register to vote, just a few days before the deadline.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ben Torres for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nTexas did see a slight uptick in registered voters in the weeks after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, according to data provided by Derek Ryan, a Republican strategist and political data expert. About 40,000 more people were added to the rolls in the post-Roe period than during the same time frame in 2018.\nGov. Greg Abbott won in 2018 by 1.2 million votes; U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz beat Beto O\u2019Rourke that same year by 215,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is hardly the first time voters in Texas have been asked to mobilize to defend abortion access \u2014 and it\u2019s possible the voter rolls reflect that reality, said Ryan.\n\u201cI have a feeling that people [for] who abortion was a top-level issue were probably largely voting to begin with,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThey were probably already engaged. \u2026 We\u2019ve kind of already taken them into the equation, if you will.\u201d\nWithout the surge in new voter registrations, the question is whether the new voters who have registered since the Dobbs decision are more motivated than in previous years. Only 61% of voters who registered between late June and early October 2018 actually turned out come November, Ryan found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cliche and cheesy, but it\u2019s an old saying for a reason \u2014 this election will come down to turnout,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhether these individuals show up to vote or not is going to be the determining factor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA turnout election\nBut in a state like Texas and a year like 2022, Democrats will need more than just a modest bump in turnout to flip the script. Republicans haven\u2019t lost a statewide campaign in nearly three decades. They\u2019ve controlled both chambers of the Legislature for nearly two decades, and redistricting last year allowed them to further entrench their majorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Democrat Gwenn Burud during her 2018 campaign for state Senate. Burud is again running in Tarrant County to unseat Republican incumbent Kelly Hancock. Support for \u201creproductive rights and individual liberty\u201d is the first item on her platform these days, and she\u2019s quick to discuss the issue with voters.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Leslie Boorhem-Stephenson for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s part of why state Senate candidate Gwenn Burud is shaking the trees, hoping to turn out as many Democratic and undecided voters in her Tarrant County district as possible.\nOn a recent afternoon, Burud and her campaign manager knocked on doors in the quiet Fort Worth suburb of Haltom City, avoiding the house with the sign declaring \u201cJesus is my savior. Trump is my president.\u201d\nAt one house, a man in his 70s answered the door. He said he always voted Democrat and planned to vote for Burud, who is running to unseat Republican incumbent Kelly Hancock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about what they\u2019re doing to, you know, you guys,\u201d he said, pointing at Burud. \u201cYou just don\u2019t pass laws on \u2026 people.\u201d\n\u201cWomen?\u201d Burud asked, as he nodded eagerly.\nWhen Burud ran for Hancock\u2019s seat in 2018, her campaign website alluded to her support for \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201d When she declared a rematch for the 2022 election, her campaign literature simply said she wanted to see more women elected to office.\n\u201cThe word abortion was taboo in Tarrant County,\u201d Burud said. \u201cBecause of where I was running, there were a lot of moderates that you were trying to persuade, so I was told, \u2018Don\u2019t even go there.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen came the overturn of Roe v. Wade in late June.\n\n\n\n\n    Voting FAQ: 2024 Elections\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n              What happens after the Texas primary election?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              If no candidate gets a majority of votes in a primary race, the top two vote-getters will head to a May 28 primary runoff election. Whoever wins the runoff will be their party\u2019s nominee for that race in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThere is also a May 4 local election, and subsequent June 15 runoff, during which some local governments, such as cities, school districts and water districts, hold a general election for their elected offices or special elections to fill vacancies.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              How are the runoffs and general election different?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              In Texas, voters can only vote in one party\u2019s primary and runoff or in a third party\u2019s convention. During the November general election, voters can cast their ballot for any candidate, regardless of party affiliation. The candidate with the most votes wins, and there are no runoffs in state elections.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              What deadlines do I need to know to participate in the May local election?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Election Day for the local election is May 4. You must register or update your voter registration by April 4 to participate. Applications to vote by mail must be received by the early voting clerk in your county \u2014 not postmarked \u2014 by April 23. Early voting is scheduled for April 22-30. \n\n(For any local runoffs on June 15, the last day to register or update your voter registration is May 16. Applications to vote by mail must be received by the early voting clerk in your county \u2014 not postmarked \u2014 by June 4. Early voting is scheduled for June 3-11.)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              What deadlines do I need to know to participate in the May primary runoffs?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Election Day for the primary runoffs is May 28. You must register or update your voter registration by April 29 to participate. Applications to vote by mail must be received by the early voting clerk in your county \u2014 not postmarked \u2014 by May 17. Early voting is scheduled for May 20-24.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              What deadlines do I need to know to participate in the November general election?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Election Day for the general election is Nov. 5. You must register or update your voter registration by Oct. 7 to participate. Applications to vote by mail must be received by the early voting clerk in your county \u2014 not postmarked \u2014 by Oct. 25. Early voting is scheduled for Oct. 21 to Nov. 1.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Why does Texas have so many elections?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Yes, we noticed, too. Texas is one of just eight states that require primary candidates to win more than 50% of the vote before advancing to the general election. This adds runoff elections to the state\u2019s election calendar. The long ballots Texas voters face, which include partisan elections for judges, stem from the state\u2019s historic mistrust of government and desire to let Texans have a say at every level of government.\n            \n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nSupported by\u00a0\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe found out that a lot of women are more pro-choice than we thought,\u201d Burud said. \u201cNow, the messaging is like, run on abortion.\u201d\nBurud took the hint: Support for \u201creproductive rights and individual liberty\u201d is the first item on her platform these days, and she\u2019s quick to discuss the issue with voters.\nBurud lost to Hancock in 2018 by 8 points, and she\u2019s facing an even steeper climb this year with newly drawn district maps, a faltering economy and the usual disadvantage for the president\u2019s party. Former President Donald Trump won Hancock\u2019s old district by less than 2 percentage points in 2020. Under the newly drawn boundaries, he would have won by 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurud\u2019s campaign claims to have made more voter contacts than any other Legislative candidate in Tarrant County, and she said she\u2019s heard, again and again, that the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban goes too far. She said she has met many a \u201chouse divided,\u201d where a husband and wife are voting differently from each other, and Republicans who say they are switching sides.\nGreen, at TCU, said while diehard Republicans are unlikely to be swayed based on the abortion issue, some more moderate and independent subgroups may still be up for grabs. Less educated white women are always a potential wild card, particularly when it comes to gender issues.\n\u201cMost people are really particularly looking at this demographic group, which should be voting Republican based on all other measures,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut the question is, will their concern over reproductive issues be enough to motivate that group?\u201d\nAbortion advocacy groups like Planned Parenthood Texas Votes and Avow have been investing in voter outreach across party lines, hoping to capitalize on the disconnect between popular opinion and Texas\u2019 abortion laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cParty identification is just one reason people vote for the people that they do,\u201d said Drucilla Tigner, deputy director for Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \u201cWe know that people who identify as Republican [and] people who identify as independents also believe that abortion should not be illegal.\u201d\nIn Kansas, at least one-fifth of the people who voted to protect abortion access were registered Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          In purple Tarrant County, where Democrats have recently won top-of-the-ticket races and Republicans dominate down-ballot, candidates, organizers and advocates are watching to see how the abortion issue shifts tight races.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Ben Torres for The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut that was actually a referendum on abortion, and what we have in Texas is an election between three-dimensional, living, breathing human beings that have opinions on a wide variety of issues,\u201d said James Riddlesperger, a professor of political science at Texas Christian University.\nConvincing voters to see the connection between those three-dimensional candidates and their access to abortion is a tougher sell than a yes/no referendum. And while some people remain extremely motivated by abortion, other issues have taken the headlines \u2014 inflation, gun control, immigration, health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Barnes, chair of the Tarrant County Republican Party, said while he\u2019s heard more discussion about abortion this year than in past election cycles, he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s \u201ca top topic\u201d for voters.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t buy gas and you can\u2019t buy food \u2026 there\u2019s bigger issues that are majorly affecting everybody right now,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd those issues are top of the list of conversations with voters.\u201d\nThe abortion issue has at least balanced out the \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d between Republicans and Democrats going into the midterm elections, Riddlesperger said.\n\u201cDemocrats seem to be about as excited about the election as Republicans are,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, does that mean that there are going to be enough Democratic votes to win elections in Texas? I think that remains to be seen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf abortion does prove to be the key component to help Democrats stave off the expected Republican rout this midterm season, the real challenge will be in maintaining that momentum for years \u2014 perhaps decades \u2014 to come.\n\u201cEven if we do shift the tides here in Texas this November, and we do have a wave of folks who come in and who are sexual reproductive health champions, that is just the beginning,\u201d Tigner said. \u201cOne win does not mean that we\u2019ve won, and so no matter what, it\u2019s going to be a long fight.\u201d\nCaroline Covington contributed reporting. \nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood and Texas Christian University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
