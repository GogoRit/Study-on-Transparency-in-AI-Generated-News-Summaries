(photo: Shutterstock)\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown \nNation\nJanuary 1, 2021\n\n\nThe video-sharing app TikTok has also been a growing platform for political debate \u2014 \u00a0including on the hot-button topic of abortion.\u00a0\nTikTok\u2019s pro-life hashtag features content with 987.9 million views and the pro-choice hashtag has content with more than 1 one billion views, as young people all over the world post videos with their own perspectives on both sides of the issue. The app is a hugely popular platform for young people and 60% of TikTok users are ages 16-24. It features dance trends, challenges and funny sketches in the up-to-60-second video clip format.\"\u00a0\nWhile The New York Times recently drew attention to abortion activists on TikTok who confronted pro-life sidewalk counselors with loud music and mockery, there are also many vocal pro-life activists on the app and inspiring pro-life videos that have drawn millions of views.\nFive Christian young women, ages 15-21, are part of the pro-life culture on TikTok with their account @theprolifehive, which features pro-life videos with information, humor and personal stories.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Scheramic, a 21-year-old Catholic mom based in Ohio, told the Register that the account started from friendships formed within the pro-life community on Instagram and conversations where they realized they wanted to take pro-life content to TikTok. The account started in June and has more than 20,000 followers.\n\u00a0\nHelping Others Understand\nScheramic had her own conversion to being pro-life after an unplanned pregnancy in her freshman year of college.\u00a0\n\u201cI was in a horribly abusive relationship \u2014 like sexual, physical, emotional abuse,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA week after ending the relationship she discovered she was pregnant and \u201cimmediately scheduled an abortion.\u201d At the time, she said, \u201cI firmly believed that my life was going to be over if I got pregnant, that I would have to drop out of college.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe ended up deciding to tell her mother, who is Catholic, about the pregnancy and her mother\u2019s response was \u201cwhatever you do, please just go to a pregnancy center first.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI went to the pregnancy center and they were the most kind, supportive people,\u201d Scheramic said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pressure from them.\u201d She still planned on an abortion but returned to the center for an ultrasound where, she recalled, \u201cthe lady is looking for my daughter in my belly and I saw her and immediately I just started bursting into tears and I was like \u2018That\u2019s a baby, that\u2019s literally a baby, that\u2019s not a clump of cells\u2019 or all the things I thought it was going to be. It completely shocked me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI ended up keeping my daughter and she\u2019s amazing and she changed my life in all the most incredible ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t drop out of school. My life wasn\u2019t ruined and all those things that I really thought were going to happen, I had no idea they were going to be totally wrong, but also my life is going to be infinitely better because of her.\u201d\u00a0\nHer career path also contributed to her conversion, Scheramic said. \u201cI started studying embryonic and fetal development when training to be an ultrasound tech and found that biology and medicine affirmed the pro-life view.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nScheramic\u2019s advocacy on TikTok is part of her goal \u201cto help other girls and women in that situation, who can\u2019t see out of the immediate panic of finding out they\u2019re pregnant unexpectedly, to see how amazing life can be with your child even in ways you don\u2019t know.\u201d She said kids \u201cwho are mostly around our age group of our account: 15-18, early 20s, they might get pregnant unexpectedly \u2026 they also might not even understand the humanity of life in the womb.\u201d\nScheramic told part of her story in a TikTok that got more than 50,000 views in which she replied to the objection that rape victims don\u2019t want to carry their rapist\u2019s babies saying, \u201cHi, I am a rape victim who got pregnant. My daughter is sleeping upstairs. When you say all rape victims don\u2019t want to carry their rapist\u2019s child, you are erasing rape victims\u2019 voices and when you do that you insult my child too. You\u2019re saying that because of her father\u2019s actions and the way she was conceived that she doesn\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d While some commenters on the video argued that abortion should be available to rape victims, several other commenters were inspired to tell their own stories with one saying \u201cthank you for giving us our voice back \u2026 my son is sleeping in his room.\u201d\nThe account will occasionally hold debates on TikTok with those with opposing views.\u00a0\n\u201cWe really like to engage with people and share our sources and share our arguments,\u201d Scheramic said. The account also features a link to sources for pro-life arguments and registries for mothers who are in a crisis pregnancy and need assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTrends and Personal Stories\nPopular videos on the account include one that features the TikTok song Steven Universe while prolifehive member Annalise gestures to information about pregnancy care centers and the free resources that they offer, with an encouraging message to \u201cRemember that you\u2019re not alone in this journey!\u201d\u00a0\nAnother video participates in the trend of featuring Kanye West\u2019s \u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know\u201d soundbite from his 2005 Grammy speech to point out that most states do not report complications from abortion resulting in unreliable data on the safety of the abortion procedure.\u00a0\nAnother administrator of the prolifehive account is Julia, a 17-year-old from Ontario, Canada. She told the Register that she became very pro-life at the beginning of high school when one of her closest friends told her \u201cabout how when she was in the womb, doctors encouraged abortion for her because she would have been born with severe autism, she wouldn\u2019t have lived past two weeks, she would have had to talk through a computer.\u201d Her friend\u2019s parents were Christians and choose to have her friend who \u201ccame out a perfectly healthy baby.\u201d\u00a0\nJulia said the thought that \u201cmy best friend wouldn\u2019t be here\u201d made her do some research and form \u201creally solid opinions\u201d about abortion. She also was close to her friend\u2019s siblings who were adopted out of the foster care system. Julia says she would hear pro-abortion people talk about how rather than placing children in the foster care system \u201cthey should just be aborted and be spared their terrible quality of life,\u201d which made \u201cno sense\u201d to her being close to those who had been in system.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia said that she and the others who run the account \u201ctry and put a pro-life twist on trends that are happening within the app\u201d and also make \u201cdebunking videos where we take popular points that pro-choicers make and we try and deconstruct and debunk them.\u201d\nIn one video with thousands of views, Julia tackled part of the pro-abortion argument against putting up a baby for adoption, explaining that putting up a baby for adoption is not the same as putting a baby in the foster care system and citing statistics that \u201cper one child being put up for adoption there are 22 families looking to adopt.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVideos to Change Minds\u00a0\nAmber Rose Schneider, a 21-year-old Illinois Catholic studying graphic design, is another pro-life presence on the app. Her account @the_religious_hippie has more than 90,000 followers and she posts pro-life messages as well as information about the Catholic faith.\u00a0\nShe told the Register that her pro-life advocacy started when she came back to her faith after falling away in high school. \u201cI ended up getting in with a couple of rough crowds,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a lot of anxiety and seasonal depression.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter one night struggling with her lack of fulfillment, she \u201cdrove to church for the first time in eight years\u201d and \u201csat in the back, but I really felt peace there and that\u2019s what kick started me coming back.\u201d Schneider now attends the traditional Latin Mass where she feels a special \u201cconnection with God.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I found my voice for my faith again, I began expanding to pro-life content since fighting for the unborn is such an important job and a big part of our faith,\u201d she said. In one of her TikToks with 12,000 views, Schneider highlighted the abortion industry\u2019s connection to the eugenics movement by using the Mirror Reflection feature and the song \u201cTwins.\u201d She said that people should know about Planned Parenthood\u2019s link to eugenics and the quote from the group\u2019s founder Margaret Sanger that \u201cbirth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhether they agree with me or not, they\u2019ve watched my videos and maybe my video gave them something to think about,\u201d she said of her audience. \u201cThere\u2019s that side of it also, knowing my videos could change someone\u2019s mind on abortion.\u201d She has also been encouraged by the trend of teen moms on the app speaking out \u201cabout their experience and how their children have turned their lives around for the better.\u201d\nSchneider has faced death threats over her views and has also had TikTok remove some of her videos for allegedly \u201cnot following community guidelines,\u201d but she said the videos just had information about pregnancy and resources for crisis pregnancies. Despite such setbacks, she still believes TikTok is a \u201cgood tool because it can reach literally millions of people of all backgrounds, opinions, and lifestyles.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReaching a Vulnerable Demographic\nLila Rose is president and founder of the pro-life group Live Action which has the largest pro-life account on the app with 333,000 followers. The account features testimonies from young pro-lifers, responses to pro-abortion arguments, and information about human life in the womb.\u00a0\nRose told the Register that \u201c60% of U.S. TikTok users are between the ages 16-24, a very vulnerable demographic that the abortion industry targets daily with pro-abortion messages. TikTok gives our pro-life movement a unique opportunity to reach young people with content that is truthful, hard hitting, and pushes back on the abortion industry\u2019s lies.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe monitor the leading trends, and work every day to create the most viral life-saving content, and because of that, many of our videos have received millions of views,\u201d she commented.\u00a0\nOne recent video on the account, with more than 8 million views, shows footage of a father in an abortion business parking lot begging a woman not to abort their baby with the commentary that \u201cthere is so no such thing as my body, my choice when it comes to being pregnant \u2026 it\u2019s three parties: It\u2019s your body, the child\u2019s body with his own DNA, and the father.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRose said that Gen Z is \u201cnaturally interested in the debate around abortion and, we\u2019ve seen, very receptive to hearing more about the pro-life movement\u2019s reasoning.\u201d She added that \u201cthe comments section on our TikTok videos often includes thousands of young pro-lifers cheering us on \u2014 and those in opposition are quickly met with solid pro-life responses and reasoning learned from our presence on the platform.\u201d\nLive Action\u2019s TikTok account did face some obstacles and was even briefly banned from the platform in January for \u201cmultiple community violations,\u201d but Rose said they were \u201cnever given an example of a single violation. TikTok did not respond to requests for clarification, so we sounded the alarm that TikTok was now banning and removing the largest pro-life presence on the platform.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter public pressure and media inquiries, TikTok reinstated the account. \u201cFollowing a review, we have determined that there were no violations of our Community Guidelines, and the issue was the result of a human error by a moderator,\u201d they stated at the time.\u00a0\nRose is \u201cglad TikTok course corrected\u201d and said that it\u2019s important to be able to \u201cuse your social media presence to make your mark on history.\u00a0\n\u201cAbortion is the greatest human rights abuse of our time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the knowledge, passion, and opportunity to change hearts and minds and save lives. We should utilize every tool in our hand to save every preborn life we can.\u201d\n\n\nKeywords: \ntiktok\npro-life\n\n\n\n\nLauretta Brown Lauretta Brown is the Register\u2019s Washington-based staff writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Comments\n\nShow Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\nLatest News\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS House Passes Bill to Ban or Force Sale of TikTok\n\nThe measure passed in an overwhelming bipartisan 352-65 vote.
