We are advocating for the right to reproductive health by sharing the experiences of women who didn\u2019t have choice, and others who faced multiple barriers when trying to access the abortions they needed. These experiences take place, more often than not, in secrecy and silence, and we are determined to change that,\u201d Project Lead, Laura Paris told MaltaToday.\nThe campaign, which is supported by the Young Progressive Beings and Break the Taboo Malta is focused on the power of shared experience, in the hope that it will encourage the public to empathise more directly. Paris is assisted by Emily Galea, Liza Caruana-Finkel and Alessandra Baldacchino.\n\u201cFrom the physical and mental agony to the local lack of financial and psychosocial support for vulnerable women, the stories truly embody the injustice people in Malta are suffering,\u201d Paris said.\nParis observes how due to the national criminalisation of abortion and the taboo surrounding it, the issue is scarcely discussed in the absence of shame, fear or anger. She said people needed to unlearn, rethink and reconstruct their opinions on abortion.\n\u201cThrough this process, we discovered the unspoken trauma, suffering, and loneliness that the blanket ban on abortion has brought about. When COVID-19 restrictions came into place, the urge for reform became particularly prominent. This is due to the current travel restrictions, the rise in domestic abuse, and the decrease in availability of contraceptives which are currently limiting women and pregnant people\u2019s options even further,\u201d she said.\nParis said the campaign plans on compiling the testimonies into a formal letter,\u00a0 addressed to the eponymous \u201cdear decision makers\u201d in a bid to change the views of lawmakers.\n\u201cHealthcare professionals are also encouraged to join in and recount their experiences. It is through these collective voices that we would like to convey to the Maltese public as well as the government that abortion services are essential,\u201d Paris said.\nOn a social level, Paris hopes that the campaign can help correct misconceptions on abortion, paving the way for a healthy debate in Malta. \u201cThe next step is exercising more mindfulness of the various reasons why people have abortions, and understanding that hate and shame have no place in this debate.\u201d\nBy sharing real experiences, the campaign aims at not only reducing the stigma of abortion but facilitate a constructive debate that is based on evidence and experiential knowledge.\n\u201cBeing pro-choice does not mean believing that every pregnancy should end in abortion, but simply that you can accept, empathise and support those who choose to have abortions. We are not here to tell people what to think; we want to facilitate solidarity and unity amongst the people of this country,\u201d she said.\nThe feedback to the campaign has been positive, from both women submitting testimonies, as well as the general public. \u201cMany people are afraid to publicly announce that they are supportive of abortion and this initiative, but the support is there. Hopefully, this is something that we can change. Abortion shouldn\u2019t have to be a taboo subject,\u201d Paris said.\n\u2018All walks of life after affected by the ban\u2019 \nParis said one of the most striking things the campaign had noticed so far, is that women of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life need abortions and are negatively affected by the total ban.\n\u201cThis became evident not only from the few stories we have collected but also from conversations with peers and activists. In some cases, we have also observed trails of long-lasting harm that has stemmed from negative experiences associated directly with the blanket ban, including the high level of abortion stigma in Malta,\u201d she said.\nThis reality is coupled with the local lack of institutional support and other factors that are accounted for in countries where abortion is legal and accessible, creating an urgent call for action in Malta. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Calleja is features editor at MaltaToday \n\n More from Laura Calleja\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise \nContact \nDigital Edition\nSMS Alerts\n\n\nTerms and Conditions \nPrivacy Policy \nCookie Policy \nArchives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediaToday is an independent media house based in Malta.
