But for many U.S. medical school students and residents who want to learn about abortions, options are scarce.\nAnd new restrictions are piling up: Within the past year, bills or laws seeking to limit abortion education have been proposed or enacted in at least eight states. The changes are coming from abortion opponents emboldened by new limits on the procedure itself, as well as a pending Supreme Court decision that could upend the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite terrifying what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Ian Peake, a third-year medical student in Oklahoma, where the governor on April 12 signed a measure outlawing most abortions.\nWATCH: Florida and Kentucky become the latest states to pass new restrictive abortion laws\nAbortion training is not offered at Oklahoma\u2019s two medical schools and education on the topic is limited. Aspiring doctors who want to learn about it typically seek out doctors providing abortions outside the traditional medical education system.\nPeake, 32, said if he wanted to learn to do colonoscopies, for example, he could work with school staff to shadow a doctor doing research or working in a clinic.\n\u201cThat would be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do the same for abortion, that\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d He said it took him six months to find a provider willing to teach him.\nNevada medical student Natasha McGlaun got outside training and created a workshop on how to perform a standard medical procedure used in abortions. She offers it at night, in her own time.\nThe 27-year-old is the daughter of \u201cpro-feminist\u201d parents and the mother of two young girls whose right to reproductive choice she wants to protect.\n\u201cIt was kind of a joke in my family: If people tell me I can\u2019t do something, I\u2019m going to do it twice as hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of feel this moral, righteous drive to go for it.\u201d\n\u2018Glaringly absent\u2019 lessons\nU.S. physician education typically includes four years of medical school, where students learn the basics of general medicine and hands-on patient care. They graduate with a medical degree that officially makes them doctors. Most then spend at least three years in residency programs where they receive intense on-the-job training and specialty skills.\nU.S. medical schools require students to complete a clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology, but there is no mandate that it include abortion education. At the post-graduate level, OB-GYN residency programs are required by an accrediting group to provide access to abortion training, though residents who object can opt out of performing abortions.\nOB-GYNs perform most U.S. abortions, followed by family medicine specialists. But these aren\u2019t always the first doctors that women encounter when they learn of an unintended pregnancy. Abortion rights supporters argue all physicians should know enough about the procedure to inform and counsel patients, and that such education should start in medical school.\nREAD MORE: Abortions stop in Kentucky as rights groups seek to block new law\nIn 2020, Stanford University researchers said they found that half of medical schools included no formal abortion training or only a single lecture.\n\u201cAbortion is one of the most common medical procedures,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYet abortion-related topics are glaringly absent from medical school curricula.\u201d\nMcGlaun helped sponsor a measure last year that asked the American Medical Association to support mandated abortion education in medical schools, with an opt-out provision. The influential group has long opposed curriculum mandates and turned down the proposal, but it said it supports giving medical students and residents the chance to learn about abortion and opposes efforts to interfere with such training.\nFurther restrictions\nLegislative efforts to curb abortion target all levels of medical education.\nAn Idaho law enacted last year exemplifies the trend. It bars using tuition and fees for abortion and related activities in school-based clinics at institutions that receive state funds.\nOther efforts include a Wisconsin bill that would bar employees of the University of Wisconsin and its hospitals from participating in abortions, including training. It failed to advance in March but its sponsor plans to reintroduce the measure. Similar proposals target public universities in Missouri and Ohio.\nDivya Jain\u2019s introduction to abortion came not at her Missouri medical school \u2014 where she said the procedure is rarely discussed \u2014 but at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Kansas. She was a clinic volunteer and saw the hurdles out-of-state women faced in obtaining the procedure. Some mistakenly ended up at a crisis pregnancy center across the street that tried to change their minds, Jain said.\nREAD MORE: Florida governor signs law banning abortions after 15 weeks\nJain, 23, said her first experience observing an abortion was \u201canti-climactic,\u201d far from the scary image she\u2019d heard opponents describe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a normal in-house procedure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just patients seeking medical treatment.\u201d\nAt that moment, she knew she wanted to provide abortions. \u201cIt was like a snap of finger. That kind of changed it for me,\u201d said Jain, who is studying public policy at Harvard while on leave from medical school at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\nThe daughter of open-minded but traditional parents who immigrated to Kansas from India, Jain recalls growing up feeling trapped by her family\u2019s traditional culture and a conservative white community where abortion was never discussed.\n\u201cI liked to stir the pot\u201d and push boundaries, she said.\nJain knows the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on whether to uphold Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy could drastically change the U.S. abortion landscape. Regardless of the decision \u2014 expected by summer \u2014 Jain said her goal is set: to perform abortions in \u201chostile\u201d states where providers are scarce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for patients to get the care that patients deserve and need, and I just think it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Jain said.\nExpanding training\nDr. Keith Reisinger-Kindle, 33, associate director of the OB-GYN residency program at Wright State University\u2019s medical school in Dayton, Ohio, said his aim to boost abortion training \u201chas been an uphill battle\u201d because of legislative obstacles.\nWhen he arrived at the school almost two years ago, he said, \u201cthere was zero formal abortion education available.\u201d He created and implemented abortion coursework for medical students and residents, with support from his university, and offers training at a nearby clinic where he also performs abortions.\nWATCH: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signs law banning abortion\nThe physician said a state legislator has lobbied university administrators to fire him. And in December, Ohio\u2019s governor signed into law a measure that limits doctors who work at state institutions from working as backup doctors at abortion clinics when rare complications occur. The clinic where Reisinger-Kindle works is suing to block the law.\n\u201cThere are days that are certainly challenging,\u201d Reisinger-Kindle said. Young doctors eager to learn help keep him going. The program currently has 24 residents. They can opt out of abortion training, but he said nearly all have chosen to participate \u201cin at least some capacity.\u201d\nHe fears more abortion restrictions are coming, but adds: \u201cIn the long-term, I believe we will get this right. I just hope that my students don\u2019t have to suffer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                A imaging table inside the Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood St. Louis Region, Missouri's sole abortion clinic, in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S. May 28, 2019.
