Twenty-one were performed due to a life endangering physical condition. Fourteen were performed due to rape. Three were performed due to incest.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lawmakers sign off on expanding medical marijuana licenses for Black farmers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n New College of Florida to receive millions, some of the money includes strings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mega Millions jackpot at $875 million for Tuesday drawing, Powerball jackpot rolling over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Messi to miss Argentina friendlies in US due to muscle injury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mega Millions and Powerball have racked up some massive jackpots\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Abortion\n\nFirst published on February 21, 2022 / 5:45 PM EST\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
