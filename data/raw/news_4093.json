The results are predictably harmful to human rights.\nFrom its inception, the Commission was recognized by many as an exercise in doublespeak, designed to provide an intellectual foundation for rolling back human rights protections under the guise of advancing them. Following five public meetings this past year and a lawsuit challenging the effort, the Commission released a 60-page draft report on July 16, initiating a two-week public comment period. Approved unanimously by all 11 commissioners, the report confirms previously expressed concerns\u2014including in our posts here and here\u2014about what the body would recommend. Here we outline the top eight problems with the Commission\u2019s report:\n\nThe report rejects reproductive and LGBTQI+ rights: Rather than affirming women\u2019s right to choose and marriage equality as protected human rights, the Commission ignores international human rights law and explicitly dismisses these rights as \u201cdivisive social and political controversies.\u201d This conclusion does not reflect any serious examination of international law. It reflects the longstanding anti-abortion and anti-marriage equality views of the commissioners handpicked by Pompeo to advance his agenda. Pompeo\u2019s mandate that the Commission focus on U.S. \u201cfounding principles\u201d and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in its work\u2014instructions the Commission\u2019s chair described as \u201cterse\u201d\u2014also helped to support this anachronistic approach. Indeed, both international human rights law and U.S. domestic law have developed significantly since 1948 and the U.S. founding respectively, but the Commission did not engage with the modern laws that would not support its foregone conclusions.\n\n\nThe report unduly elevates religious freedom and property rights above other rights: As we and others predicted, Pompeo\u2019s commission furthers his agenda of centering religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy. At the report launch on July 16, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, blessed Pompeo\u2019s \u201cnoble\u201d mission, repeating the Secretary of State\u2019s own oft-stated belief that unalienable rights comefrom God. Celebrating what the Commission sees as the dominant role of \u201cProtestant Christianity\u201d and \u201cBiblical teachings\u201d in America\u2019s founding and the American \u201cnational spirit,\u201d the report finds that the \u201cforemost\u201d unalienable rights are religious liberty and property rights. As noted above\u2014and as was predictable based on the views of some Commissioners and its hearings\u2014with this embrace of religious freedom comes the erasure of women\u2019s and LGBTQI+ rights. As such it is contrary to international law, which makes clear that all rights are equal and religious beliefs can never be used to justify violations of the rights of women, girls, or LGBTQI+ people.\n\n\nThe report calls for rights\u2019 hierarchies: While the report correctly acknowledges rights\u2019 interdependence and that the 1948 UDHR \u201cdoes not explicitly establish a hierarchy of rights,\u201d it openly calls for hierarchies of rights based on U.S. national interests and traditions, including in religious freedom and anti-trafficking. Flouting decades of developments showing the equal value and interdependence of all rights, the Commission endorses hierarchies among civil and political rights (elevating religious freedom and property rights over others such as non-discrimination or the right to vote, for example) and between civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural ones.\n\n\nThe report limits human rights by undermining human rights treaties: The report\u2019s table of contents reveals a feature strikingly odd to anyone with a basic understanding of human rights development since the 1960s. The report devotes many pages to the 1948 UDHR, but does not analyze the rights set out in the nine core human rights treaties developed over the last 70 years, of which the U.S. government has ratified three and signed four. Indeed, the only section of the report that examines the \u201cpositive law\u201d of treaties questions their value and asks whether they should in fact be accepted as international legal obligations.While it may seem baffling that a report dedicated to examining human rights contains almost no analysis of binding human rights treaties, Pompeo has long made clear his intention to limit some rights and elevate others (such as religious freedom, as described above). His commission advances this goal by downplaying the rights protections set out in foundational treaties, including particularly the post-1948 recognition of reproductive and LGBTQI+ rights.\n\n\nThe report rolls back existing rights protections and limits the evolution of future rights protection: Over time, the protective reach of human rights has evolved to ensure protections for marginalized groups and for rights not set out in the UDHR in 1948. The Commission rails against the so-called expansion of protections and its purported negative effects, although never provides actual evidence of any harms caused by so-called rights proliferation. Inspired by what the Commission sees as the UDHR\u2019s \u201csmall set of rights,\u201d the Commission creates a new set of strict criteria for recognizing \u201cnew\u201d rights while recommending caution in their application. Here, treaties that bind the United States finally get a look, but stasis is still all but guaranteed by criteria that the right be \u201cclosely rooted\u201d in the \u201cexplicit language\u201d of the UDHR \u201cas it was written and understood by the framers of that document.\u201d Criteria also include whether a right is \u201cwidely recognized and accepted by the American people\u201d or if there is \u201csovereign consent to the development,\u201d which risk making rights subject to majoritarian whim and giving repressive governments continued license to block the development of norms under the cover of \u201csovereignty.\u201d\n\n\nThe report de-prioritizes economic, social, and cultural rights: International human rights law guarantees basic socioeconomic rights, including to housing, health, education, and work. These rights are equal to and interdependent with civil and political rights. The Commission rightly states that socioeconomic rights should be \u201ctaken seriously\u201d in U.S. foreign policy. Yet in the same breath, the Commission perfunctorily concludes that it is \u201creasonable\u201d for the United States to treat socioeconomic rights \u201cdifferently\u201d and that the United States should \u201cemphasiz[e]\u201d civil and political rights over socioeconomic ones. In so doing, the report advances a harmful and regressive view of rights that cuts against the protections of the UDHR itself and the core human rights treaties.\n\n\nThe report pays mere lip service to pressing human rights issues: While the report devotes many pages to and offers a full-scale defense of religious freedom, other issues that Pompeo and the Commission say are important receive little attention. For example, in introducing the report, Pompeo stated that the United States is in a position to \u201chelp\u201d women who suffer \u201cthe most human rights abuses.\u201d Yet the report fails to devote any substantive attention to people experiencing harm because of their gender\u2014or any other\u2014identity. Perversely, the Commission seeks to take away women\u2019s rights\u2014dismissing abortion and affirmative action as \u201cissues\u201d not rights\u2014and references the status of women only in the context of historical developments in the post-civil war era. Similarly, other challenges to human rights identified during the hearings and report\u2019s launch\u2014for example, at the launch the Commission chair singled out \u201cthreats to human freedom and dignity\u201d that accompany technological advances such as \u201cartificial intelligence, biotechnology, data collection, sophisticated surveillance techniques\u201d \u2014receive scant substantive attention in the report.\n\n\nThe report sees the world and the United States\u2019 role in it through the looking glass: The report rightly notes that the \u201ccredibility of U.S. advocacy for human rights abroad\u201d depends on how much its own citizens enjoy rights domestically. Yet it is quick to identify the harms of other states such as China, Cuba, and Venezuela without turning rights analysis inward in any meaningful way. Instead, at the report launch and through his op eds, Pompeo shows that he prefers hagiography. For example, he rejected as \u201cslander\u201d the New York Times\u2019 1619 Project, an important effort to reckon with the role of slavery in the United States. So, too, is it difficult to see how the United States can lead through the \u201cpower of example\u201d and \u201cvigorously champion human rights in foreign policy,\u201d when the report openly favors nativism when it comes to rights. For example, the report encourages nations to center their own sovereignty and not global norms in understanding their international human rights obligations.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nIt is clear that the report tries to provide a foundation for a regressive, harmful approach to human rights and foreign policy. But does this report actually matter? Should those who genuinely care for human rights just ignore it? In some ways, it seems inconsequential and easy to dismiss. It was set up by a deeply abusive government, the commissioners were handpicked for their anti-rights views, and they were told to downplay binding human rights law in their deliberations. The report is far outside the mainstream of international human rights theory, law, and practice. It ignores actually existing international law. And its pro-religious freedom (for some) and anti-women and anti-LGBTQI+ agendas are clear. It reads, deceptively, like a human rights-oriented take on U.S. foreign policy from a post-World War II era of purported U.S. moral leadership, a period that has been romanticized far beyond its reality for many Americans or for individuals in the countries the United States engaged.\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. It is clear that Pompeo intends to use the report to form part of the intellectual backbone of his personal policy agenda to undo decades of positive developments in human rights and to center religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy at the expense of other rights. And the Commission\u2019s thin veneer as a body that engages the public through hearings and consultations risks its findings being seen as reflective of having the \u201csupport\u201d of the American people, a criterion it has identified as part of determining whether a right should be recognized. There is a real risk that the report will be cited by anti-rights government officials in the United States and abroad to justify their rights-denying actions and policies. As such, the report, and the broader regressive agenda of which it is a part, provide a dangerous albeit instructive roadmap for Pompeo\u2019s agenda with regards to human rights. For this reason, it should be taken seriously, and also warrants widespread rebuke.\nPhoto by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/POOL/AFP via Getty Images.\nFiled under:Commission on Unalienable Rights, Human Rights, Mike Pompeo, reproductive rightsSignups for A.M. & P.M.
