Jackson Women\u2019s Health, a decision that could overturn Roe v. Wade and send abortion legislation back to the states, organizers of the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., have renewed their efforts to support state-level marches and activism.\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, Connecticut saw its first March for Life held on the steps of the State Capitol in Hartford. Organizers estimated there were about 3,000 marchers.\nAmong the speakers were Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life; Archbishop Leonard Blair of Hartford; evangelical archbishop Leroy Bailey, senior pastor at The First Cathedral in Bloomfield; Sister of Life Mariae Agnus Dei; Christopher Healy, executive director of the Connecticut Catholic Conference; Peter Wolfgang, executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut; Lisa Maloney, president of the Connecticut Pregnancy Care Center Coalition, Christina Bennett of Live Action and State Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect.\nArchbishop Blair told the Register as he prepared to march with the throng through the streets of downtown Hartford:\n\u201cWith the prospect that the battle against abortion will go to the state level, we need to focus our efforts all the more at the local level. I am gratified to see so many people here today \u2026 and thankful for the chance to publicly stand up for life.\u201d\nConnecticut has historically been one of the nation\u2019s most aggressively pro-abortion states, and pro-life advocates have struggled to make any meaningful changes to the law.\nBut their voices were heard this week. Mancini spoke with the Register at the Capitol.\u00a0\n\u201cConnecticut is a hostile environment to life. And I\u2019ve witnessed personally that when we can rally the grassroots in any state, but especially in a hostile environment, it can have such power, not just in the people themselves, so they feel they\u2019re not alone, but more importantly in the beautiful things that happen when people come together.\u201d\nShe emphasized that, with the Dobbs decision on the horizon, \u201cfor the first time, in my lifetime, we have the possibility of the question of abortion returning to the state legislative branches.\u201d\nLISTEN: \"This is a spiritual battle at its highest level...\" @jeannemfl tells @TomWehner today at Connecticut's @March_for_Life #WhyWeMarch #CTMarchForLife @NCRegister #LoveWins pic.twitter.com/fDyaeb7HLf\u2014 National Catholic Register (@NCRegister) March 23, 2022 \n\u201cSo it is all the more important that we're here today in Connecticut,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause then it will be the legislators in Connecticut deciding the laws and whether life is protected or not. And every voice matters in Connecticut. You must let your legislators know where you stand.\u201d\nShe thanked the Catholic Church for its firm commitment to the unborn and human dignity at all stages of life, in particular commending the support of Archbishop Blair.\n\u201cThis is the most preeminent issue in terms of social justice and human rights, and its beautiful [to see the Church] preach about it from the pulpit. We have that a lot in [my home] Diocese of Arlington. I know not everyone has that, but you certainly have that here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPrayer First\nThe night before the march, St. Mary\u2019s Church in New Haven hosted a \u201cMass for Life\u201d and reception featuring Mancini.\u00a0\nArchbishop Blair celebrated the Mass in the recently renovated church that houses the tomb of Blessed Michael McGivney, founder of the Knights of Columbus.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 250 faithful attended, including Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly and his wife, Vanessa, members of the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus, whose headquarters are in New Haven, members of the Sisters of Life, parishioners and pro-life leaders from throughout the state.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpiritual Battle\nParishioner Lori Myers noted the central role of prayer \u2014 in particular the sacrifice of the Mass \u2014 for Catholics in the pro-life movement and the March for Life\u2019s efforts to support grassroots initiatives at the state level.\n\u201cAs a Catholic, the right to life from conception to natural death is front and center of our beliefs. Because there is so much spiritual warfare associated with this cause, it\u2019s vital we as a Catholic community come together to pray on the eve of such a momentous and historical occasion as the March for Life in Hartford tomorrow.\u201d\nFather Ryan Lerner, pastor of St. Mary\u2019s parish, told the Register, \u201cIt\u2019s very special to me that St. Mary\u2019s has been chosen to host this year\u2019s archdiocesan Mass for Life [and reception]. Our parish is home to a tremendous number of families. Seeing so many children each weekend is a reminder of the sacredness of all human life, from conception until natural death.\u201d\u00a0\nFather Lerner added, \u201cWe are also excited to participate in the local March for Life in Hartford \u2014 witnessing in the public square alongside so many others who are working to transform our culture into one shaped by the gospel of life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCulture of Death\u2019s \u2018Mercilessness\u2019\nIn his homily, Archbishop Blair noted Connecticut\u2019s reputation as a state where anti-life legislation has contributed to a prevalent culture of death. \u201cWe find ourselves in a cloud of darkness and death,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the bright light of God\u2019s joy and mercy is always with us.\u201d\u00a0\nArchbishop Blair described the prevalence of abortion in American society as a sign of \u201cmercilessness.\u201d\nHe emphasized that Catholics believe \u201clife from conception until natural death is sacred to God, the author of life,\u201d and that, \u201cin the end, all will be accountable to him.\u201d\u00a0\nIn the face of the evil of abortion, he said, the faithful feel \u201cthe righteous indignation of the Old and New Testament prophets,\u201d and Jesus himself \u201cpromised harsh judgment to the unrepentant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the face of mercilessness, the archbishop called on the faithful to remember that \u201cfaith in Jesus is faith in the Redeemer whose heart is an ocean of mercy for even the worst of sinners.\u201d\u00a0\nHe urged the faithful to pray for both an end to abortion and the conversion of abortionists and their supporters.\u00a0\n\u201cLet us never lose faith in the perfect justice and the perfect mercy of God,\u201d he concluded.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe End of Roe?\nFollowing the Mass, the parish hosted a reception in the church hall featuring remarks by Supreme Knight Kelly and the March for Life\u2019s Mancini. Kelly welcomed Mancini, Archbishop Blair and the Sisters of Life, thanking the sisters in particular for the joy they radiate through their service to the Church.\u00a0\nHe emphasized, too, that with the possibility of the Dobbs v. Jackson case bringing an end to Roe v. Wade this coming June, state marches \u201cwill become center stage,\u201d particularly in states like Connecticut, which has enshrined abortion in its state constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nMancini commended the Knights in her talk, saying, \u201cThe March for Life would not exist if not for the Knights of Columbus. They are the backbone of the pro-life movement\u201d in the United States.\u00a0\nMancini listed a myriad of initiatives supported by the Knights, including the Special Olympics, the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, the Sisters of Life, and the March for Life itself.\u00a0\nThe March for Life is wholly committed to grassroots advocacy in state legislatures, she said: \u201cWe are at a cultural crossroads in terms of the legality of abortion.\u201d If Dobbs overturns Roe, \u201cthe question of abortion will return to the legislative branches of the states.\u201d\u00a0\nState marches, such as the Connecticut March for Life, are vital to the pro-life strategy in combating the culture of death nationally, she underscored.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nMancini also noted that the national march has historically been held on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade in January. Temperatures in 2022 were well below freezing with the wind chill, and she confessed she was looking forward to better marching weather in the local state marches.\nIn 2022, the March for Life\u2019s state march program will hold five state marches: Connecticut, Virginia, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. In 2023, that number will double to 10, then doubling again each year until all 50 states have an annual March for Life in their capital cities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nKeywords: \nmarch for life\nconnecticut\nabortion\n\n\n\n\nErika J.
