Georgia Tech outlined its policy changes in its new \u201cRegistered Students Organization Policy,\u201d which became effective in August.\u201cApproval or denial of a Group\u2019s Charter application, or a determination by the Center for Student Engagement that a Group\u2019s Chartering application is not complete, will not be based on the mission, goals, or beliefs of the Group or any other content- or viewpoint-based determination,\u201d the policy stresses.Get Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.SubscribeIn April, Students for Life at Georgia Tech filed a lawsuit against Georgia Tech officials, the school\u2019s Student Government Association and the regents of the University System of Georgia after their funding request for the event featuring King, the niece of late civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was denied. The students were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal institute specializing in religious liberty cases.\u201cIn the summer of last year, Students for Life at Georgia Tech submitted a request to the Student Government Association for funding the King event out of the pool of mandatory student activity fees available for such events. \u2026\u00a0 Such requests are routinely \u2018fast tracked\u2019 without any discussion,\u201d ADF explained.\u00a0According to ADF, members of the Student Government Association expressed concern about \u201cthe content and viewpoints that Students for Life and King would present at the event.\u201d Citing King\u2019s \u201cinherently religious\u201d lifestyle and concerns that some students would be offended by her point of view, the SGA denied the request.Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, described the SGA\u2019s refusal to fund the King event as an example of \u201chostility toward the First Amendment.\u201d He cheered Georgia Tech\u2019s decision to \u201crevise their policies to treat all student organizations fairly, regardless of view point.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so important that public colleges and universities exemplify the First Amendment values they are supposed to be teaching to students. Thankfully, Georgia Tech has shown its renewed commitment to these principles by taking quick corrective action,\u201d Langhofer said.Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, also issued a statement praising Georgia Tech for establishing the \u201cRegistered Students Organization Policy.\u201d \u201cWe are hopeful that Georgia Tech\u2019s decisive policy changes will set an example for universities around the country,\u201d she said.Now that Georgia Tech has agreed to implement the \u201cRegistered Students Organization Policy,\u201d ADF attorneys have dismissed the lawsuit.Georgia Tech is not the only college in the United States to face accusations of suppressing students\u2019 First Amendment rights.Just two months after the Georgia Tech Students for Life filed their lawsuit, the student senate at Florida State University removed\u00a0its president, Jack Denton, after his text messages proclaiming that groups like Black Lives Matter and the American Civil Liberties Union have taken positions that contradict with the teachings of the Catholic Church became public.Two weeks ago, Denton filed a lawsuit against FSU, claiming that the student senate ousted him from his position \u201cin retaliation for his private religious speech.\u201d The ADF is representing Denton as he seeks \u201creinstatement, compensation, and the expungement of all records relating to the Senate\u2019s retaliatory and discriminatory actions against him.\u201dWas this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
