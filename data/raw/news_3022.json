Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade.    Left-wing activists at ShutDownDC and OurRightsDC claimed responsibility for the protest on Thursday.The abortion activists also stood outside the DC-area hotel where the event was hosted to protest. One person held up a sign that read, \"Jesus [loves] abortion\" with a heart.Vincent Vertuccio, a freshman at George Washington University who was profiled by The New York Times for his climate activism, was also part of ShutDownDC's protest.\u00a0    He mocked the pro-life attendants as \"fascists\" on Twitter, saying that the pregnancy center \"lies to patients, endangers pregnant people, and is part of a national anti-abortion network.\"  A group of anti-abortion protesters crashes the Women's March Action Rally for Reproductive Rights at Mariachi Plaza in Los Angeles, California, on Oct. 8, 2022.

She said a few of the protesters sat at the same table as a woman who brought her toddler to the event and tearfully shared how the crisis pregnancy center helped her keep her baby.  The crisis pregnancy center's website states they offer women maternity and baby items, counseling, parenting classes, adoption and housing referrals as well as post abortion support among other resources, all free of charge.
