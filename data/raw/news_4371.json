(Photo: TFHA)\nIn Tonga, the Government has deemed sexual and reproductive health services as essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic. On this World AIDS Day, we are reminded that eliminating stigma and discrimination, and following a human rights-based and gender-responsive approach are key to successfully responding to both COVID-19 and HIV.\nWhile sex work is often seen as a contentious issue, with many conflicting viewpoints in societies around the world, one thing is clear \u2013 sex workers have a fundamental right to accessing sexual and reproductive health care.\n\u201cWe work with female sex workers throughout Tonga \u2013 in all corners of the country, even on the most remote islands,\u201d says Katherine Mafi, Programme Manager at the Tonga Family Health Association (TFHA). \u201cWe\u2019re the only NGO working on sexual and reproductive health in the country.\u201d\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve always been very passionate about this work,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s quite fulfilling, going home at the end of the day knowing that you\u2019re helping people, possibly even saving a life.\u201dKatherine Mafi speaks to a group of women about sexual and reproductive health and rights. (Photo: TFHA)\nTFHA has been working on sexual and reproductive health and rights for more than four decades in Tonga, offering a range of services, such as family planning, maternal and child health support, fertility and counselling assistance, as well as HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) prevention and voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT).\nSince 2017, their work to empower female sex workers and ensure they have access to comprehensive, high quality sexual and reproductive health services has been supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through the Global Fund-supported Multi-Country Western Pacific Integrated HIV/TB Programme.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, sexual and reproductive health has been deemed an essential service by the government, with all efforts made to avoid discontinuation of services.\n\u201cThe global health crisis we\u2019re experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to exacerbate social and economic inequalities, and increase vulnerabilities of certain marginalized groups \u2013 including sex workers \u2013 to HIV,\u201d says Gayane Tovmasyan, Programme Manager at UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji. \u201cEnsuring that these sexual and reproductive health services have been able to continue unhindered has been vitally important.\u201d\nWhile prevalence of HIV in Tonga is low, the rates of STIs are high with a reported 22 cases per 100,000 people and increasing. Female sex workers are one of the groups who have an elevated risk.\nAs in many other countries in the world, in Tonga sex work is criminalized, and sex workers face structural and interpersonal violence that negatively affect their health and well-being. This includes police violence, exclusion from health services, stigmatization and marginalization. Together, this contributes to an increased likelihood of acquiring HIV and STIs than the general population.SD Duo is a low-cost rapid point-of-care test that can simultaneously detect antibodies for HIV and syphilis.\nOne of the areas in which UNDP has provided support, is the procurement of much needed diagnostic equipment \u2013 specifically, SD Duo rapid testing kits \u2013 which allow for quick and accurate community-based testing of at-risk populations for HIV and syphilis. The testing is being done through TFHA\u2019s network of service points, including three permanent clinics and 15 community-based distributors.\n\u201cWhat we were lacking was resources to be able to conduct community-based testing,\u201d said Katherine, adding \u201cthe SD Duo tests are a game-changer.\u201dImplementing the SD Duo point-of-care test kits has enhanced the sexual and reproductive health services on offer from TFHA and also contributed to extending their geographical reach. Testing for HIV and STIs can now be done in even the most far flung communities among Tonga\u2019s 169 islands.\nIn 2018-2019, 583 female sex workers were tested for HIV and provided with prevention education. Surveys conducted over this time period found a significant increase of the female sex workers reporting condom use during their last sex from 12 percent to 65 percent.\nThe use of digital technology is also further enabling reach of targeted groups. In partnership with the two main telecommunications companies in Tonga \u2013Digicel and Tonga CommunicationsCorporation \u2013 TFHA is putting out text messages containing sexual and reproductive health promotion information\u00a0four times a week to 5,000 UCALL mobile numbers around the country.\nClient intake forms at TFHA\u2019s three static clinics (on the main island of Tongatapu and the outer islands of Ha\u2019apai and Vava\u2019u) have shown that many people are learning about the services offered by TFHA through the text messages.\n\u201cOur static clinics have been fully accredited to provide VCCT services, including sexual and reproductive health and rights services,\u201d explains Katherine. \u201cSex workers prefer to access our services since TFHA provides a one-stop approach.\u201d\nTheir work empowering sex workers and strengthening their health and well-being is bringing real-world impact.\n\u201cThis is our fourth year of implementation, and it is interesting to note that now our sex worker clients are comfortable enough to bring their steady partner into the clinic with them,\u201d says Katherine, emphasizing the significance of this progress. \u201cThey bring them along and get tested as well. Contact tracing is very hard, it\u2019s been a challenge for service providers, so this is a really positive development.\u201d\n\u201cOne of our sex worker clients recently successfully completed her schooling, which is a success story of integration. We not only provided her with condoms, we also gave her a long-lasting contraceptive method, so that she can avoid unintended pregnancy, while also protecting herself from HIV and other STIs. That\u2019s quite a big impact. She was able to get her education.\u201d\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nA Malaria-Free Vanuatu, Contributing to the Good Health and Well-Being of the Population: 2022 Results at a Glance\nSupporting the Vanuatu Ministry of Health\u2019s vision to reduce local transmission of malaria to zero in all provinces and achieve a \u2018malaria-free Vanuatu\u2019 by the en...\n\nRead more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nMulti-Country Western Pacific Integrated HIV/TB Programme: 2022 Results at a Glance\nThe document highlights key and vulnerable populations reached with HIV/STI prevention and testing programmes.\n\nRead more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nMulti-Country Western Pacific Integrated HIV/TB Programme: Key Performance Indicators 2022\nThe Multi-Country Western Pacific Integrated HIV/TB Programme, supported by the Global Fund, continued to face challenges throughout 2022, primarily as a result o...\n\nRead more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\n\nNew boats for Vanuatu Ministry of Health will help extend reach of malaria response to remote communities\nSix new fiberglass boats have been delivered to the Vanuatu Ministry of Health by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), giving a boost to ongoing effor...\n\nRead more \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\nNauru's Strategic Response to COVID-19\nThe project is developed in line with Nauru's strategic response to the pandemic.
