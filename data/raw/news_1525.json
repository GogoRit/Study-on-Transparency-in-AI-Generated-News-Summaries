Wade, the legality of abortion was sent back to states \u2014 immediately reviving Wisconsin\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion ban. Few if any states reverted to laws as old as Wisconsin\u2019s. Over the nearly 50 years the ban was unenforceable, why had lawmakers never revoked it?\n\n\n\nStay informed on the latest news\nSign up for WPR\u2019s email newsletter.\n\nEmail\n\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the answer is simple: There was never the political will. And in the years immediately following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the political lines when it came to abortion were blurred. It would take nearly a decade for the major parties in Wisconsin, and the nation, to begin to adopt unified stances on abortion.And even as those stances coalesced, Democrats never amassed the legislative majorities they would need in Wisconsin to revoke the ban.\nJoanne Duren of Cazenovia, speaks after an Assembly vote on the bill she authored to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions on March 8, 1978. The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber.\u00a0Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images\nThe first significant post-Roe abortion legislation in Wisconsin was a bipartisan bill to restrict the procedure.Rep. Joanne Duren of Cazenovia was a Democrat, a devout Catholic and a passionate abortion opponent. She shepherded the 1978 proposal, which would prevent people from using Medicaid to pay for abortions, through months of legislative wrangling.\u201cThis will move the state from an economic policy of killing human life to a policy which favors child-bearing and childbirth,\u201d Duren told colleagues during one of the lengthy debates on the bill.Democrats held two-thirds supermajorities in both the Assembly and the Senate \u2014 but they were deeply divided on this issue. Nevertheless, Duren was optimistic the proposal would pass. Religious organizations and church leaders supported the plan, calling and writing lawmakers and showing up to testify at hearings. A sizable majority of lawmakers, it appeared, was ready to listen.Abortion rights activists hoping to stop the bill descended on Madison, shouting at lawmakers in the Assembly and Senate. They were ejected from the chambers as some threw pipe cleaners shaped like coathangers from the galleries, a reference to a crude instrument sometimes used for dangerous, self-induced abortions. \u201cYou\u2019re killing women,\u201d a protester shouted, according to newspaper coverage of the time.\nSen. Michele Radosevich was a freshman Democratic lawmaker when a bill to bar the use of Medicaid funds for abortion came before the Legislature. Radosevich said she was compelled to speak out against what she saw as a \u201ccruel\u201d bill. Her words landed her on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal on Feb. 17, 1978.\u00a0\u00a0Image courtesy Wisconsin State Journal\nDown on the floor, emotions among lawmakers also ran hot. One suggested government funded abortions would empower promiscuous women.The rhetoric rankled Michele Radosevich, then a freshman Democratic senator from North Hudson. She opposed the bill, which she described as \u201ccruel\u201d because it targeted poor women.\u201c\u2018Gentlemen, compassion, please,\u201d Radosevich said at the time. \u201cWhen you face your God, I wonder what you will tell him.\u201dThe debate lasted days. There were lengthy hearings and dozens of amendments. The bill pinged back and forth between houses before it was finally approved by the Legislature on March 8, 1978. After all that, Gov. Martin Schreiber, also a Democrat, vetoed the bill the same night.\u201cI know for sure that a pregnant woman is a human being \u2014 a person,\u201d he said when explaining his veto. \u201cI, in my own mind, do not know when a fetus becomes a human being \u2014 a person.\u201dThe infighting among Democrats did not end that night. They organized an attempt to override Schreiber\u2019s veto. And they came within two votes of succeeding. \nMartin J. Schreiber was the Democratic governor of Wisconsin from 1977-79. In this speech from 1978, he says,\u00a0\u201cI know for sure that a pregnant woman is a human being, a person. I, in my own mind, do not know when a fetus becomes a human being, a person. We are placing an unfair amount of weight imbalance to something which is unknown against that of a human being of which I can touch, of which I can relate to, of which I can have compassion for.\u201d Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images\nDemocrats would have restricted abortion further \u2014 if it weren\u2019t for pro-choice RepublicansAt this moment in time, the parties were split on abortion throughout the country, said Mary Ziegler, a leading expert on the history of abortion in the post-Roe v. Wade era.\u201cIn the \u201970s, the parties didn\u2019t have clear identities yet entirely when it came to abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that the Republican Party was the party of life, as Ronald Reagan put it, or the anti-abortion party, and the Democrats were supportive of legal abortion wouldn\u2019t really coalesce until the early \u201980s.\u201dThat divide played out in the 1978 debate on abortion. Rep. Sheehan Donoghue, a Republican, was instrumental in defeating the bill, not only voting to uphold Schreiber\u2019s veto but also delivering an impassioned speech that at least one lawmaker credited with changing his mind.\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d Donoghue told her colleagues, \u201cWhat you do here today, you will have to live with the rest of your lives.\u201dToday, Donoghue is retired, living in northern Wisconsin. She still remembers the debate and her reasons for opposing the bill.\u201cThis legislation, in my opinion, did damage to the equality of women in control over their own bodies,\u201d she said. She said she was particularly concerned the bill \u2014 while it included exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother \u2014 did not account for pregnancies that could harm the health of the mother. \u201cI found a real inconsistency there,\u201d she remembered. \u201cAnd I thought it was cruel towards women who happened to be on welfare, who had some problem, some physical problem, (if the pregnancy) would incapacitate them but not kill them.\u201dThe veto override failed by two votes, meaning Donoghue and other Republicans who opposed the bill were critical to its defeat.But it wasn\u2019t a clear-cut victory for abortion rights lawmakers. Days after Schreiber\u2019s veto, the Legislature passed a more limited bill that included protections for the health of a mother. Schreiber \u2014 who said he was \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d to abortion \u2014 signed it into law.\nAn abortion rights protester holds coat hangers outside the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wis., to protest a bill to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions, on March 8, 1978. The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber.\u00a0\u00a0Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images\nAs anti-abortion voters organize, the parties split The bipartisan coalitions that worked for and against the bill would be hard to imagine today, but Radosevich, the Democratic lawmaker who spoke so fervently on the floor, said they were common in the late \u201970s.\u201cIt was a very different time in terms of party alignment,\u201d she said.Still, Radosevich, a freshman lawmaker from a competitive district, knew the power of the abortion issue with voters. She had originally planned to stay quiet during debate and acknowledge that some of her Democratic colleagues were \u201cjust a little bit scared of the voters back home.\u201d Their silence, and the arguments from anti-abortion lawmakers, propelled her to speak up. That landed her on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal. She said she thinks that public stance, and the ensuing attention, contributed to her losing her next election.\u201cBut, you know, there\u2019s no way I could have voted for the bill and looked at myself in the mirror the next day,\u201d she said.On the other side of the abortion debate from Radosevich was Gary Goyke, then a Democratic state senator from Oshkosh. He voted in favor of the bill restricting Medicaid funds, telling WPR he viewed it, at the time, as the government removing itself from the abortion decision.But Goyke described it as a turning point for him, personally. He said he began to move more toward embracing abortion rights, including in his unsuccessful bid for Congress just a year later.That personal evolution wasn\u2019t without consequence. Goyke, a Catholic, remembers being confronted at church.\u201cA lady would come sit right in the front row. And at every service that I was at \u2014 every Mass I was at \u2014 she would stand up and say, \u2018Let us pray that Sen. Goyke learns to respect life,\u2019\u201d he remembered. \u201cAnd then the parish would say, \u2018Lord, hear our prayer.\u2019 And I am sitting right in front.\u201dIt was around this time when politically active anti-abortion voters were becoming a force in the Republican Party. But it didn\u2019t happen overnight.\nAbortion rights protesters gather outside the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wis., to protest a bill to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions, on March 8, 1978. The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber.\u00a0Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images\nWhen Barbara Lorman was first elected as a Republican state senator in 1980, she openly supported abortion access.\u201cI think I\u2019ve always been pro-choice,\u201d Lorman told WPR. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably also what led me to be a Republican.\u201dLorman said she always viewed her position on abortion as consistent with traditional Republican values, like minimizing government control over peoples\u2019 lives.  At the time, she says none of her Senate colleagues objected.\u201cYou know, almost anybody could fit in either party, frankly,\u201d Lorman said.But by 1994, it was a different story. After the 1990 Census, Republicans redrew her district, making it a lot more conservative \u2014 a safe seat for the GOP.She drew a primary challenge from Scott Fitzgerald \u2014 whom she describes as a \u201cdarling of the right wing\u201d \u2014 and says anti-abortion activists threw their weight behind him immediately.\u201cThose are very devoted, conscientious voters. And like overnight, yard signs went up and down the highway,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I saw that and I thought, \u2018Uh oh, this is gonna be a problem.\u2019\u201dFitzgerald won and went on to serve in the Senate for decades. He\u2019d later become the Senate\u2019s Majority Leader and now represents the area in Congress.The win was more than symbolic. In 1997, Fitzgerald was the lead sponsor of a law that banned \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d in Wisconsin, one of several incremental abortion restrictions championed by the anti-abortion movement in the decades since Roe.\nFormer Wisconsin State Senator Barbara Lorman at her home in Middleton on Tuesday, Aug. 8, 2023. Angela Major/WPR\nDemocrats undergo their own shift, but slowly  Democrats were undergoing their own shift toward abortion rights politics. In the 1990 race for attorney general, for example, the Republican incumbent signed on to a legal brief that supported overturning Roe v. Wade. His Democratic challenger, Jim Doyle, used it to campaign against him.\u201cThat was the number one issue,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got elected. So it really was \u2026 always a very important issue to me.\u201dDoyle later became governor and in 2009, Democrats won majorities in the Senate and Assembly. The party once again had complete control over state government for the first time in decades.Among the Democrats swept into office was Kelda Roys, a Madison state representative who, at 29, was the youngest member of the Legislature. Roys won a Democratic primary for her seat, in part, by touting her work as a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice, an abortion rights group.\u201cI came in just full of energy and optimism,\u201d Roys said. \u201cLike, \u2018Let\u2019s do all the things.\u2019\u201dOne of her most ambitious goals: To overturn the dormant pre-Civil War abortion ban she knew was still on the books.\nGov. Jim Doyle speaks to a joint session of the Wisconsin Legislature during his State of the State address Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2007, in Madison, Wis. Behind are Senate President Fred Risser, left, and Speak of the Assembly Mike Huebsch, right. Morry Gash/AP Photo\nThere were two problems, as Roys remembers. She said some abortion rights Democrats took Roe v. Wade for granted as settled law. And while Democrats held a slim overall majority, when it came to the issue of abortion, they didn\u2019t really have one at all. A handful of Democrats were still staunchly anti-abortion.\u201cIt seemed like something that was symbolic,\u201d she said of taking on the dormant law. \u201cAnd so there just wasn\u2019t necessarily the big appetite to do it. And we didn\u2019t have the votes in that particular session, because we had all these anti-choice folks in our caucus.\u201dBob Ziegelbauer was one of the Legislature\u2019s remaining anti-abortion Democrats. Now the Manitowoc County Executive, he says his stance on the issue was clear to everyone in the Democratic caucus. He doesn\u2019t remember ever being approached about working to lift the abortion ban.\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even think of asking me that, because it was so clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up, because they knew me and I knew them.\u201dThe cordial relationship came to an end during a debate on the 2009 state budget. Ziegelbauer supported a Republican amendment to restrict abortion, infuriating Democratic leadership. In response, they stripped him of a committee chairmanship. Later, Ziegelbauer left the party.\u201cThat was the only time I crossed that line. And that line is pretty bright,\u201d Ziegelbauer said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you doing that.\u201cThe 2009 session of the Legislature was defined by a difficult state budget and debates on issues ranging from payday loans to global warming to raw milk. Discussions of Wisconsin\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion ban never surfaced publicly.The ironic twist to Democrats\u2019 new fight The Democratic majority of 2009 was short-lived. In 2010, a Republican wave election gave the GOP control of the Legislature and brought Scott Walker into the governor\u2019s office. That Republican coalition was much more willing to use its power to effect abortion law. In just a few years, they passed laws ending state funding for Planned Parenthood, requiring patients seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound first and banning abortion after 20 weeks.Anti-abortion victories around the country culminated in 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. For the abortion rights Democratic Party, it was the worst case scenario \u2014 something advocates like Roys had warned could happen.Strictly politically speaking, however, that moment had a galvanizing effect for Wisconsin Democrats. Last fall, Democratic Gov.Tony Evers, who was viewed as vulnerable in his bid for reelection, ran hard on the issue of abortion \u2014 and won. \nKimberly resident Melissa Johnson holds a sign in support of Wisconsin state supreme court candidate Judge Janet Protasiewicz during a rally Saturday, March 11, 2023, in Appleton, Wis. Angela Major/WPR\nThis spring, Justice Janet Protasiewicz likewise placed abortion rights front and center in her campaign for state Supreme Court. That proved a winning strategy for her campaign, too. When Protasiewicz was sworn in earlier this month, liberals gained a majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years. That state Supreme Court could have the final say on any challenges to Wisconsin\u2019s abortion laws. If a pending lawsuit succeeds, the abortion ban could be gone.Today\u2019s Democratic Party is pushing hard for this. The state party poured millions of dollars into Protasiewicz\u2019s campaign, and earlier this year, every single Democratic member of the Legislature supported a proposal to overturn the state\u2019s abortion ban.If the ban is overturned, abortion would once again be legal in Wisconsin, but the laws that were passed in the years after Roe would also be restored.That means decades\u2019 worth of abortion restrictions would again be the law of the land \u2014 from the Medicaid restrictions passed in 1978, to the 20-week abortion ban signed by Walker in 2015.With the parties now firmly entrenched on this issue, the fight over abortion in post-Roe Wisconsin would go on.For more from \u201cHow We Got Here: Abortion in Wisconsin since 1849,\u201d visit wpr.org/1849.\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, \u00a9 Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule on constitutional right to abortion \n\n \n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans approve 14-week limit on abortion access \n\n \n\n\n\nOpponents and supporters of abortion access testify against 14-week ban \n\n \n\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris voices support for abortion access at Wisconsin visit \n\n \n\n\n\nIn victory for abortion rights, Dane County judge rules 19th century law does not ban abortions in Wisconsin \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Partner Navigation\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio Homepage\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducational Communications Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBS Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Site Navigation\n\nABOUT\n\nWho We Are\nEvents\nCareers / Volunteer\n\n\nLISTEN\n\nStations & Schedules\nMusic Playlists\nWays to Listen\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nWays to Give\nSupport FAQ\nFunding Information\n\n\nCONTACT\n\nGet in Touch\nHelp / FAQ\nNewsletters\n\n\nPOLICIES\n\nEthical Guidelines\nPolicies, Public Files and Reports\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u00a9 2024 by Wisconsin Public Radio, a service of the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and the University of Wisconsin-Madison\t\t\n\nSocial Networks Navigation\n\nFacebook \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
