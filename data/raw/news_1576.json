Dr. Eric Hazelrigg, the medical director of anti-abortion counseling centers in metro Phoenix, had asked the Arizona Supreme Court to review the decision. Anti-abortion centers, often known as \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d aim to dissuade people from getting an abortion.The 1864 law Hazelrigg wants the court to uphold imposes a near total ban on abortions, providing no exceptions for rape or incest and allowing abortions only if a mother\u2019s life is in danger.\n\nIn late December, the state Court of Appeals said it wasn\u2019t viewing the pre-statehood law in isolation of other statutes and concluded the state\u2019s laws make it clear only doctors are permitted to perform abortions. Non-doctors would still be subject to prosecution under the old law, the appeals court said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona lawmaker says she plans to have an abortion after learning her pregnancy isn\u2019t viable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden heads West to court Latino voters and secure his standing in Nevada and Arizona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court extends block on Texas law that would allow police to arrest migrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA court had blocked enforcement of the 1864 law shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court issued the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to an abortion. After the Supreme Court overturned the landmark decision in June, then-Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich succeeded in getting a state judge in Tucson to lift the court order blocking its enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
