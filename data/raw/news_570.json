Several people were detained by police after entering the premises.\nWomen\u2019s Strike posted on social media that among those detained was one of the group\u2019s leaders, Klementyna Suchanow.\nThe court verdict is supported by\u00a0Poland\u2019s right-wing and ultra-Catholic government, which gave it legal force by publishing it in the Journal of Laws on Wednesday.\nControversial ruling\nThe country was rocked by huge demonstrations when the verdict was first issued in October, following a request by members of the governing Law and Justice party (PiS).\nThe October 22 ruling said abortions in cases of foetal abnormalities were \u201cincompatible\u201d with the constitution.\nPredominantly Catholic Poland already has some of Europe\u2019s most restrictive laws on abortion.\n \n\n\n\n \nThere are fewer than 2,000 legal abortions every year and women\u2019s groups estimate that an additional 200,000 women have an abortion either illegally or abroad.\nThe government has defended the verdict, saying it will halt \u201ceugenic abortions\u201d, referring to the termination of foetuses diagnosed with Down\u2019s Syndrome, but human rights groups have said it will force women to carry non-viable pregnancies.\nMeanwhile, activists are reporting that Polish women with scheduled abortions are calling advice services in panic, as the new restrictions take effect.\n\u201cI picked up about 10 of these calls during the night, \u201d Krystyna Kacpura, director of Poland\u2019s Federation for Women and Family Planning (Federa) told the Reuters news agency.\n\u201cThey were (from women but) also from doctors and gynaecologists asking if this is in place, what should they do. \u2018The patient is ready for the procedure \u2013 should I send her home?'\u201d\nAbortions Without Borders, a support group helping women get abortions abroad, said it had received at least 30 calls from women by noon on Thursday.\nDolls and soft toys lie on the ground during a pro-choice demonstration in front of the constitutional court in Warsaw on Thursday night [Wojtek Radwanski/AFP]\nJustyna Wydrzynska, a member of the support team, told Reuters she expected to have at least 100 calls by the end of the day.\n\u201cYou are not alone, we are with you and we are doing all we can so that everyone who contacts us gets all the support they need as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\nPolish conservatives who supported the new limitations rejoiced as the ruling came into force on Thursday, arguing that they had finally secured equal human rights for unborn children and were shielding women from the trauma of abortion.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Polish saying that it\u2019s better to have 10 children on your arm than one on your conscience, and I think this is part of our philosophy to protect life,\u201d said Maria Kurowska, a member of parliament representing socially conservative grouping United Poland, allied with the ruling nationalists.\nSupporters of the ruling insisted that it is now up to the Polish government to provide additional support to families that have to care for disabled people and sick children.\nSource: Reutersaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
