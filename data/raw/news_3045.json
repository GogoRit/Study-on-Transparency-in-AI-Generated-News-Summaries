(CCN photo)\n\n\n\n\n\nNewly released data from the Angus Reid Institute indicates roughly 52 per cent of Canadians are \u201ccompletely pro-choice,\u201d around eight per cent are \u201ccompletely pro-life.\u201d and approximately 41 per cent consider themselves \u201csomewhere in between.\u201d\nThose numbers are quite startling to Dr. Moira McQueen, director of the Canadian Catholic Bioethics Institute.\n\u201cThe people who say they are completely pro-choice \u2013 52 per cent according to the headline \u2013 have a view that an abortion should be available at any time during a pregnancy. That is actually pretty startling in its clarity,\u201d said McQueen.\nDave Korzinski, a research director for the Angus Reid Institute, said the randomized survey of 1,805 adults was executed to uncover if there were shades of grey about this complex issue that are not always captured in the public square.\u00a0\n\u201cBuilding on that, we asked the question about how important your faith is to you,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those who feel most strongly faithful, there are a lot of people there who are in the middle on this issue. Forty per cent (of those who say faith is important to them) say they are completely pro-life, but almost equally likely at 39 per cent are people who say they understand the need for the procedure at certain points of pregnancy.\u201d\nOf the 1,805 total participants, 199 answered \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to the statement \u201cmy faith is important to me\u201d and 383 \u201cagree.\u201d\nWith 21 per cent of the people who strongly agree faith is important to them labelling themselves as completely pro-choice, for Catholics in particular the viewpoint contradicts the tenets of the faith, said McQueen.\n\u201cJust about every Catholic knows that the Church is against abortion and euthanasia. But there is still this large group of Catholics that must be indifferent to the teaching or absolutely disagree with the teaching. Or they don\u2019t really understand the importance of the dignity of the human being from conception.\u201d\nMcQueen offered some reasons behind the disconnect.\u00a0\n\u201cThe way we view human life at that level is very technical, clinical or, worst of all, utilitarian,\u201d said McQueen. \u201cWe think we can do something to that life to benefit ourselves for research and experimentation \u2013 and a lot of people think that is perfectly valid because it can help with medical research.\u201d\nOf the 199 people who say faith is very important to them, 56 per cent believe the \u201cviable fetus has equal rights to the woman who is pregnant.\u201d Twenty-three per cent say \u201cthe viable fetus does not have equal rights, only the woman who is pregnant has rights.\u201d About 22 per cent are not sure.\u00a0\nThe percentages fluctuate significantly when the 383 people whose faith is important to them were asked this question. Just 31 per cent say the fetus and woman is equal, 42 per cent affirm only the woman has rights and 27 per cent are unsure.\u00a0\nAngus Reid also examined how Canadians view abortion through a political lens in the wake of the Roe v. Wade overturn in the United States in the summer. The data indicated 57 per cent of polled Canadians want more legislation introduced to improve access to abortion, 34 per cent are satisfied with the status quo and nine per cent want policies that restrict abortion access.\nThere is essentially a 50/50 split between people who believe it is acceptable or unacceptable for the Liberal and NDP parties to ban pro-life candidates from running for office. The percentages are also close when considering if the government should revoke charitable status for pro-life organizations. About 38 per cent approve, 35 disapprove and 26 are undecided.\u00a0\nScott Hayward, co-founder of RightNow, an advocacy organization that champions pro-life political candidates, said these near-even splits are both encouraging and troubling.\n\u201cI suppose it is encouraging that half of the Canadian population is with us pro-lifers on basic policy questions and the ability for us to advocate for pre-born children in the body politic and legislatures across the country; the troubling thing would be that, according to this poll, half of the country is opposed to us participating in elected politics,\u201d said Hayward.\u00a0\n\u201cRegardless, RightNow will continue to elect pro-life politicians to build toward pro-life majorities in our legislatures so that pro-life legislation is passed to reduce the abortion and assisted suicide rates.\u201d\nThe data can be found at angusreid.org.\u00a0\nCanadian Catholic News\nSend us a letter to the editor about this or any other article.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\nPopular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\nLand grabs to armed conflicts: Share Lent tackling challenges faced by farmers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoices\nWhy fast when we have important work to do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\nIn a time of isolation, teachers are helping their students build resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\n\u2018I\u2019ve only known of Catholicism through the culture\u2019: new Catholics share their journey to the Church\n\n\n\n\n\nMore of the latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\nHow an \u2018attractive appointment\u2019 in Canada turned into an \u2018intimidating assignment\u2019 for Apostolic Nuncio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\nRabbi offers thanks to two friends of Vancouver Jewish community: the Archdiocese and the VPD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\nCome off the sidelines, Archbishop invites Our Lady of Sorrows parishioners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Vancouver\n\u2018I\u2019ve only known of Catholicism through the culture\u2019: new Catholics share their journey to the Church\n\n\n\n\n\nView more popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share\n Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand grabs to armed conflicts: Share Lent tackling challenges faced by farmers\nWith the plight of farmers making headlines around the world, Share Lent\u2019s focus this year on small-scale farming and...\n \nCatholic Vancouver\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Dead people don\u2019t cost money\u2019: Calculating the cost of ending 2,700 lives with MAiD\nThe grim calculus of tracking the cost of Medical Assistance in Dying shows that B.C. doctors receive $283.85 for every \u201cMAiD...\n \nCatholic Vancouver\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA timeline of Pope Francis\u2019 11 years as Pope\nMarch 13 marks the anniversary of the election of Pope Francis as the 266th successor of St. Peter.
