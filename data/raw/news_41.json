Reuters\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulie Burkhart, founder of an abortion clinic in conservative Oklahoma, is not new to the violence that can lie behind\u00a0the vitriol of the abortion debate in America.\u00a0\nShe established her organisation, Trust Women, just\u00a0six weeks after the murder of her former mentor and boss, Dr George Tiller, at the hands of an anti-abortion zealot 11 years ago.\nBut with several US states using the coronavirus pandemic to attempt bans on abortion procedures, Ms Burkhart says the current climate has reached \"a higher level of intensity\" than anything she has witnessed before. \u00a0\nHer Oklahoma City abortion clinic is one of dozens that have been forced to turn away hundreds of patients after officials included abortions in their bans on non-essential medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"We have had women call who are frantic,\" she said. \"They're angry. They're upset. People don't understand why abortion would be excluded as an essential healthcare need at this time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJulie Burkhart says the current climate has reached \"fever pitch\"\n\t\t\t\n\nCredit: Charlie Riedel\u00a0/AP\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nShe recalled one patient who was nearing the legal limit for terminations and had no access to transportation.\nThe clinic rushed to buy the woman a bus ticket to travel to Ms Burkhart's other clinic in Wichita, Kansas along with a mask and gloves to limit the risks of taking public transportation.\nAnother woman had required special permission to travel from a detention centre in northern Arkansas to the clinic in Oklahoma City, only to find the state had shut services down that very day.\n\"She had to go back and get permission to travel to Wichita,\" said Ms Burkhart. \"That was burdensome for her... it's quite a drive\".\nThese accounts are not unique. Several providers The Telegraph spoke with described how patients had been forced to drive hundreds of miles to find treatment in neighbouring states.\nOthers feared patients would turn to DIY-methods after they disclosed they had been researching options online.\nThis week a judge put a temporary restraining order in place to allow abortions to continue in Oklahoma. A judge in Alabama on Monday also ruled that the state cannot use the pandemic as justification for stopping abortions.\u00a0\nBut in Texas, the Court of Appeal has allowed governor Greg Abbott's ban on all abortion services to remain in place.\n\n\n\n\nTexas abortion ban\n\n\n\nAmong those affected by the ban was a 24-year-old student in Arlington, Texas who lost her part-time waitressing job three weeks ago, when her restaurant was forced to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.\nShe discovered she was pregnant the same week. She outlined her story in a lawsuit filed by a coalition of pro-choice organisations against Mr Abbott.\nThe woman, named only as \"Jane Doe\", described how the night before she was due to receive an abortion pill at a clinic in Fort Worth, she got a call from the clinic.\n\"The staffer told me that Gov. Greg Abbott halted all abortions in the state, claiming that medical supplies needed to be saved for other patients,\" she said.\n\"I started to cry, and she cried too. She told me my only option at that point was to go out of state or delay my abortion and possibly be forced to have a baby. I was dumbfounded. I had a plan and everything came crashing down.\"\nThe woman said she frantically began calling clinics in other states, and eventually managed to get an appointment in Denver, Colorado - 780 miles away.\nShe made the 12 hour drive to Denver, where she was given two abortion pills. She took the first one in the clinic; the second she was instructed to take at home 24 hours later.\n\"It felt like we were in a race against time... We didn\u2019t want to take breaks or rest because I was worried about having my abortion in the car.\"\n\"Obviously, had this pregnancy not been a factor, I wouldn\u2019t be travelling during a pandemic,\" she added in the lawsuit. \"Instead, I was forced to drive across the country, to stop at dirty gas stations, to stay in an unfamiliar home, just to get health care. I feel like Texas put me in danger.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPro-life activists pray outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin, Texas\n\t\t\t\n\nCredit: Christian Science Monitor\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nMr Abbott has argued he is responding to the fact that hospital capacity and personal protective equipment \"are being depleted by surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary\". But critics accuse him of cynically using the coronavirus pandemic to enforce his own political views.\nNancy Northrup, the CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is backing the Texas lawsuit, said: \"It's important to realise in the context of this that all of the states that are doing this are states that have taken huge measures to try and block abortion in any event\".\n\"The level of aggression and the volume of anti-abortion rights laws that are passing is I'd say the most intense that it has been since Roe v Wade,\" she added, referencing the 1973 Supreme Court case which made abortion a constitutional right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDr. George Tiller was shot and killed while in church in 2009\n\t\t\t\n\nCredit: Dave Williams\u00a0/AP\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nMs Burkhart put it another way. She had worked through what was called the \"Summer of Mercy\", the infamous six-week period in 1991 when thousands of pro-life activists blockaded abortion clinics in Kansas. Then came the \"horrific\" 2009 assassination of her boss, Dr Tiller, a prominent abortion doctor who had become a focal point for the anti-abortion movement. \u00a0\n\"But this is just fever pitch and people are just scared to death\" she said. \"Because we actually have government officials in a variety of states actively banning abortion.\"\n\"They're taking the opportunity with this pandemic to wield their anti-choice political axe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbortion\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment speech bubble icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense this content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nMore stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe huge, resource rich territory China will snatch while the West dithers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Hunt hints at general election date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutin\u2019s 450-mile railway to Crimea \u2018will soon be operational\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince of Wales\u2019s public nod to Kate with \u2018wish she was here\u2019 comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacron\u2019s former health minister cashing in on penis enlargements, claim critics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump hints at deporting Prince Harry over claims he lied on visa application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from The Telegraph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\nFacebook icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp Centre\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nTelegraph Extra\n\n\nReader Prints\n\n\nBranded Content\n\n\nSyndication and Commissioning\n\n\nFantasy Sport\n\n\nUK Voucher Codes\n\n\nBetting Offers\n\n\nTax Strategy\n\n\nBroadband and Mobile Deals\n\n\nThe Chelsea Magazine Company\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\nDownload the Telegraph App\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\nModern Slavery\n\n\nAdvertising terms\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
