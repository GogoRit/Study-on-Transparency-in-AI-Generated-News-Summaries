Pavone then transferred to another diocese, which was not named in reports.\nThe intervention of the bishop to halt his broadcasts was the latest of a number of clashes with members of the U.S. hierarchy over 20 years.\nOn his website, Pavone wrote: \u201cWe all expect that the pro-abortion groups, like Planned Parenthood, will target, harass and try to intimidate us. And they do try.\n\u201cBut when such treatment comes from bishops and other Church authorities \u2014 which it increasingly does \u2014 it\u2019s particularly deplorable,\u201d he added.\n\u201cInstead of supporting and encouraging the pro-life work of the Church, some of these men try to obstruct and hinder it, and abuse their authority to try to intimidate priests and laity who make ending abortion the top priority of our lives.\u201d\nBesides his leadership of Priests for Life, Pavone has also been an avid and active supporter of former U.S. President Trump, serving as an advisory board member of a group called Catholics for Trump, possibly in contravention of The Code of Canon Law which forbids priests from active roles in political parties.\nIn November 2016, Pavone filmed a video in support for Mr Trump\u2019s presidential campaign featuring the body of an aborted baby laid on what appeared to be an altar, which infuriated some Catholic bishops.\nPavone answered their criticism by saying that the baby was laid \u201con a table in our office, not a consecrated altar in a chapel\u201d.\n\u201cThat table, sometimes used for Mass, was also the place where all my videos in this educational series of election broadcasts were made,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have made the baby video in a different location so as to avoid any confusion to begin with.\u201d\nPavone later stepped down from the two positions with Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in 2020 at the request of American bishops.\n This page is available to subscribers.
