Little responds to Biden lawsuit against Idaho\u2019s pro-life law \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Little responds to Biden lawsuit against Idaho\u2019s pro-life lawTuesday August 2, 2022Boise, Idaho \u2013 Governor Brad Little issued the following statement today after President Joe Biden\u2019s U.S. Justice Department announced it filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho\u2019s pro-life law.\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s highest court returned the issue of abortion to the states to regulate \u2013 end of story. The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s interference with Idaho\u2019s pro-life law is another example of Biden overreaching yet again while he continues to ignore issues that really should demand his attention \u2013 like crushing inflation and the open border with Mexico. \n\u201cHere in Idaho, we are proud that we have led the country in protecting preborn lives. I will continue to work with Attorney General Lawrence Wasden to vigorously uphold state sovereignty and defend Idaho\u2019s laws in the face of federal meddling,\u201d Governor Little said.\n# # #\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Governor State Capitol\nPO Box 83720\nBoise, ID 83720\nPhone: (208) 334-2100\nFax: (208) 854-3036\n\n \n\nFacebook IconTwitter IconInstagram IconYouTube IconEnvelope Icon Sign up for News\nFlag Status\n\n\n\n\nIdaho.gov |\n                Accessibility |\n                Cybersecurity |\n                Privacy |\n                Legal\n                    Notices |\n                Security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nver: 3.5.2a | last updated: August 2, 2022 at 01:59 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump back to top of page button \n\n\n"
