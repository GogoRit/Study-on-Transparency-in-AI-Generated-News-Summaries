The bottom line here is that decisions about pregnancy are deeply personal, and those decisions belong to Nebraskans \u2014 not politicians. We are committed to doing all we can to protect legal access to abortion in Nebraska, and we know that thousands of Nebraskans are with us. Now is the time to show up and speak out.\u201d\u00a0\nThe ban was first announced at a press event last week, along with\u00a0LB 606, a bill that would financially incentivize donations to so-called \u201cpregnancy help organizations,\u201d\u00a0also sometimes called\u00a0\u201ccrisis pregnancy centers.\u201d\u00a0These facilities were the subject of a critical\u00a02022 ACLU of Nebraska report\u00a0that raised concerns about patients receiving misinformation.\nState Senators Albrecht, Aguilar, Ballard, Bostelman, Brewer, Briese, Clements, DeKay, Dorn, Dover, Erdman, Geist, Halloran, Hardin, Holdcroft, Hughes, Ibach, Jacobson, Kauth, Linehan, Lippincott, Lowe, McDonnell, Moser, Murman, Riepe, Sanders, Slama, and von Gillern cosponsored LB 626.\u00a0\nThe legislation comes just weeks after\u00a0the release of new polling\u00a0showing that most Nebraskans oppose state senators enacting more abortion bans.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay informed\nEmail address *\n\n\n\nZip code *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeople Power \nView Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related content    \nTake Action to Protect Abortion Access in NebraskaJune 9, 2022\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch aclunebraska.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Assistance\nPress\nCareers\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 ACLU of Nebraska\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
