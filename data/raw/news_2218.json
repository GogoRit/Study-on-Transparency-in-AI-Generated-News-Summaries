Wade became law of the land,\u201d Marten told host Abby Johnson, noting that there was an almost instant reaction to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case. \u201cYou just saw this tenacity inside these men and women who said, \u2018We\u2019re not OK with this ... we can actually step up and provide another alternative.\u2019\u201dListen to Marten break down the myths surrounding crisis pregnancy centers, and the developments unfolding inside these institutions:So it was this sincere effort to provide women with another option that sparked crisis and pregnancy care centers \u2014 organizations that continue to grow and evolve decades later.Marten heralded the fact that today\u2019s pregnancy centers are truly \u201ccommunity-based\u201d and grassroots, meaning that each center is connected to a local community.\u201cBy us being grassroots, it actually allows us to be very specific to the demographic,\u201d she explained.One critique often given by pro-choice advocates is that crisis pregnancy centers do not provide needed medical services and instead offer a more restrictive focus on counseling women and offering emotional and physical support.But Marten said there has been a major growth in the number of medical pregnancy centers in the U.S., with an \u201cexplosion of medical services\u201d being offered in centers around the country.She noted that the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a pro-life research group, has also detailed a major increase in the number of medical professionals working inside of pregnancy care centers.\u201cIn 2019, there were 3,791 medical professions who were employed at crisis pregnancy centers and thousands more who volunteer,\u201d she said.LISTEN: Subscribe and Hear Every Episode of Abby Johnson\u2019s 'Politely Rude'Marten stressed the importance of education in addressing abortion and the issues that surround it, noting that many women who seek abortion often believe it\u2019s their only option.\u201cThere was \u2026 research done in 2018 and it said 49% of women who had abortions \u2026 did so, not because they believed abortion was their best option \u2014 they did so because they thought it was their only option,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people this is affecting don\u2019t feel like they have a choice.\u201dBut when pregnancy resource centers step in and offer options and help for housing, jobs and other needs, things start to change.\u201cWhen we start to lay out that path for them, then they don\u2019t want abortion,\u201d Marten said.Listen to other powerful episodes of \u201cPolitely Rude\u201d with host Abby Johnson on Edifi:Was this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
