The one with fenders flaring out on both sides.\u00a0More:J.D. Vance\u2019s 'disdain' for Ukraine proof he's wrong for Ohioans and Donald Trump| OpinionWith twin exhausts blowing hot air that pollutes the environment we live in.A car still loud from the roar of its engine with lots of cubic inches.\u00a0Not to mention screeching tires when going from 0-60 in single digits.With an exterior painted a garish color and an interior featuring an\u00a0electroluminescent\u00a0steering wheel.\u00a0Shiny objects providing bragging rights.Even though the Republicans were in reverse gear and going backwards.

But a conception does not create a baby. It creates only a body.It does not create a life, because life pre-exists and post-exists all earthly bodies. (And if your spirituality doesn\u2019t include this statement, then why do you care about abortion anyway?)More:Letters: I remember 'horror stories of girls who died in desperate circumstances' before RoeWe are all pro-life.
