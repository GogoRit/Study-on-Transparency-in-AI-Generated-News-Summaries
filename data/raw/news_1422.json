And the pro-life issue\u2019s the most important,\u201d he said. \n\nByChris Potter/WESASeptember 28, 2022\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano speaks at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been three months since the United States Supreme Court handed down its ruling deeming that Americans no longer have a Constitutional right to abortion. But even Republicans who celebrated the decision have tried out varying approaches to the issue, as polls show the ruling could galvanize Democratic-leaning voters this fall.\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Doug Mastriano, a staunch foe of abortion rights, is a case in point. In the weeks after the ruling, he referred to the issue as \u201ca distraction\u201d\u00a0that Democrats would prefer to talk about rather than matters like inflation. He also suggested that since voters decide elections,\u00a0what a governor thought about the topic was of little importance.\nThat was a marked change from Mastriano\u2019s previous pronouncements on the issue, which included\u00a0an assertion during a Republican primary debate\u00a0that abortion was \u201cthe number-one issue\u201d and that he favored a total ban on the practice. And in recent days, he seems to have abandoned that warier approach to the issue.\nAt a demonstration opposed to abortion rights, Mastriano told\u00a0a local TV reporter that abortion\u00a0was \u201cthe single most important issue of our lifetime.\u201d He also made the case explicit during a Thursday-night call with abortion-rights foes hosted by the Pro-Life Coalition of Pennsylvania.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHYY thanks our sponsors \u2014 become a WHYY sponsor\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of our issues are important. And the pro-life issue\u2019s the most important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can fulfill and achieve most of our desires in protecting life when we win on eight November.\u201d\nMastriano repeated that abortion would be decided by the people, adding that \u201cthis is your chance to change history.\u201d But he made clear that the stakes for abortion rights in his own election were high.\nHe pointed out that earlier efforts to restrict abortion \u2014 like a so-called \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d that would bar the procedure after 6-weeks \u2014 had been unable to surmount a veto. But if elected, he said, \u201cI look forward to signing into law either [a] heartbeat bill or the fetal pain bill\u201d which would also limit abortion access based on contested assertions about whether a fetus feels pain.\nMastriano also sought to argue that his Democratic rival, Josh Shapiro, was \u201can extreme radical [who] wants to have abortion through birth.\u201d\n        \n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics & Policy \n\n            What you need to know ahead of the 2022 Pa. general election                       \n\nPennsylvania\u2019s general election is Tuesday, Nov. 8. Here\u2019s what you should know beforehand, from election deadlines to who\u2019s on the ballot.\n\n1 year ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapiro has long said that he supported the current Pennsylvania law, which permits abortion up to 24 weeks, and afterward only in cases where it poses a threat to the life or health of the mother. \u201cMy job as governor will be to protect Pennsylvania law,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN in May.\nMastriano also noted that when Shapiro was a member of the state House, he was on the losing side of votes to impose new regulations on abortion providers \u2014 legislation drafted after a Philadelphia doctor, Kermit Gosnell, was caught preforming illegal and botched abortions. Shapiro was among the Democrats who opposed the measures, after warning that the rules \u201cwill have the effect of shutting down a woman\u2019s access to her right.\u201d (A handful did close after the law went into effect.) Shapiro also sought to have a panel of medical experts weigh in on any proposed changes.\nBut the effort to portray Democrats as the abortion extremists \u2014 even as many seek only to maintain the status quo \u2014 is widespread. When\u00a0national Republicans came to the Monongahela Valley to roll out their \u201cCommitment to America\u201d\u00a0last week, few wanted to discuss the GOP agenda\u2019s pledge to \u201cprotect the lives of unborn children.\u201d\nDemocrats \u201cused to say abortion should be rare,\u201d House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters, while repeatedly declining to answer questions about whether Republicans would seek to restrict abortion rights nationwide. \u201cToday they say abortion should be mandated, legal, all the way up until a baby\u2019s born alive.\u201d\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHYY thanks our sponsors \u2014 become a WHYY sponsor\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocrats in the House continue to push the idea that we should be able to pull someone from their mother\u2019s womb until the date of birth,\u201d said Pennsylvania Congressman Lloyd Smucker, who hedged when asked what action Republicans might take on abortion rights at the federal level.\nFact-checkers have dismissed such characterizations of Democrats\u2019 positions, calling them \u201cdisingenuous at best,\u201d and noting that abortions late in a pregnancy are vanishingly rare and driven by catastrophic health concerns. But even as Republicans make anti-abortion pledges to their base, they maintain that the issue is of little interest.\n\u201cThe only people that are asking about this are the press,\u201d said western Pennsylvania Rep. Guy Reschenthaler when asked what the GOP pledge could mean in the next Congress. He said the Republican agenda was focused on issues like \u201ceconomics, on public safety and fighting crime, making sure that, for example, women and only women can participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d\nWhether he\u2019s right about that may become more clear November 8.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the WHYY app!\n\nStream WHYY-FM, read the top stories from WHYY News, and listen to the latest podcast from WHYY Digital Studios \u2014 anytime, anywhere.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nShare thisFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nWHYY is your source for fact-based, in-depth journalism and information.
