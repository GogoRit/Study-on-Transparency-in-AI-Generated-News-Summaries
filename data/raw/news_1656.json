You can have those conversations in email. But to do it in committee to try to intimidate this committee to go a certain direction is uncalled for,\u201d Sexton said.\nBrewer had given the subcommittee mixed signals, saying Tennessee Right to Life supports leaving the state\u2019s abortion ban alone but that he could agree to some changes that would enable physicians to make objective decisions in saving the life of women suffering from dangerous pregnancies.\n  Will Brewer, legal counsel and lobbyist for Tennessee Right to Life\nYet, he also said the bill is not considered \u201cpro-life\u201d and that Tennessee Right to Life PAC would be giving a negative score to those who support it.\nRep. Esther Helton-Haynes, R-East Ridge, the bill\u2019s sponsor, told the committee she considers the legislation a \u201ctruly pro-life bill.\u201d\n\u201cThese moms want their babies. They\u2019re not looking for an abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething goes terribly wrong in their pregnancy, and I feel physicians shouldn\u2019t have to hesitate when they know what needs to be done to take care of these mothers.\u201d\nThe Legislature passed the \u201ctrigger\u201d bill in 2019, enabling it to take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, setting up one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. It was effective in August 2022, and almost immediately lawmakers started reversing course on the ban, saying an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d provision in the law endangered doctors professionally and put them in the position of being charged with a felony for performing an abortion in an effort to save women suffering through dangerous pregnancies. Under the law, physicians have to prove in court they took action to prevent a woman from dying or suffering from a debilitating illness.\nThe Tennessee Medical Association supported the legislation Tuesday because it requires proof to be shown that a physician performed an illegal abortion before the doctor can be prosecuted.\n\u201cOnce a physician is charged with a crime, that physician is subject to immediate penalties such as loss of hospital privileges, being kicked out of health insurance networks, losing jobs, having their face splayed across the hometown newspaper,\u201d said Yarnell Beatty, attorney for the Tennessee Medical Association.\u00a0\nBrewer, however, contended that doctors shouldn\u2019t be able to make their own decisions about ending pregnancies without going through a series of steps, including sending women home in hopes that problem pregnancies would \u201cwork themselves out.\u201d His statement brought near jeers from the audience in the meeting room.\nAnd some lawmakers told him even though they respect his organization they couldn\u2019t believe he would want to put women\u2019s lives at risk to save a doomed pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese moms want their babies.
