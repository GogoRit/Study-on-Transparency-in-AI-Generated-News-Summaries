    "description": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a bill to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, giving the Republican a major conservative policy victory as he prepares to launch an expected presidential candidacy. DeSantis signed the measure late Thursday night in a private ceremony without fanfare, hours after the Republican-dominated statehouse approved the bill. The law will take effect only if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court. For DeSantis, the closed door bill signing signals the difficult political line he is walking on abortion politics ahead of his anticipated White House run",

(AP) \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a bill to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, giving the Republican a major conservative policy victory as he prepares to launch an expected presidential candidacy.DeSantis signed the measure late Thursday night in a private ceremony without fanfare, hours after the Republican-dominated statehouse approved the bill.The law will take effect only if the state\u2019s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives.For DeSantis, the late night, closed door bill signing was a departure from his usual bombastic style and signals the difficult political line he is walking on abortion politics ahead of his anticipated White House run. Restrictions, popular among some conservative GOP primary voters, are seen as potentially damaging among the broader electorate and have led to bruising losses at the ballot box for Republicans in recent months.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to support life and family in the state of Florida. I applaud the Legislature for passing the Heartbeat Protection Act that expands pro-life protections and provides additional resources for young mothers and families,\u201d DeSantis said in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    READ MORE\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives: withdrawing signatures from petitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast \u2018immoral\u2019 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA six-week ban would diminish the Florida\u2019s status as destination for the procedure in a region that has severely tightened access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, while Georgia forbids the procedure after cardiac activity can be detected, which is around six weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis ban would prevent four million Florida women of reproductive age from accessing abortion care after six weeks \u2014 before many women even know they\u2019re pregnant,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement issued after the bill passed the Legislature. \u201cThis ban would also impact the nearly 15 million women of reproductive age who live in abortion-banning states throughout the South, many of whom have previously relied on travel to Florida as an option to access care.\u201d\n\nThe law contains some exceptions, including to save the woman\u2019s life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation such as a restraining order or police report. DeSantis has called the rape and incest provisions sensible.Drugs used in medication-induced abortions \u2014 which make up the majority of those provided nationally \u2014 could be dispensed only in person or by a physician under the Florida law. Separately, nationwide access to the abortion pill mifepristone is being challenged in court.https://apnews.com/video/business-strikes-greta-gerwig-national-79366a4c9b334b30a34304397f93d423DeSantis, who has rocketed to Republican stardom through his focus on divisive cultural issues, had been uncharacteristically tepid in his support for the six-week ban, typically only saying, \u201cWe welcome pro-life legislation,\u201d when asked about the measure. Last year, DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban in a large public ceremony at an evangelical church.\n\nThe governor is expected to announce his presidential candidacy after the session ends in May, with his potential White House run in part buoyed by the conservative policies approved by the Republican supermajority in the statehouse this year.\u201cDeSantis signed the extremist 6-week abortion ban into law just before 12 am, hoping Floridians won\u2019t notice he stripped away a right most people agree with,\u201d House Democratic Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said on Twitter. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want FL\u2019s present to become America\u2019s future, we must stop him in \u201924.\u201dAbortion bans are popular among some religious conservatives who are part of the GOP voting base, but the issue has motivated many others to vote for Democrats. Republicans have recently lost in elections centered on abortion access in states such as Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin.\u201cRon DeSantis, continues to put his political ambitions over the rights and well being of Floridians. He\u2019s not looking out for their best interests \u2014 he\u2019s thinking only of himself and his future presidential campaign. Make no mistake: this dangerous decision will backfire and harm the very people he is supposed to protect,\u201d Jenny Lawson, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
