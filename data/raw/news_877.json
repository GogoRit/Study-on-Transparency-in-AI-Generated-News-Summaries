Imagine you work a job that pays the bills, but you don\u2019t have as much time off as you\u2019d like, and working from home isn\u2019t an option. When you find out you\u2019re pregnant, you decide\u2014for any number of valid reasons\u2014that you want to terminate that pregnancy.\u00a0\nFor many people, that just got easier. Until recently, the FDA mandated in-person visits before patients could receive mifepristone, a hormone blocker used in medication abortion\u2014a non-invasive alternative to surgical abortions that\u2019s growing more and more popular. The restriction was first lifted temporarily, as one of the agency\u2019s pandemic measures; it\u2019s now permanent, which signifies a major expansion of access to abortion by mail.\nYou may already know all that. But you may also live in Texas, Georgia, or Mississippi, states with draconian abortion laws\u2014and just three of the 19 where telemedicine for abortion is outlawed. The nearest clinic might be at capacity, or out of state altogether, and you can\u2019t afford the costs of travel.\u00a0\nSo you try the next quickest option: googling \u201chow to buy abortion pills.\u201d You might encounter a site like AidAccess, launched by Dutch doctor Rebecca Gomperts, who conducts telemedicine appointments and arranges shipments of mifepristone and misoprostol, another drug used in medication abortion, from abroad.\u00a0\nAs you search, your phone and computer log your every move: the search history stored on your Google Chrome browser, your internet service provider\u2019s record of incoming and outgoing requests, the financial details tracked by your payment processor, the emails you send, and more.\u00a0\nYou might not think much about your digital footprint\u2014after all, your searches are private, right?\u00a0\nNot really. As the line between our digital and physical selves fades, surveillance researchers and reproductive rights advocates increasingly see our data as the next big front in the war on abortion. Law enforcement has new tricks to land convictions for miscarriages or post-ban abortions; anti-abortion activists are making sophisticated updates to tried-and-true methods of stalking, harassment, and disinformation.\nUntil the FDA loosened its rules, getting a medication abortion in some parts of the country meant flouting the law\u2014and leaving an incriminating digital trail. Gomperts, who also provides surgical abortions in international waters, has had her boat tracked and chased away from ports of call, and payments to her organization blocked. Ursula Wing\u2019s online sales of low-cost mifepristone earned her a $10,000 fine, a raid of her home, two years\u2019 probation, and the seizure of all her electronics; she thinks being listed in an online database contributed to her getting caught. (The online sale of mifepristone was legalized a year into her sentence.)\nSurveillance doesn\u2019t just show up in cases like those. Search histories mentioning abortion medication have been entered as evidence in fetal death cases prosecuted as crimes\u2014a scenario that, like targeted harassment by anti-choice protestors, crops up much more often. Today, law enforcement has more data-extraction tools at its disposal than ever, and privacy regulations still trail behind.\nCivil rights attorney Cynthia Conti-Cook, a technology fellow at the Ford Foundation, researches the use of digital footprints as evidence in prosecutions for fetal death or improper disposal of fetal remains. Law enforcement, she says, drawing on tech justice group UpTurn\u2019s study of \u201cmobile device forensic tools,\u201d can easily duplicate all data on a user\u2019s phone into one convenient, searchable, thousands-of-pages-long file.\nSuch tools, Conti-Cook says, aren\u2019t \u201cfuturistic or speculative at all,\u201d and have few limits on the scope of their use. In fact, more than 2,000 government agencies\u2014from police departments and prisons to public schools and housing authorities\u2014use them to extract and share data in investigations of all kinds. In an analysis of public records, UpTurn found that just 44 law enforcement agencies extracted data from 50,000 phones between 2015 and 2019, using their findings in prosecutions for sex work, public drinking, shoplifting, cannabis possession, and more.\nNews coverage of digital forensics often celebrates its role in prosecuting serious felonies. But when it comes to reproductive rights, Conti-Cook says, the same tools \u201cwill be a powerful [asset] to police and prosecutors in a more criminalized landscape\u201d for abortion seekers.\nConti-Cook\u2019s research examines the cases of pregnant women whose personal data helped secure their convictions. In 2017, Latice Fisher, a Black woman, arrived at a Mississippi hospital after losing a pregnancy at home. Because she had admitted during an earlier gynecological exam that she was pregnant, but never returned for an ultrasound, suspicious medical officials handed her medical records to police, who launched an investigation. Since Fisher had voluntarily surrendered her phone, prosecutors were able to scrape her search history, which included searches for misoprostol, and used it as evidence that she had intentionally \u201ckilled\u201d her fetus. She was charged with second-degree murder.\u00a0\nConti-Cook argues that Fisher\u2019s case isn\u2019t an anomaly but a \u201csobering forecast\u201d of what\u2019s to come. \u201cLarge carve-outs and exceptions\u201d give law enforcement wide latitude to utilize \u201cmass extraction tools,\u201d she says, which will \u201cinevitably expose everyone\u2014not just pregnant people\u2014to this sort of digital self-incrimination.\u201d Even in the realm of reproductive rights, it\u2019s not just abortion at stake: Conti-Cook says she\u2019s recently heard from home-birth advocates worried about similar surveillance.\nDigital tracking of pregnant people and abortion providers doesn\u2019t stop with law enforcement. The anti-choice movement has its own forensics operation: Anti-abortion activists will film people who visit or work at clinics, recording details like license plate numbers as patients and their escorts come and go. Christian fundamentalist anti-choice group Operation Rescue maintains a database, AbortionDocs.org, that lists the names, workplaces, and sometimes home addresses of abortion providers.\u00a0\nIn the late 1990s, the \u201cNuremberg Files\u201d website\u2014an AbortionDocs.org precursor run by militant anti-choice activist Neal Horsley\u2014listed the personal information, home addresses, phone numbers, and photos of 200 \u201cabortionists\u201d with fake wanted posters.\u00a0\nThat had real-life ramifications. In 1993, David Gunn and George Patterson, two Pensacola doctors whose home and clinic addresses Horsley published, were shot to death within five months of each other.\u00a0\nAfter a prolonged legal battle, a federal appeals court ruled Horsley\u2019s site a threat lacking First Amendment protections, and ordered it taken down.\u00a0\nToday, there are relatively few restrictions on private surveillance, and courts often won\u2019t grant injunctions to targets of anti-abortion surveillance or other monitoring. Some advocates see that as tacit encouragement to groups like Operation Rescue.\nOther forms of surveillance, such as geo-fencing\u2014the use of location data to target people in a given area\u2014are completely legal and widely used by all sorts of businesses. (\u201cIt\u2019s the same technology that sends you Target coupons when you walk inside a Target,\u201d says Conti-Cook.)\nWeaponized by anti-abortion activists, it can yield more destructive results. People anxiously waiting at a clinic, scrolling on their phones, have been served ads from \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d religious anti-choice operations that often target low-income women with misleading information on \u201cabortion reversal,\u201d an unsafe, unscientific method of stopping medication abortions by flooding the body with the hormone progesterone. As my colleague Stephanie Mencimer reported, one California center was caught using surveillance tech to send targeted ads.\nSo far, Massachusetts is the only state to ban geo-fencing near clinics, the result of a 2015 lawsuit in which a Boston technology company was barred from sending targeted ads on behalf of anti-choice clients. And anti-choice groups, many flush with cash, can easily pay to fill the first few pages of Google search results with crisis pregnancy centers. That\u2019s \u201cjust how Google ads work,\u201d says the digital security expert who spoke to me. \u201cIt means that anybody with enough money can willfully distort access to a free and open internet.\u201d Meta (formerly Facebook) has netted over $140,000 from ads pushing \u201cabortion reversal,\u201d which have been viewed more than 18 million times, predominantly by minors.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided in America that abortions are a consumer good,\u201d said a digital security expert I spoke with, \u201cand not a right.\u201d (The expert requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work around abortion rights.)\nIn a recent report, the Center for Intimacy Justice, which advocates equality in advertising for sexual health and wellness, found that businesses serving the health needs of women and gender-diverse populations faced unequal, often more severe monitoring and regulation of their digital ads. Advertisers under the categories of\u00a0 \u201cpregnancy,\u201d \u201cfertility,\u201d or \u201cpelvic pain\u201d frequently had their ads flagged as \u201cadult content\u201d and removed from Facebook, while ads for erectile dysfunction treatments or anti-abortion propaganda stayed online. Meta told the New York Times\u00a0that it doesn\u2019t enforce a \u201cblanket ban\u201d on adult content, but maintains stringent semantic distinctions on how sexual and reproductive health companies can promote products.\u00a0\u00a0\nLawmakers\u2019 attempts to regulate what\u2019s said and done online can cut into what limited protections do exist. The EARN IT Act, first introduced in 2020, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. If enacted, it would revise the Communications Decency Act, which grants internet providers immunity for illegal third-party content, with measures meant to curb online child abuse\u2014such as compelling companies to provide the government with \u201cbackdoors\u201d around any and all encryption, and requiring internet providers to scan much or all of their users\u2019 activity for potential red flags. The bill has been decried by privacy advocates, who argue that it would endanger activists, sex workers, and other marginalized people.\nAnother extreme bill in Oklahoma\u2019s legislature would establish a statewide government database of all people seeking abortions. Each person would be assigned a \u201cunique identifying number\u201d and connected with a \u201cpre-abortion resource\u201d assistant who is legally barred from referring actual abortion services.\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s also growing legislative momentum around consumer data protections. In 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, one of the most stringent privacy laws in the country, which allows users to opt out of the collection and sale of their data. And House Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), alongside Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) recently introduced the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act, which would curb ads targeted on the bases of \u201cprotected class information such as race, gender, and religion, and personal data.\u201d Location data, though, would still be fair game.\u00a0\nIn order to completely evade this multipronged ecosystem of surveillance, says the digital security expert, pregnant people would have to think and act like spies: concealing their browsing activity with a virtual private network, using an encrypted search engine, creating decoy emails, buying prepaid debit cards with cash, and mailing abortion medication to locations other than their home addresses.\n\u201cWe have this idea of what privacy means that comes from a time when to violate it was more work,\u201d the expert says.\u00a0\nMore realistically, they say, pregnant people, providers, and support networks can learn their rights and engage in small-scale disruptions to avoid detection\u2014especially in states that reward family, friends, or medical professionals for snitching on abortion seekers. That might mean using a public wifi connection or decoy email \u201cto figure out how to break up this long chain\u201d of data. Digital Defense Fund, for example, provides cybersecurity resources and trainings to people seeking and providing abortions.\u00a0\nIn these ways and others, Conti-Cook says, \u201cdigital and bodily autonomy are very closely related.\u201d And as their overlap grows, she sees a new opportunity to reevaluate what it means to give either\u2014or both\u2014away. The digital security expert I spoke to is \u201cfrightened\u201d by what a post-Roe future would bring, not only for abortion access, but for the right to privacy in the technological age. Cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, which protected married people\u2019s rights to contraception, or Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down laws that criminalized same-sex sexual conduct, draw on the same right to privacy the court carved out in Roe when it established the right to abortion.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t have a right to myself,\u201d says the digital security expert, \u201cthen I sure as fuck don\u2019t have a right to my phone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking for news you can trust?\n\t\t\t\t\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n\nAN IMPORTANT UPDATEWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming up short on donations month after month.
