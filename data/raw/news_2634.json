Anthony List in a statement celebrating the surge in pro-life women elected.\n\nSeven of the 13 new pro-life women flipped seats previously held by Democrats, including Nancy Mace who defeated incumbent Joe Cunningham in South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\nMace, a 42-year-old single mother of two, will now become the first Republican woman to represent the 1st Congressional District. Mace mentions among her positions that she believes the right to life is God-given.\nDiana Harshbarger, a pharmacist from Kingsport, Tennessee, won about 76 percent of the vote to serve Tennessee\u2019s 1st Congressional District. She served as Sunday school teacher of 25 years, and according to her campaign website, derives her pro-life position from her faith.\nIn one of her campaign  ads, Harshbarger says, \u201cJesus is Lord, and his light fills our lives, even through the chaos. Even as we\u2019re attacked by our neighbor, his hand and our faith will guide us to salvation.\u201d\nMary Miller, the new representative for Illinois\u2019s 15th Congressional District, said, \u201cMy family and my faith in God always come first.\u201d She has served as a Sunday school teacher and Vacation Bible School volunteer, and she attends Oakland Christian Church in Oakland, Illinois.Florida representative-elect Kat Cammack, who will become the youngest Republican woman in the House at age 32, gained the support of Baptists, Methodists, Mormons, and Catholics in her district when she launched a Faith and Pro-Life Coalition. \u201cAs a young, millennial, pro-life woman, I have the unique opportunity to engage with my generation and those younger on the importance of fighting for the unborn,\u201d she said.\nWith Democrats maintaining control of the House, Tobias said it was unlikely the pro-life representatives could advance any legislation restricting abortion, but she is \u201cthrilled\u201d to see more leaders opposed to abortion coming to the Capitol.\nIn the US Senate, three pro-life women won reelection: Wyoming\u2019s Cynthia Lummis, Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst, and West Virginia\u2019s Shelley Moore Capito. Georgia\u2019s Kelly Loeffler advanced to a runoff in January.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionPro-Life MovementU.S. CongressU.S. House of Representatives\n\nPosted by:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMegan Fowler\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Fowl_WordsNovember 6, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead These NextRelated\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs France Makes Abortion a Constitutional Right, Evangelicals Seek to Promote Culture of Life\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDespite disappointment over the vote, churches see opportunities to love and serve.\r\n\t\t\nKami Rice\nFran\u00e7aisTrending\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter 140 Years, Alliance University Will Close\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFormerly Nyack College, the school was in bad financial shape for several years.
