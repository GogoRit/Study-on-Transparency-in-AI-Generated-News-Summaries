Kim Reynolds spoke at the Prayer for Life rally organized by the Coalition of Pro-Life Leaders held in the rotunda of the Iowa State Capitol on Monday.\n\n\n\nRELATED POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool safety bills advance in Iowa Legislature\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa House panel advances a bill to reducing unemployment taxes\n\n\n\n\n\nLegislation banning guaranteed income programs advances in Iowa Senate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here today because you know that God doesn\u2019t make human beings expendable. He tells us clearly, \u2018before I formed you in your mother\u2019s womb, I knew you. And before you were born, I consecrated you.\u2019 This is the source of our rights and our dignity. Whatever courts may say today, we know God doesn\u2019t bless something unless it\u2019s of the utmost importance,\u201d she said as she thanked the pro-life activists gathered.\u00a0\nReynolds encouraged pro-life activists to remain engaged as the nation stands \u201con the brink of a historic breakthrough,\u201d referring to the\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Center\u00a0case before the Supreme Court that could potentially reverse the 1973\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision and 1992\u00a0Planned Parenthood v. Casey\u00a0decision affirming\u00a0Roe.\nReynolds was one of 11 governors to file an amicus brief supporting Mississippi\u2019s law that bans abortions after 15 weeks.\n\u201cFor half a century, elected officials and states across the country have tried to defend innocent unborn life, only to be prevented by these rulings since they were decided in 1973. As you\u2019ve heard, over 63 million babies have been aborted. Yet today, we have more reason to hope than we have since it was first decided,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in\u00a0Dobbs, which represents the court\u2019s best opportunity yet to undo its fatal mistake. The question in the case is simple. Yet all important. Does the United States Constitution require states to withhold legal protection from an entire class of defenseless human beings? The answer to that question is an emphatic no.\u201d\nReynolds pointed out the scientific advances in neonatal medicine and what has been learned about preborn babies since 1973.\u00a0\n\u201cRoe\u00a0and\u00a0Casey\u00a0rule out even the most basic legal protections for these vulnerable, precious babies. They can\u2019t be reconciled with the most basic understanding of human rights, let alone with the truth that, like us, unborn children are made in the image and likeness of God,\u201d she said.\nReynolds criticized the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 decision that ruled the Iowa Constitution protects abortion rights.\u00a0\n\u201cThe decision has already made his presence felt. Within a year of taking office, I signed one of the nation\u2019s first bills designed to ensure that an abortion could never stop a beating heart. But it was halted by a district court judge who said it violated our constitution. The people who actually wrote Iowa\u2019s constitution said nothing about abortion. What they did write was this: \u2018All men by nature are free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty.\u2019 Those words aren\u2019t just beautiful; they\u2019re also very straightforward. In Iowa, innocent life should be protected, not discarded, yet with one ruling, Iowa\u2019s laws went from one of the most pro-life in the country to one of the least,\u201d she argued.\nReynolds recounted calling for a constitutional amendment to clarify that the Iowa Constitution does not provide a right to abortion or the taxpayer funding of abortion. The Iowa Legislature passed that during the 2021 session, and it will need to pass it again during the 90th General Assembly before Iowans vote on whether to ratify it.\nShe said her administration is also defending the 24-hour waiting period law that was recently passed and challenged in court.\u00a0\nThe make-up of the Iowa Supreme Court has changed, so Reynolds hopes that it will reverse course, calling the law a \u201ccommon-sense measure.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a chance for the state Supreme Court to reaffirm what the framers of Iowa\u2019s constitution expressed so eloquently, that every human life is precious,\u201d she said.\nReynolds encouraged those in attendance to stay the course.ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cWe\u2019re closer than ever to one of our foremost goals. So now is the time to keep pushing to keep speaking up. And most of all, to keep those prayers coming. Because like you, I won\u2019t rest until our laws and our society recognize that all people, no matter how small, are entitled to the right to life,\u201d she concluded.\u00a0\nSeveral lawmakers spoke before Reynolds.\nState Rep. Steve Holt, R-Denison, complained that society has strayed from the faith-based values of America\u2019s founders.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have seen our nation veer further and further away from basic moral imperatives to the point that our nation is hardly recognizable anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cRiots in our streets attempt to legitimize stealing from others, demands by the LGBT community and pop culture that we deny biology and accept their alternate version of reality. A breakdown of discipline throughout our society.\u201d\nHolt pointed out that abortion, once characterized as needing to be \u201clegal, safe, and rare,\u201d is now celebrated as \u201csomething to be proud of in total disregard for the soul that is lost.\u201d\nHe said progressives seek to \u201cdestroy all norms of morality in our society in favor of their new order.\u201d\u00a0\nHolt later pointed out that the government ultimately can not solve the problem of abortion or the nation\u2019s moral decay.\u00a0\n\u201cI will say to you that government is not the solution here. Government is merely reflective of what is going on in our society, we have to pray for revival folks big time, we have to pray for revival,\u201d he said.\nIowa Senate President Jake Chapman, R-Adel, pointed to the Declaration of Independence, stating America\u2019s founders had it right.\n\u201cThese rights: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable, which means they are inherent in us, in each of us. As such, these rights cannot be taken away, nor can they be granted. Often, rights or laws allow, or they may restrict your rights. However, when rights are unalienable, no power of government or man should be permitted to restrain or abridge those rights. Our founders were not mistaken in the order of these unalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Without life, there is no liberty, and without life and liberty, there is no pursuit of happiness,\u201d he said.\nChapman called Iowans to action.\u00a0\n\u201cAlbert Einstein is credited with the following quote, the world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watched them without doing anything,\u201d he said.\nChapman ended with invoking God\u2019s blessing, \u201cMay we never be found standing silent. May God grant us wisdom as we fight valiantly for the cause of life. May he hear the cries of those who have had their voices silenced. May He move in the hearts of those who are conflicted in preserving life. May He heal the wounds of those who live life with regrets, and may God bless each and every one of you as we take on the valiant cause of defending life.\u201d\nEarlier, State Senator Mark Costello, R-Imogene, updated those in attendance about the \u201cMOMS Bill,\u201d\u00a0SF 2354, a priority for pro-life activists during this legislative session.\u00a0\nThe bill requires the Iowa Department of Humans Services to create a statewide \u201cMore Options for Maternal Support (MOMS)\u201d program to promote healthy pregnancies and childbirth through nonprofit organizations that provide pregnancy support services.\u00a0\nCostello reported the bill made it through the Iowa Senate Ways and Means Committee and a Ways and Means subcommittee. The legislation that has appropriations connected to it is funnel proof.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re making good progress on this bill,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had surveys that show that the main reason that women choose to have an abortion is because they don\u2019t feel the support that they need, they (would) like to have the baby but they don\u2019t see how they can manage it. And so this is to try and help with that process,\u201d Costello added.\nHe explained that the bill will \u201cput more money into that system help build a more robust network of people who are willing to try and help young women who are in an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy, to go ahead and follow through with that.\u201d\u00a0\nThe rally also included a time of prayer with an opening prayer by Pastor Steven Wonbenyakeh of Alive Church in Ames and then closing in prayer led by Brenda Schaffer with Passion Church in Davenport and Pastor Todd Stiles of First Family Church in Ankeny.\nReaders can watch the entire rally in a video provided by The FAMiLY Leader below:\n\nTags: 2022 Iowa Legislative Session89th General Assemblyabortionabortion debateIowa Coalition of Pro-Life LeadersJake ChapmanKim ReynoldsMark Costellopro-life agendaSteve Holt\n\n\n\n\nShareTweetShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrevious Post\nReynolds ranked 13th best governor in ALEC\u2019s economic freedom report\n\n\nNext Post\nErnst: \u201cDefending freedom in Ukraine is defending freedom everywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShane Vander Hart\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tShane Vander Hart is the editor of The Iowa Torch.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\n\nIowa Republicans respond to Biden\u2019s State of the Union Address\n\n March 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nState Government\n\n\n\n\nIowa Legislature passes the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\n March 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nNaig: Securing Iowa\u2019s valuable farmland\n\n February 29, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nState Government\n\n\n\n\nFederal appeals court upholds Iowa\u2019s law banning mask mandates\n\n February 29, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nHenrickson & Everson: Iowa\u2019s historic tax reform opporutnity\n\n February 29, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nState Government\n\n\n\n\nForeign land ownership bill heads to Reynolds\u2019 desk\n\n February 27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNext Post\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                        Ernst: \u201cDefending freedom in Ukraine is defending freedom everywhere.\u201d                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                        Schultz: Support for the bottle bill is strong                    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Sign-Up For Our Daily Updates\nGet The Iowa Torch right in your inbox!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nPlease wait...\n\n\n                                    Subscribe                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReynolds releases Christmas message to Iowans\n\n December 22, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeenstra: Iowa farmland belongs to Iowa farmers\n\n February 8, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState to Launch New Program in 2022 to Help Connect Unemployed Iowans with Jobs\n\n October 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool safety bills advance in Iowa Legislature\n\n\n\n 0 shares\n\nShare 0\nTweet 0\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa House panel advances a bill to reducing unemployment taxes\n\n\n\n 0 shares\n\nShare 0\nTweet 0\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa Republicans respond to Biden\u2019s State of the Union Address\n\n\n\n 0 shares\n\nShare 0\nTweet 0\n\n\n\n\n\nLegislation banning guaranteed income programs advances in Iowa Senate\n\n\n\n 0 shares\n\nShare 0\nTweet 0\n\n\n\n\n\nFeenstra: Holding illegal immigrants accountable for their crimes\n\n\n\n 0 shares\n\nShare 0\nTweet 0\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Iowa Torch\u200b is a for-profit, news organization that focuses on political news as it relates to Iowans\n\n\nCategories\n\nCurrent Events\n\nEducation\n\nFederal Government\n\nIowa History\n\nLocal Government\n\nNews\n\nOpinion\n\nPolitics\n\nState Government\n\nUncategorized\n\nUncategorized\n\n\n\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nPlease wait...\n\n\n                                    Subscribe                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022\u00a0The Iowa Torch, a publication of 4:15 Communications, LLC.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        No Result    \n\n View All Result    \n\nHome\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nContact Us\nState Government\nFederal Government\nLocal Government\nPolitics\nEducation\nOpinion\n \n\n\n    \n\u00a9 2022 The Iowa Torch, a publication of 4:15 Communications, LLC.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
