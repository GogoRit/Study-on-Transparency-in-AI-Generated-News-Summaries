(AP) \u2014 Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sued Thursday to protect abortion rights, asking a Michigan court to recognize a right to abortion under the state constitution and to overturn a 176-year-old ban in the state that may take effect if the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling is vacated.\nThe Democratic governor\u2019s preemptive lawsuit, which was filed in Oakland County against prosecutors in 13 counties with an abortion clinic, came as the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority considers allowing states to ban abortion much earlier in pregnancy and potentially overturning the right. Planned Parenthood of Michigan and its chief medical officer filed a similar suit in the state Court of Claims to block enforcement of the 1931 law, which dates to an 1846 ban.\nWATCH: Oklahoma Legislature bans most abortions following a national trend\nWhitmer, who is up for reelection this year, was expected to request that the Michigan Supreme Court quickly take her case rather than let it wind through lower trial and appellate courts. A favorable decision could enable abortions to continue in Michigan after the federal high court rules.\n\u201cIt was important for us to take action now, to ensure that women and providers across the state of Michigan know whether abortions will still be available in the state because it impacts their lives and our health care providers\u2019 practices. It\u2019s crucial that we take this action now to secure and ensure that the Michigan Constitution protects this right that we have had available for 49 years,\u201d the governor told The Associated Press, saying nearly 2.2 million women may lose access to a safe, legal medical procedure.\nMichigan is among eight states with an unenforced abortion ban that was enacted before the 1973 Roe decision legalized abortion nationwide. States on both sides of the abortion issue have been taking a variety of steps to prepare for Roe being eroded or rescinded, including making it a crime to perform an abortion and banning legal action against people who aid or receive an abortion.\nMichigan\u2019s law makes it a felony to use an instrument or administer any substance with the intent \u201cto procure the miscarriage\u201d of a woman unless necessary to preserve her life.\nWhitmer wants the Michigan Supreme Court to declare a state constitutional right to abortion and to strike down the 1931 law, which could go back into effect if Roe is overturned or weakened. The lawsuit argues that the law is invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution.\nMichigan could soon be left with a near-total ban without even exceptions for rape and incest \u2014 \u201cone of the most extreme laws in the country,\u201d Whitmer said. Her call to repeal the law has gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled Legislature.\nThe state high court has four Democratic and three Republican justices.\nREAD MORE: California governor signs law that makes abortions cheaper\nWhitmer will ask that the court intervene in part to avoid legal uncertainty when the federal high court issues its ruling on Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe complaint says that while the Michigan Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that Roe limited the effect of the state ban, the right to abortion has been undermined over 50 years of litigation in federal courts. The state\u2019s high court has not said whether the state constitution protects the right. The Michigan Court of Appeals, in 1997, ruled there is no state constitutional right to abortion \u2014 a reason the Michigan Supreme Court should step in immediately, according to her office.\nThe lawsuit points to \u201csubstantial ambiguity\u201d about what the state ban prohibits.\nAbortion rights advocates have launched a ballot drive to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution but need about 425,000 voter signatures to put the initiative on the November ballot.\nAlso Thursday, seven Democratic county prosecutors who were named in the lawsuit pledged to not enforce the anti-abortion law.\n\u201cWe cannot and will not support criminalizing reproductive freedom or creating unsafe, untenable situations for health care providers and those who seek abortions in our communities,\u201d said the elected prosecutors in Wayne, Oakland, Genesee, Washtenaw, Ingham, Kalamazoo and Marquette counties.\n\u201cInstead, we will continue to dedicate our limited resources towards the prosecution of serious crimes and the pursuit of justice for all.\u201d\nThe other six elected prosecutors who were sued are Republicans.\nAssociated Press writer Corey Williams in West Bloomfield, Michigan, contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:\n                Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer addresses the media about the flooding along the Tittabawassee River, after several dams breached, in downtown Midland, Michigan, U.S., May 20, 2020.
