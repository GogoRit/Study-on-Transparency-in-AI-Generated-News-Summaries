Across the United States, approximately 200,000 women are incarcerated\u2014nearly an 800 percent increase since 1980. Women of color are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. In 2017, twice as many Black women and 1.3 times as many Hispanic women were incarcerated compared to white women. An often overlooked aspect of the increasing rates of women\u2019s incarceration is the impact on the sexual and reproductive health needs of these women. \u201cDespite being the fastest growing incarcerated population, women and girls are correctional afterthoughts,\u201d writes Kimberly Haven, an activist and formerly incarcerated woman who had to undergo a hysterectomy\u2014a surgical procedure to remove the uterus (and, with it, childbearing possibilities)\u2014after being denied proper menstrual products while incarcerated.Reproductive Justice for Women in Prison\u201cPrisons have been designed along a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 model based on a population of men,\u201d where uniquely female conditions like menstruation, menopause, obstetrics, and gynecologic care are not given strong consideration, wrote Jeanne Flavin in Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women\u2019s Reproduction in America. In prison, women\u2019s reproductive justice\u2014the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children they have in safe and sustainable communities\u2014is often disregarded, even though 85 percent of incarcerated women are of childbearing age and 80 percent of women in jail are mothers.\u00a0A common reproductive injustice incarcerated women face is lack of access to proper menstrual products. Thirty-eight states have no laws to require the distribution of period products to incarcerated people. Menstrual products are often scarce, withheld from incarcerated women at the will of correctional officers, or only available to those who can pay for them. When menstrual products are provided to women, they are \u201csubpar products you would never buy outside of the carceral system,\u201d such as pads that are too thin or that lack adhesive properties to keep them in place. Women must often create their own period products to make do, which can cause infections and other health concerns.Prisons are, by design, a tool of social control and reduced personal freedoms and choice. This is particularly evident when it comes to a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. Incarcerated women technically have the legal right to an abortion, but since women are incarcerated at the federal, state, and local levels, and abortion laws vary by state, the lived experiences of incarcerated women seeking abortions are also quite varied. Prisons often exercise control over women by denying or delaying their access to abortion services. Furthermore, access to abortion in prison is a practical challenge\u2014abortions are not performed in correctional facilities, so women must travel to abortion clinics. Inmates are typically required to pay for the abortion, transportation, and staff time. Additionally, women have reported being coerced into having abortions, especially when they have been raped by prison guards.Pregnancy and Motherhood Behind BarsWomen\u2019s reproductive health needs do not disappear when they are incarcerated. An estimated 12,000 women are pregnant while serving time (although no government agency officially tracks this) and about 2,000 women give birth while incarcerated each year. According to the Bureau of Justice Assistance, \u201c4 percent of state and 3 percent of federal inmates said they were pregnant at the time of admission,\u201d and an estimated 5 percent of women in jails reported being pregnant. Unfortunately, the rate of pregnancy in juvenile justice facilities is unknown, as it is not typically tracked by the facilities or any federal agency.\u00a0The majority of pregnancies of incarcerated women are considered high-risk due to pre-existing social factors surrounding poverty, including poor nutrition, limited access to prenatal care, domestic violence, mental illness, sexually transmitted infections, and drug and alcohol dependence. While high-risk pregnancies require increased medical attention, many prisoners receive little to no education about prenatal care, lack regular pelvic exams or sonograms, and don\u2019t have the freedom to alter their diets to address their changing dietary needs.Until the 2018 First Step Act outlawed the use of shackles on prisoners during pregnancy, incarcerated women in labor were typically transported to a hospital in shackles and gave birth shackled to a hospital bed. \u201cThe practice of shackling pregnant women and women in labor is principally a remnant of protocols designated for male institutions and is not based on genuine security concerns,\u201d according to the AMA Journal of Ethics, as most women are incarcerated on non-violent charges.When incarcerated women give birth, they are almost immediately separated from their newborn child. Fewer than a dozen states have nurseries in prisons, so typically babies are separated from their mothers within 24 hours after birth. This creates deep emotional issues for the mother and impacts the child\u2019s health and well-being. Incarceration also affects a mother\u2019s ability to breastfeed, which can impact mother-infant attachment, post-partum depression, and psychological benefits for both mother and child.Gender-Based Violence Incarcerated women often face sexual harassment, assault, and rape from fellow inmates, as well as prison guards. Correctional officers can use their position of power to control incarcerated women; for example, guards sometimes coerce women into sex in exchange for menstrual products or contact with their children. Sexual violence in correctional facilities can also come under the guise of reproductive health services, like pelvic or breast exams.Most women who give birth while incarcerated are pregnant when detained, but some prison births are the result of rape by prison guards. According to federal law, consent cannot be freely given between prisoners and prison guards, as guards have complete control over an inmate\u2019s life. However, it is known that rape and sexual assault in prisons is common partly due to the dehumanization of female prisoners.There remains much work to be done to ensure that incarcerated women\u2019s reproductive needs are met. Experts recommend further research to better understand incarcerated women\u2019s experiences accessing abortion and other health services, the establishment of standard policy guidelines to improve the overall health of incarcerated women, and increased education within the correctional system about incarcerated women\u2019s legal rights in order to protect their reproductive rights and justice.Sources: American Civil Liberties Union, American Journal of Public Health, American Medical Association Journal of Ethics, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Casetext, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Guttmacher Institute, National Commission on Correctional Health Care, National Council on Crime and Delinquency, National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, New York Times, \u201cOur Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women\u2019s Reproduction in America,\u201d PBS, Prison Policy Initiative, SisterSong The Marshall Project, The American Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, The Sentencing Project, UCLA Women\u2019s Law JournalPhoto Credit:\u00a0Woman in prison wearing orange jumpsuit sitting behind bars.\u00a0kittirat roekburi/Shutterstock.com, All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\nTopics:\nDot-Mom, \n\tGBV, \n\tgender, \n\thuman rights, \n\tmaternal health, \n\trespectful care, \n\tsexual and reproductive health \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJoin the Conversation \nRSS\nsubscribe\nfacebook\nG+\ntwitter\niTunes\npodomatic\nyoutube\n\n\nTweets by NewSecurityBeat \n\n\n\nTrending Stories \n\nFeatured Media \n\n\n\n\nBackdraft\nPodcasts\n\n\n\nMore \u00bb\nWhat You're Saying\n\n\nClosing the Women\u2019s Health Gap Report: Much Needed Recognition for Endometriosis and Menopause\n\nAditya Belose: This blog effectively highlights the importance of recognizing conditions like endometriosis &...\n\n\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day 2024: Investment Can Promote Equality\n\nAditya Belose: This is a powerful and informative blog on the importance of investing in women for gender equality!...\n\n\n\nA Warmer Arctic Presents Challenges and Opportunities\n\nDan Strombom: The link to the Georgetown report did not work\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Security and Critical Minerals Mining in Latin America: How Can Business Help?\n\nClimate Security at USAID: (Re)defining an Integrative Issue\n\nThe Complex Dance Around China\u2019s Overseas Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS Feed\nYouTube\nTwitter\nFacebook\n Home\nWho We Are\nPublications\nEvents\nWilson Center\nContact Us\nPrint Friendly Page\n \n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2007-2024.
