Many of these exposures appear in everyday life, from pesticides to ingredients found in personal care products. These exposures may pose long-term adverse reproductive effects.\nMethods\n1. Research in the Curl Agricultural Health Lab.\nContributes to the epidemiological methodology analyzing the exposure of glyphosate, the active ingredient in some herbicides.\n\nRecruiting 40 pregnant women (first trimester).\nCollecting a series of 36 urine samples and analyzing by measuring specific gravity, color, and clarity.\n\n2. Conducting a search for peer-reviewed literature.\nContributes to the findings for the impact of personal care items on reproductive health.\n\nUsing Google Scholar, PubMed, Academic Search Premier.\nUsing keywords like \u201cpersonal care items,\u201d \u201creproductive health,\u201d \u201ccarcinogens,\u201d and \u201cenvironmental exposures.\u201d\nEnsuring each finding is from relevant and peer-reviewed material.\n\nResults\nWhile the study on exposure to glyphosate is ongoing, this literature review aims to highlight the potential environmental exposure risks in order understand the effects to reproductive health and birth outcomes.\nRelevant Data from Literature Findings\nPrevious environmental exposure studies indicate a connection between exposure to chemicals in personal-care products and long-term adverse reproductive effects. This underscores the importance of understanding in-utero exposures and suggests it may be useful to look at the reproductive effects of other chemicals including herbicides.\nKey Results of Literature Search\nFemale College Student Awareness of Exposures to Environmental Toxins in Personal Care Products and Their Effect on Preconception Health (Barrett, R. Chalupka,SM., Chan LM. ) Worcester State University Feb 2015 Accessed by: Sage Journals\nReproductive Environmental Health (Guidice, LC., Sutton, P, Woodruff, T J.) University of California\nJuly 2019 Accessed by: NCBI\nChanges in Cosmetics Use during Pregnancy and Risk Perception by Women (Cabut,M. ,Sophie, C., Sauvant-Rochat, MP.) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health\nMarch 2016 Accessed by: MDPI\nSummary of Literature Findings\nFigure 1. The percentage of female college students 18-24 (within child-bearing age), who use personal care products daily. (Barrett, R. Chalupka,SM., Chan LM. )\n\u201cThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 99% to 100% of pregnant women are exposed to a variety of chemicals, including banned insecticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) that may be harmful to a developing fetus.\u201d\nFigure 2. \u201cWindows of Susceptibility,\u201d During these times exposure to environmental contaminants can have immediate and long-term consequences to one\u2019s health. (Giudice, Linda C., Sutton, Patrice., Woodruff, Tracey J.)\n\u201cA recent analysis of CDC population prevalence data found virtually all pregnant women in the U.S. have body burdens of\u00a0all\u00a0of the following reproductive/developmental toxicants: lead, mercury, toluene, perchlorate, bis-phenol A (BPA), and some phthalates, pesticides, perfluorochemicals (PFCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs).\u201d\nFigure 3. The increased risk of unsafe cosmetic use during pregnancy. (Cabut, Sophie, Sauvant-Rochat, 2016)\n\u201cAlmost half of the women (45%) in our study considered that there was no risk in using cosmetics during pregnancy.\u201d \u201c\u2026.it is now recognized that these products contain numerous potentially harmful chemical substances including plasticizers, bisphenol A, parabens, synthetic dyes, benzophenones, antimicrobials, dioxane, formaldehyde and heavy metals.\u201d\nConclusion\nPrevious environmental exposure studies indicate the dangers of exposures such as, the link between exposure to personal-care product ingredients and the long-term reproductive effects in women. Together, these studies have the potential to assist in clinical risk assessments and further exposure reduction.\nAdditional Information\nFor questions or comments about this research, contact Alyssa Jo Romero at alyssaromero@u.boisestate.edu.\n\n\n\n\nShare This\nShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInShare through Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Poster Sessions\nReturn to Virtual Poster Sessions Main Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Posts\n\n\n\n\nOlder Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Undergraduate Research\n\n\nstudentresearch@boisestate.edu\n\n\n(208) 426-1905\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1910 University Drive, Boise, ID 83725\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFollow Us\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Navigation\n\nmyBoiseStateSafety, Security and SupportCareer OpportunitiesBoise State Public RadioAlbertsons LibraryTransportation and ParkingPartner with UsMorrison CenterAlumniBronco Shop and BookstoreUniversity AdministrationExtraMile Arena\n\n\n\nBroncos Logo\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on X\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of UseAccessibilityPrivacyClassroom ConcernsPoliciesContact Boise State\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    \u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Boise State University.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
