After consultations with more than 130 people (including more than 90 young people), the IAWG ASRH Sub-Working Group is ready to share and disseminate the Toolkit. The Toolkit was revised over the past year to align with updated guidance from the 2018 Inter-Agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings and the Minimum Initial Service Package for Sexual and Reproductive Health in Crisis Situations.\nEverything is online!\nYou can access the Toolkit, as well as individual chapters, annexed tools, and all referenced resources on the IAWG website. Click the button at the top of each page to select the documents you want to download. The Arabic, French, and Spanish versions will be available by the end of 2020, and IAWG will share those versions as they become available. During consultations and webinar sessions, humanitarian practitioners and young people expressed the need for practical, useful guidance with many tools and resources that can be adapted for their context. As a result, nearly all of the 29 annexed tools are available in Microsoft Word and Excel versions so that you can download, edit, and start using the tools! IAWG has also included a companion guide to help you navigate the Toolkit.\nIAWG would like to extend its deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who participated in the revision of the Toolkit, and is eager to hear about how you use the toolkit to improve the lives of adolescents and youth.\n\n\n\n\nReport details\n\nPrimary country\n\nWorld\n\nSource\n\nInter-agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises\n\nFormat\n\nManual and Guideline\n\nThemes\n\nCoordinationFood and NutritionHealthProtection and Human RightsShelter and Non-Food ItemsWater Sanitation Hygiene\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nShare this on Facebook\n\n\nShare this on Twitter\n\n\nPost this on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n+ 14 more\n\nUNHCR Appel Global 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Appeal          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n9 Jan 2024\n\nOriginally published\n\n9 Jan 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n+ 14 more\n\nUNHCR Global Appeal 2024\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Appeal          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n23 Nov 2023\n\nOriginally published\n\n23 Nov 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\nUNHCR Global Report 2022\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Other          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n26 Oct 2023\n\nOriginally published\n\n26 Oct 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\nRapport Global 2022\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n            Other          \nSource\n\nUNHCR\n\nPosted\n\n24 Jul 2023\n\nOriginally published\n\n24 Jul 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to ReliefWeb Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not fill in this field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLabs\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService provided by\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\nUN OCHA\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      OCHA coordinates the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.
