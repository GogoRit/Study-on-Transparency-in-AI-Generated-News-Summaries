Is it right to hire a killer to solve a problem?\". The Pope's letter concludes with a blessing for the women and a request to pray for him.\nThe concern of women\u2019s network\nIn their correspondence,\u00a0 the women\u2019s network express their grievances to the Pope, especially at a time when an abortion bill has been presented by many quarters as an easy solution for adolescents living in the suburbs and facing unexpected pregnancies.\n\u201cWe are overwhelmed by cold terror, if we think that this bill aims to cultivate the idea that abortion is one more possibility in the range of contraceptive methods and that its main target groups are poor girls\u201d, they write.\n\u00a0\u201cOur voice, like that of unborn children, is never heard\u201d, lament the women.\u00a0\n\u201cThe legislators and the press do not want to listen to us and if\u2026we did not have priests raising their voices for us, we would be even more alone\u201d. \u201cOur teenage daughters\u201d, they point out, \u201care growing up with the idea that they do not have the right to have children because they are poor\u201d.\nMarch for life\nOn Saturday, 28 November, in Argentina, there will be several protests against the abortion bill. One of them is called the \u201cMarch of the slippers\u201d which will see participants gather in Buenos Aires, in front of the headquarters of the National Congress, to pray the Rosary and place the lives of the unborn under the protection of the Virgin Mary.\nThe protests have received the support of the local bishops, who on several occasions reaffirmed the importance of protecting life from conception to its natural end. On 20 November, the Episcopal Commission for Life, Laity and Family (CEVILAF), in a note, deplored the bill currently under discussion, reiterating that \u201cfor the first time, in Argentina and in democracy, a law could be passed that includes the death of one person to save another\u201d. \u201cOnly by saving both lives\u201d, \u00a0the Commission reiterated, \u201ccan we all be saved\u201d.\nFinally, CEVILAF urged the faithful to join the demonstrations on Saturday, as they are \u201cpublic expressions in favour of the human right to life that every person has and is guaranteed by the Constitution\u201d.\n\nThank you for reading our article.
