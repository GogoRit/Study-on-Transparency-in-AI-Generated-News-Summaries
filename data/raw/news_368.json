Leverhulme Early Career Fellow and Lecturer in Human Geography, has written an opinion piece for The Conversation in response to a new law relating to access to abortion in Poland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished on: \n3 November 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n  People protesting against stricter abortion laws in front of the Polish parliament.\r\n\nEnormous protests\u00a0are taking place across Poland in response to a new ruling\u00a0striking down\u00a0part of the 1993 abortion law \u2013 something that effectively amounts to a legal ban in a country that already took a very restrictive approach to abortion.\nAbortion was previously allowed on three grounds. The constitutional court has ruled that the provision allowing abortion in the case of severe foetal anomaly is unconstitutional and is therefore banned. The remaining grounds for legal abortion in Poland are when the pregnancy threatens life or health or when the pregnancy is the result of rape.\nOver the last three years as part of my research on medication abortion and changing patterns of abortion access, I\u2019ve interviewed many pro-choice activists inside Poland and in the countries where Polish abortion-seekers travel. What they\u2019ve told me reveals the dark realities of abortion in Poland today as well as the mobilised and energetic cross-border networks of activists who are prepared to fight back.\nThis court ruling removes the grounds upon which the vast majority of abortions take place in Poland. In 2017,\u00a0Polish government data\u00a0reported that 1,035 of the 1,057 abortions (97.9%) that took place were on the grounds of severe foetal anomaly. The proportion of abortions carried out on this ground has steadily increased every year since 1994: while abortions to preserve life or health accounted for 88.1% of all legal abortions in 1994, by 2017 they had fallen to 2.1%.\nMeanwhile, abortion on the grounds of rape is vanishingly rare in Poland today. In 2017,\u00a0not a single termination\u00a0on these grounds was granted, in a country of 38 million people. Termination on the grounds of severe foetal anomaly was, effectively, the only way to obtain a legal abortion in the Polish medical system.\nObtaining an abortion\nObtaining a legal abortion in Poland already took weeks or months because of administrative barriers and opposition from obstructive doctors, and these delays will be exacerbated by the new ruling.\nIn some regions of eastern Poland, it is\u00a0effectively impossible\u00a0to obtain an abortion because all medical facilities have declared themselves conscientious objectors to abortion. In other regions, legal advocates\u00a0report that\u00a0anti-abortion doctors deliberately delay patients, mislead them about their legal entitlement to abortion, or tell them that such procedures are not available in their region.\nPro-choice lawyers advise patients on how to prepare for such doctors, even suggesting they obtain stamped proof that hospitals have received their abortion requests. Otherwise, these documents can \u201cdisappear\u201d and hospitals can claim that they received \u2013 and refused \u2013 no requests for abortion.\nThe process of obtaining a legal abortion can be so exhausting that lawyers find that Polish abortion-seekers who are refused by hospitals often choose not to take up legal proceedings. Instead, many travel abroad, search for a clandestine provider inside Poland, or continue their pregnancy.\nPoland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws, like all such laws, do not reduce the demand for abortion, nor do they reduce the number of abortions overall. In fact, the Polish laws serve to create a\u00a0huge demand\u00a0for self-managed abortion with pills and abortion travel to other countries.\nThere is an enormous gulf between abortions that take place in the formal medical sector \u2013 approved by doctors, carried out in hospitals \u2013 and the large number of clandestine or informal abortions that take place in Poland. Even recognising these clandestine abortion is politically contested: while the UN estimates between\u00a080,000 and 180,000 abortions\u00a0per year, the Polish government claims this number is fewer than 10,000.\nAbortions that take place in clandestine settings are not technically illegal because Polish law does not make it a crime to end your own pregnancy. But it does make it a crime for anyone \u2013 doctor, spouse, friend, parent \u2013 to help another person end a pregnancy, including by helping them to travel abroad for abortion.\nBy pill or plane\nSelf-managed abortion with pills is on the rise, according to the Polish activists who provide information on how to find and take abortion pills. These activists\u00a0observe growing demand\u00a0for pills based on the numbers of people who contact them in search of information. The secretive nature of self-managed abortion means no precise data can be collected on country-wide demand for or use of abortion pills.\nThe medical \u201cunderground\u201d still exists in Poland, where doctors provide abortions for cash inside private clinics or home offices, but doctors providing this kind of abortion are\u00a0fewer each year. The activists who support self-managed abortion in Poland are actually glad about this because they report that these doctors tend to charge very high fees and use outdated surgical abortion methods. Today, many Polish women turn to international organisations like\u00a0Women Help Womenand\u00a0Women on Web, both based in the Netherlands, who have supplied abortion pills there for a decade.\nSelf-managed abortion with pills is transformational for abortion access in Poland. But because the pills can only be used safely in outpatient settings in the first trimester, access to pills is not a replacement for safe, legal and local care: self-managed abortion is not suitable for later abortions when medical risks increase. People who need to end pregnancies with severe anomalies will now be forced to travel abroad, mainly to England and the Netherlands, where abortion care is available to 24 and 22 weeks respectively.\nThe activist coalition\u00a0Abortion Without Borders, launched last year, helps people in Poland to obtain abortion in several countries, directing them to different member groups depending on their gestation, medical circumstances, and ability to travel. Across Poland today, protesters are painting the phone number for Abortion Without Borders\u00a0on walls and even churches.\nPoland\u2019s courts have struck down a fundamental plank of its abortion law. This will not reduce the demand for abortion in Poland nor will it deter women from taking clandestine steps to obtain it. Restrictive abortion laws simply increase the proportion of abortions that take place in secret and unsafe conditions.\nThis opinion piece was originally\u00a0published in The Conversation on 26 October 2020.\n\n\n\n\nRelated items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News story: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nKeeping faith: Research reveals pandemic lessons to help sustain and grow faith communities \r\n\r\n  \n\n7 December 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News story: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen Mary research exposes coastal landfill time bomb\r\n\r\n  \n\n30 November 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News story: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQueen Mary academics win prestigious European research funding \r\n\r\n  \n\n22 November 2022\n\n\n\n\nFor media information, contact:\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter navigation\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation\nAlumni\nA-Z Schools and institutes\nCareers and Enterprise\nCollaborate with us\nContact\nEvents\nGlobal\nHow to find us\nInternational students\nJobs\nLibrary\nMyQMUL\nNew students\nNews\nOrder a prospectus\nOur brand\nParents\nProfessional services departments\nPublic Engagement\nQMplus\nStaff directory\nStaff intranet\nStrategy 2030\nStudents' Union\nTeachers\nTerm dates\nTrade Union Facility Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy and cookies\nSite map\nModern Slavery Statement\nSupplier fraud alert\nOFS Data\n\n\n\nContact the university\nQueen Mary University of London\n          Mile End Road\n          London E1 4NS\n          +44 (0) 20 7882 5555\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n"
