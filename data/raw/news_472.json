Be the first to know.Subscribe\u201cWith advances in medical science, it has become obvious that the fetus is much more than \u2018just pregnancy tissue,\u2019 as some would claim,\u201d the letter says.\u201cThere can be no equivocation that the fetus is a living, learning and actively participating human being. Every one of these lives has inherent value and dignity. They deserve to be embraced and protected by the citizens of Colorado, as equal members of our society.\u201dThe doctors also said that when \u201cthe pregnancy itself places the mother\u2019s health at risk after 22 weeks, we know that delivery of the baby is safer and quicker than a multi-day abortion procedure.\u201d\u201cWe do not believe that any of the challenges a woman faces after 22 weeks of pregnancy necessitate the senseless destruction of a human life,\u201d they argued.In April 1967, Colorado became the first state in the country to legalize abortion, passing a bill that allowed for abortion in certain circumstances and with the approval of a three-doctor panel.At present, Colorado does not have any legal restrictions on late-term abortion, although the state does require parental notification for minors and that a licensed doctor perform the procedure.The Due Date Too Late campaign, a pro-life group, launched an effort known as Initiative 120, later renamed Proposition 115, to ban late-term abortion in the state.In June, the secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that the campaign had collected enough valid signatures to get the measure on the November ballot.To qualify for the ballot, pro-life advocates had to get at least 124,632 verified signatures in support. Due Date Too Late ended up getting more than 153,000 confirmed signatures.The doctors\u2019 statement in support of Proposition 115 comes several days after around 120 faith leaders signed a letter expressing opposition to the ballot measure. \u00a0The letter, posted Sept. 8 on the website of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado, included controversial Lutheran pastor Nadi Bolz-Weber among its signatories.\u201cIt would allow politics to dictate personal health decisions that should be made by a woman and her family in consultation with her healthcare providers,\u201d it read in part.\u201cAs faith leaders rooted in our vision of a better and more just world, we cannot remain silent when politicians and groups attempt to infringe upon the inherent rights of others, especially when they use their interpretation of their religion as justification to do so.\u201dFollow Michael Gryboski on  Twitter  or FacebookWas this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
