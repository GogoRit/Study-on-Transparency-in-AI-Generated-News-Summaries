Are you going to say Super Bowl, or we saved a lot of babies?'\"Get Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.SubscribeThe 2007 Heisman trophy winner directed those in attendance to join the \u201crescue mission.\u201d\u201cYou know why we call it a rescue mission? Because when we say that, it puts a timeline on it,\" he explained.\u00a0\"When's the last time you heard a rescue mission taking place in a month or a few years. No, a rescue mission means now. It gives you a sense of urgency. It says we have to go not because it's our time but because it's their time \u2026 I have to live a sense of urgency because while I might have time, they don't,\" he continued.\u00a0Tebow shared that the issue of abortion is a personal one for him because his mother was once encouraged to abort him. The athlete and his mom shared their story in a 2010 Super Bowl commercial for Focus on the Family. He recounted the story at the banquet.\"You see, my mom 32 years ago had doctors tell her she needed to abort me because if she didn't, it was going to cost her life. And they didn't even believe that I was a baby,\" he recalled. \"They thought I was a tumor.\u201dThe Florida native added, \"When I was born, they found out the placenta wasn\u2019t actually attached. So the doctor looked at my mom after 37 years of being a doctor and said, \u2018This is the biggest miracle I\u2019ve ever seen because I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s alive.\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m so grateful that my mom trusted God with my life and her life.\u201dThe recently married 32-year-old joked that his parents prayed he\u2019d grow up and be a preacher but instead got a quarterback. However, Tebow has used his influence to spread the Gospel. From outwardly praying on the field or wearing \"John 3:16\" on his eye black while in pro football to sharing about Jesus in most of his mainstream interviews, Tebow has been using his platform to promote his Christain values.\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here matters,\" he concluded. \"You\u2019re fighting for life. You\u2019re fighting for people that can\u2019t fight for themselves. And my question to you is: Are you willing to stand up in the face of persecution, in the face of adversity, in the face of criticism, when other people are going to say it\u2019s not worth it, when other people won\u2019t stand beside you?\"Was this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe\u2019re sorry to hear that.Hope you\u2019ll give us another try and check out some other articles.
