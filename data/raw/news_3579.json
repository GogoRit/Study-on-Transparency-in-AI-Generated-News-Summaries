Walker, who has called for a national ban on abortions, called his ex-girlfriend\u2019s claim a \u201cflat-out lie,\u201d even though she provided both a receipt from the clinic and a personal check that Walker issued to her. Meanwhile, Walker\u2019s son, Christian Walker, denounced his father in two viral video rants. The Senate race in Georgia\u2014between Walker and the incumbent, Raphael Warnock\u2014is widely seen as one of the most important in the midterms, and in the aftermath of the allegations the Republican Party stood by its candidate. The New Yorker staff writer Charles Bethea joins the guest host Tyler Foggatt to discuss the scandal, the state of the race, and what it could mean for the balance of power in Washington.New Yorker FavoritesThe repressive, authoritarian soul of \u201cThomas the Tank Engine.\u201d\u00a0Why the last snow on Earth may be red.Harper Lee\u2019s abandoned true-crime novel.How the super-rich are preparing for doomsday.What if a pill could give you all the benefits of a workout?A photographer\u2019s college classmates, back then and now.Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.More:PodcastsPoliticsGeorgia2022 Midterm ElectionsRepublicans, Republican PartyRepublicans (G.O.P.)DailyOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top stories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.E-mail addressSign upBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.
