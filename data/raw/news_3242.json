Wade, which has led more than a dozen states to all but ban abortions. \u201cShock,\u201d \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d were some of the words that the participants in one of our latest focus groups used to describe the Supreme Court decision.\r\n\n\r\n\tBut this cohort, which spoke to us last week from around the country, also shared many nuanced insights that went beyond disappointment with the conservatives on the court. (We conducted a similar conversation the same evening with people who identified as pro-life.) Participants said they blamed liberals, including President Barack Obama and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for the state of American abortion rights, and some expressed a preference for policies that place limits on abortion access.\r\n\n\r\n\tWe wanted to understand the degree to which widespread misinformation about later abortions and abortion safety \u2014 and a seeming lack of awareness of abortion pills \u2014 had affected this group. Several participants overestimated the percentage of abortions that take place after the first trimester (fewer than 10 percent). Most vastly overestimated the major complication rate for abortion (less than a quarter of 1 percent) and believed incorrectly that abortion is more dangerous than childbirth. Few participants were familiar with abortion pills, which accounted for more than half of recent abortions performed in the United States and which many women, even in conservative states, are expected to use post-Roe.\r\n\n\r\n\tThe conversation ended by looking to the future. \u201cAre we still going to be having this debate 50 years from now?\u201d our moderator asked. Some participants expressed hope that the issue would be settled by then. But one man offered a sober prediction that reflected another theme from the evening: \u201cThe country is too divided to ever come together on something like this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\tIn both focus groups, participants used the phrases \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-choice\u201d to describe themselves as well as others, and to describe viewpoints; these edited versions retain that language to reflect how the participants spoke about these issues.\r\n\n\n\r\n  Lauren Kelley and Adrian J.

Even though I don\u2019t think I could get one, I don\u2019t know if I want to impose that on everyone else. I do think it\u2019s murder. If you\u2019re going to get an abortion, own it. You are murdering a baby.

I think that Roe protected women\u2019s bodily autonomy. So I think it\u2019s more about controlling and subjugating women than about abortion itself, and that\u2019s just what I think. Personally, I would never have an abortion. I just couldn\u2019t do it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about abortion. I think it\u2019s about a whole other thing and that the political sides are just using abortion as an excuse.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Michael J.,\r\n            \n\r\n              58, New York, Black, Democrat, office manager\r\n            \n\n\r\n          I\u2019m firmly on the side of women\u2019s right to choose. I look at the situation, and the people that are making these decisions are usually men.

If the mom really wants an abortion, she\u2019s going to get one. And it\u2019s better, I think, if it\u2019s legal so that she can go get one safely. The danger for the baby is \u2014 I\u2019ve had eight children grow inside of me. And feel love already on the inside. And if the mom hates that baby and she has to carry that baby, I think it messes up. I think it\u2019s dangerous. I think it\u2019s dangerous for the baby to be born like that.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Lauren Kelley\r\n            \n\n\r\n          So I\u2019m curious who you all think is to blame for the decision that came down overturning Roe v.

But because they did not think it was something that needed to be done, it didn\u2019t get done\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Bridget,\r\n            \n\r\n              54, Missouri, white, Republican, babysitting\r\n            \n\n\r\n          I have to say I think it falls squarely on Ruth Ginsburg. I think she was power hungry. She didn\u2019t retire under Obama, where he could have appointed a new justice. And so Trump got that opportunity because she waited till she died. So greed is really what caused it to tip to that way.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Haresh,\r\n            \n\r\n              43, New York, Asian, Democrat, customer service representative\r\n            \n\n\r\n          I agree that this should have been taken care of earlier. And Obama had the power to do what he needed to do. But he didn\u2019t do it. And now I think Joe Biden comes across as very weak. He\u2019s very old and fragile when I see him on TV. And he just doesn\u2019t \u2014 he doesn\u2019t bring that young spirit to the presidential stage. So I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do.

But in Massachusetts, it\u2019s predominantly a blue state, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have much of an impact with how things play out.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Lauren Kelley\r\n            \n\n\r\n          What will be on your mind as you\u2019re going to cast your votes?

Again, my belief, I wouldn\u2019t have an abortion. But by the same token, I\u2019m not one to be telling somebody what to do with their body. If they have an issue or they have a medical condition or they were a victim of rape or incest, I definitely would not be against that individual choosing to terminate a pregnancy.\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Moderator, Margie Omero\r\n            \n\n\r\n          What is it that you want to hear Democrats say about abortion?\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Haresh,\r\n            \n\r\n              43, New York, Asian, Democrat, customer service representative\r\n            \n\n\r\n          That we will help people who want to get an abortion.

Ms. Omero does similar work for political candidates, parties and special interest groups. She chose the participants. (Times Opinion paid her for the work.) The participants identified themselves as pro-choice, and that term is reflected in the article and group discussion. The same numbers of people were chosen to participate in this focus group and a companion focus group of abortion rights opponents; in the end, 10 participants chose to show up for this group, and 12 for the companion group. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity; an audio recording of the session is also included. Participants provided their biographical details. As is customary in focus groups, our role as moderators was not to argue with or fact-check the speakers, and some participants expressed opinions not rooted in facts.Illustrations by Lucinda Rogers.5Share full articleAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation\u00a9\u00a02024\u00a0The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
