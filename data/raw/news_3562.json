Here\u2019s what she said on the show, and why the Pro-Life Generation needs to be diligent in pointing out such inhumanity:\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring one of the latest segments of The View, co-host Joy Behar brought up an earlier social media post that Hathaway had made on Instagram which strangely tied a movie anniversary to the violence of abortion \u2014 and when explaining the post, Hathaway stated:\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMy own personal experience with abortion and I don\u2019t think we talk about this enough, abortion can be another word for mercy. We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. We know that no two pregnancies are alike, and it follows that no two lives are alike, it follows that no two conceptions are alike. So how can we have a law, how can we have a point of view on this that says we must treat everything the same?\u201d\u00a0\nShe continued, adding further clarification about the movie anniversary:\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the fight every day. We\u2019re in the fight every minute. And you mentioned \u2018The Devil Wears Prada\u2019 turning sweet 16.\u00a0 Some 16-year-old\u2019s life has been irrevocably changed because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHathaway\u2019s perspective is rather narrowminded \u2014 why is change bad? What about the preborn child\u2019s life that has been irrevocably changed because it has been saved through the reversal of Roe and subsequent state pro-life laws? That\u2019s a beautiful change. Why is the change of becoming a mother seen as the highway to hell? That\u2019s also a beautiful change; motherhood is a wonderful thing \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t mean that ambitions have to go away, although Hathaway seems to hold this view.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce again going back to \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d Hathaway said: \u201cI played a young woman who was starting out her career. And when you are a young woman starting out your career, your reproductive destiny matters a great deal.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that Hathaway chose to use her character, Andrea Sachs, from \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d as a role model for women \u2014 arguably, Sachs had a pretty miserable existence with her career, but a child isn\u2019t a death sentence for the working woman. If Hathaway wanted to hold out one of her movie characters as an example, however, she may have looked to the part she played in \u201cLes Miserables\u201d as Fantine, a dedicated mother. That is a woman and a level of love to aspire to.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnfortunately, the abortion lobby is full of celebrities (Harry Styles, Jennifer Lawrence, Halsey, Lizzo, et.) who use their platforms to promote this violence against the preborn, spreading the wrongful message that killing someone can be merciful. It is our duty to speak up when such outrageous claims are made and remind our culture that killing innocents is a sign of a depraved society.\u00a0\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: The Kardashian of the Abortion Industry\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Post Views: 2,981\n\nShare this postCaroline WhartonPress Specialist & Staff Writer\nCaroline Wharton is a graduate of the University of North Carolina who serves the Pro-Life Generation as a staff writer and communications assistant.BlogBlogrollcollegeFeaturedhigh schoolMed & LawMiddle SchoolUncategorizedSearchSubmitClearRecent PostsComing to a Campus Near You:\u00a0Kristan Hawkins Launches \u201cNo Abortion, No Exceptions\u201d\u00a0Spring 2024 Campus\u00a0Speaking\u00a0Tour\u00a0\u00a019 Mar 2024USD College Republicans SUSPEND SFLA Affiliation, Kicks Out Pro-Life President\u00a019 Mar 2024Students for Life Action:\u00a0\u201cMr. President, Please Don\u2019t Endorse a Bridge to Nowhere \u2013 Federal Support for more than 9 in 10 abortions with a limit at 4 Months (16 weeks) of Pregnancy.\u201d18 Mar 2024Man Convicted of the FACE Act for Sitting in Front of Planned Parenthood Entrance\u00a015 Mar 2024CategoriesAbortion DeathaboutAdverse DiagnosisBlogBlogrollClosing Abortion FacilitiescollegeCollege StudentsCommentaryConferencesConscience RightsEnd Student AbortionsEventsFall Med TourFeaturedFree-Speechhigh schoolHigh School StudentsHomeIn the Newslaw studentsLawsLeadersleadershipMed & LawMed StudentsMiddle SchoolMust ReadsNewsPlanned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood Educationpro-lifeProLife LawsReducing Planned Parenthood's InfluenceSFLA in the NewsSFLA Press FeatureSpring TourStem Cell ResearchStudents for Life ActionSubsitesSupportersSupreme CourtUncategorizedVirtual Media PackageWrongful Death \n\n1000 Winchester Street, Suite 301Fredericksburg, VA\u00a0 22401(540) 834-4600No Pro-Life Student Stands Alone.TEXT \"LIFE\" TO 53445 TO STAY CONNECTED!
