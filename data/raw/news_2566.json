At just 22 years old, she revived the 40 Days for Life Halifax campaign, a peaceful prayer vigil for an end to abortion.\u00a0\n\nThis 40 Days for Life Halifax campaign drew calls for a province-wide bubble zone law, which would prohibit any type of pro-life witness outside of hospitals and other abortion facilities. In December, Ruth Robert and CLC's David Cooke delivered our petition\u00a0urging Ministers Mark Furey and Randy Delorey to reject any attempt to establish bubble zones.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, NDP MLA Claudia Chender introduced bubble zone legislation -\u00a0 Bill 242 \"An Act to Protect Access to Reproductive Health Care\" - on Monday, March 2nd. Its second reading was on Wednesday, March 4th.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is what Ruth had to say about bubble zones:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI grew up in Saudi Arabia. It is a state where the government spies on its citizens. Freedom of expression, assembly, and religion are non-existent. Difference in ideology is not exactly allowed. Public decapitations are held on Fridays.\u00a0\n\r\nWhen I returned to Canada, it was nice to see a justice system that took pains to establish innocent or guilty and only punish the latter, where the dignity of an individual was recognized. I felt abortion was a blot on that, but otherwise, well done Canada on that front. In principle, at least, no one is arrested on a whim never to be seen again over a disagreement in philosophy. Law enforcement is to be held accountable.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI could not be more dismayed at the idea of bubble zones. Any kind of behaviour that would harm women entering a hospital is already illegal. This bill only serves to silence opposition, and further tell people they cannot gather and/or pray where they like in public space. It violates due process by punishing people for crimes they have not committed, and likely will never commit. You cannot speak about abortion in an access zone because someone might find it uncomfortable. That\u2019s a crime? Where do you draw the line? It is blatantly unconstitutional.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis bill also forbids filming by anyone in an access zone that is not associated with the abortion industry, despite it being public property. It even allows for police to arrest without warrant. It sounds like the beginnings of a police state where information and so-called evidence lies in the hands of one party, and the opposition is arrested on the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d of the popular party. How much longer until we reach public beheadings?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCanada, please wake up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRuth and others also spoke in front of the Committee on Law Amendments on Friday, March 6th. \n\u00a0\n\n\n>\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf you are in Nova Scotia, please contact your MLA and ask him/her to vote against this bill, and regardless of where you live, please share Ruth's testimony far and wide.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated 'Youth Blog' Pages\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[PF_SubMenu]\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\nContact\n\nNational Headquarters & Provincial OfficesOttawa Bureau\n\n\n\nResources\n\nGet InvolvedPress RoomStorePastors CornerElectionsRole of GovernmentPolicy & LegislationPetitionPregnancy HelpAbout UsAdopt Your MP\n\n\n\nFundraisers\n\nDonate\nReal Estate For Life\nProducts\nCoins for Life\nChristmas Cakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nNational Headquarters & Provincial OfficesOttawa Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Resources\n\nGet InvolvedPress RoomStorePastors CornerElectionsRole of GovernmentPolicy & LegislationPetitionPregnancy HelpAbout UsAdopt Your MP\n\n\n\nFundraise For CLC\n\nDonate\nReal Estate For Life\nProducts\nCoins for Life\nChristmas Cakes\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Campaign Life Coalition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
