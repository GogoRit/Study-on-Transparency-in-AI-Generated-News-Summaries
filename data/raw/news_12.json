In previous rulings, the New Orleans-based appeals court has allowed pill-induced abortions to proceed, as well as abortions for women nearing the legal limit to have one in Texas, which is 22 weeks after the last menstrual period.\nMedication-induced abortions can be performed in Texas through the 10th week of pregnancy. It was not immediately clear how the court\u2019s ruling will apply after Tuesday, when a strict bar on nonessential surgeries in Texas will be relaxed.\nIn March, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott barred all procedures not \u201cimmediately medically necessary,\u201d and the state\u2019s attorney general declared the restriction applied to abortions \u2014 sparking a weekslong court fight and prompting some women to seek abortions out of state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appeals court has largely upheld the restrictions. But U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel has sided with abortion providers and said the state\u2019s order \u201cprevents Texas women from exercising what the Supreme Court has declared is their fundamental constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is viable.\u201d\nAbbott recently said the bar on elective procedures would be eased starting Tuesday night for facilities that will reserve a quarter of their hospital capacity for coronavirus patients and will not request scarce protective equipment from the government. But Abbott punted to the courts on the question of whether abortions could resume, saying the issue was \u201cnot part of this order.\u201d\nIn a legal filing Saturday, abortion providers said they meet the criteria Abbott laid out. They have accused Republican state officials of political opportunism and said abortions rarely result in hospitalization and require little or no protective equipment.\nThe state, represented by Attorney General Ken Paxton, has said medication abortions may require personal protective equipment during initial doctors\u2019 visits and in the small percentage of cases that result in trips to the emergency room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTexas has a significant interest in preserving the health, welfare, and safety of its citizens, and [Abbott\u2019s executive order] is a measure designed to do just that,\u201d the state\u2019s latest filing says. \u201cThe harm caused by allowing certain elective abortions to go forward \u2014 potentially using up [personal protective equipment] and hospital beds while further spreading the disease \u2014 cannot be remedied.\u201d\nThe court fight is ongoing.\nOn Friday, 10 Democratic members of Texas\u2019 congressional delegation called on Paxton to \u201cstop treating abortion differently under Governor Abbott\u2019s order\u201d and to instead let doctors make \u201cmedical decisions about essential health care during this unprecedented global health pandemic.\u201d\nAbortion providers filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court during the legal wrangling but withdrew their request after the 5th Circuit judges allowed medication abortions to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    Texans need truth.
