Wade, warning that Republicans\u2019 ultimate goal is to outlaw abortion nationwide.The committee is sponsoring an at least $10,000 ad buy beginning Tuesday on the websites of more than 20 lifestyle publications, including Teen Vogue, Refinery29, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Essence, GQ, Men\u2019s Health and Esquire. The ads feature a picture of Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell alongside pink, white and blue text that says: \u201cRepublicans are pushing to ban abortion nationally. Join us in fighting back.\u201dThe cost is modest for a national campaign \u2014 especially when activists have accused President Joe Biden and other top Democrats of failing to respond forcefully enough to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Still, Democrats are betting outrage over the high court\u2019s action can fire up their base ahead of the midterm elections, while inflation is at record highs and Biden\u2019s approval ratings sag.\n\nThe DNC says it also plans to launch a separate, six-figure television ad campaign encouraging activism to defend abortion rights later this week across a dozen media markets in battleground areas.\nMany top Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to lean into the fight against abortion rights, seeing the overturning of Roe as a promise they kept to voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court nullified Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized the right to an abortion, in a ruling June 24, many Republican-led states have rushed to enact broad restrictions on the procedure. No federal legislation outlawing it exists, and getting such a bill through Congress would likely be difficult \u2014 but McConnell suggested even before the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that a future nationwide ban was \u201cpossible.\u201dFormer Vice President Mike Pence said after the ruling that \u201cwe must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land.\u201d\n\nThe DNC\u2019s digital ads are promoting what it is calling a \u201cweek of action\u201d devoted to defending abortion rights. \u201cWith this Defend Choice Week of Action, we\u2019re giving people across the country a chance to turn their anger into action by holding anti-choice Republicans accountable and helping to elect Democrats,\u201d DNC chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement.The digital ads, and the television campaign beginning later this week, are also helping publicize DefendChoice.org, a website the various Democratic campaign arms created after the Supreme Court ruling. The DNC says the site connects grassroots activists with the party\u2019s existing national infrastructure, and it notes that its volunteers made 23,000-plus calls in the weekend following the ruling \u2014 its most active weekend since last November\u2019s election. The committee says even before the ruling, it held briefings for state parties, elected officials and campaign staff to share research and messaging ideas compiled on the national level.\n\nTuesday\u2019s digital ad buy and the upcoming TV buy follow a five-figure digital campaign launched June 29 in which the DNC proclaimed that Republicans \u201cwant to go further and ban abortion. Believe them.\u201d___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of abortion at https://apnews.com/hub/abortion.___This story has been corrected to show the DNC chair\u2019s first name is Jaime, not Jamie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will Weissert\n            \n\n                Will is a national political reporter based in Washington.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
