Patients and physicians need assurances that they won\u2019t be accused of crimes for medically necessary treatment. Unfortunately, this is the post-Dobbs world we now face. The fact that medically necessary treatment can be criminalized speaks volumes about these misguided abortion laws. Physicians and other health care professionals must attempt to comply with vague, restrictive, complex, and conflicting state laws that interfere in the practice of medicine. These new policies will help the AMA to continue our advocacy and defend physicians in legislatures and the courts.\u201d\nThe policies adopted by the House of Delegates include:\nOpposing criminalization for pregnancy loss resulting from medically necessary care\nThe AMA will oppose criminal charges against patients or physicians when pregnancy loss results from medically necessary treatment for cancer and other illnesses. The AMA also will advocate that physicians and patients should not be held civilly or criminally liable in cases when pregnancy loss results from medically necessary care.\nRecent changes in abortion laws have sown confusion that has prompted insurance providers, pharmacies, and medical offices to restrict the use of medically necessary treatments -- even in states where abortion is legal. Pharmacists have resisted filling needed medications on the basis that they could be used off-label for pregnancy termination, and they could face criminal charges. Pregnant patients have faced criminal prosecution in the face of medically necessary care.\nAMA clarifies ethical guidance regarding abortion bans\nThe AMA\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics have long acknowledged that when the letter of the law would foreclose urgently needed care, physicians must have latitude to act in accord with their best professional judgment.\u00a0The newly amended ethical guidance clarifies this principle in the context of abortion, expressly permitting physicians to perform abortions in keeping with good medical practice.\n\u201cCaught between good medicine and bad law, physicians struggle to meet their ethical duties to patients\u2019 health and well-being, while attempting to comply with reckless government interference in the practice of medicine that is dangerous to the health of our patients,\u201d Dr. Resneck said. \u201cUnder extraordinary circumstances, the ethical guidelines of the profession support physician conduct that sides with their patient\u2019s safety and health, acknowledging that this may conflict with legal constraints that limit access to abortion or reproductive care.\u201d\nToday\u2019s action clarifies AMA\u2019s ethical guidance on abortion and aligns with established AMA policies opposing government intrusion into patient-physician relationships as contrary to the appropriate exercise of professional judgment and physicians\u2019 fiduciary obligation to protect patients\u2019 well-being.\nPhysicians and medical students also directed the AMA to provide support, including legal support, as appropriate, and develop policies, strategies, and resources to assist physicians in navigating between ethical duties and legal requirements.\nExpanding support for access to abortion care\nTo ensure broad and equitable access to abortion services called for by newly adopted policy, the AMA will advocate for public health programs and private insurers to cover those services. The AMA also will urge lawmakers to codify legal protections for physicians who provide abortion services.\n\u201cReproductive care is health care. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Dr. Resneck said. \u201cExpecting patients, especially those covered by Medicaid, to shoulder the cost of abortion services is unrealistic. Our new policy is a roadmap for improving access and equity to ensure patients get the health care that they need.\u201d\nPreserving access to abortion training for physicians-in-training\nAlthough the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires access to abortion training for all obstetrics and gynecology residents, nearly 45% of accredited programs are in states that have or are likely to ban abortion. New policy directs the AMA to ensure medical students and residents retain access to abortion training. Specifically, the AMA will advocate for the availability of abortion education and clinical exposure to medication and procedural abortion. The AMA will also advocate for funding for institutions that provide clinical training on reproductive health services, including medication and procedural abortion, to medical students and resident and fellow physicians from other programs, so that they can expand their capacity to accept out-of-state physicians-in-training who are seeking this training.\nUnder the new policy, the AMA will support pathways for medical students, residents and fellow physicians to receive medication and procedural abortion training at another location in the event that this training is limited or illegal in a home institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n       \n          \n\n\n\n  Media Contact:\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\n\nAMA Media & Editorial\nph: (312) 464-4430\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the American Medical Association\nThe American Medical Association is the physicians\u2019 powerful ally in patient care. As the only medical association that convenes 190+ state and specialty medical societies and other critical stakeholders, the AMA represents physicians with a unified voice to all key players in health care. \u00a0The AMA leverages its strength by removing the obstacles that interfere with patient care, leading the charge to prevent chronic disease and confront public health crises and, driving the future of medicine to tackle the biggest challenges in health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterim Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates\n            \n\n\nAMA Policies\n            \n\n\nReproductive Health\n            \n\n\nWomen's Health\n            \n\n\nFederal Advocacy\n            \n\n\nState Advocacy\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembership Moves Medicine\u2122\n\n\n\nFree access to JAMA Network\u2122 and CME\nSave hundreds on insurance\nFight for physicians and patient rights\n\n\n\n\n    Join the AMA today\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    FEATURED STORIES\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Mar 9, 2024\n          \n\u00b7\n3 MIN READ\n\n\n\n\n      CMS to advance pay to doctors affected by disruptive cyberattack\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Mar 8, 2024\n          \n\u00b7\n5 MIN READ\n\n\n\n\n      9 states pass bills to fix prior authorization\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Mar 11, 2024\n          \n\u00b7\n4 MIN READ\n\n\n\n\n      Big party, or private affair?
