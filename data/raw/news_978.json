Greg Gianforte.\n\nMTN News\nMontana Attorney General Austin Knudsen.\n\n\u201c(Armstrong) basically said that right of privacy applies to the right to make decisions about (women\u2019s) health care and to see the health-care provider of their choice, particularly for abortion,\u201d Stahl told MTN News. \u201cOur argument is that all of those (new laws) restrict the ability of a patient to seek abortion care, pre-viability (of the fetus), from the provider of their choice.\u201dArmstrong, decided in October 1999, came in a lawsuit by Kalispell physician James Armstrong and his physician assistant colleague, Susan Cahill, challenging a 1995 law that said physician assistants could not perform abortions in Montana.Armstrong and Cahill, who\u2019d been performing abortions for many years, said the law was an unconstitutional infringement on women\u2019s right to choose their health-care provider for a legal procedure.The suit actually failed before the U.S. Supreme Court, but then reverted to state court, where a district judge and then a unanimous Montana Supreme Court ruled the law violated Montana\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to privacy.Then-Justice James Nelson wrote the lengthy decision. He told MTN News the 1995 law didn\u2019t rely on any medical evidence to restrict a patient\u2019s medical choice, but rather on \u201cpartisan ideology\u201d and religious beliefs opposing abortion.\n\nMTN News\nFormer Montana Supreme Court Justice James Nelson.\n\n\u201cI think the important thing is that the right of a woman to choose a pre-viability abortion is grounded in the right of individual privacy -- that the Constitutional Convention, the framers, considered probably one of the most important fundamental rights that they were providing,\u201d he said in an interview this week.Or, as he wrote in the 1999 decision: \u201cQuite simply, (the law) at issue prevents a woman from obtaining a lawful medical procedure \u2013 a pre-viability abortion \u2013 from a health-care provider of her choosing. In so doing, (this law) unconstitutionally infringes a woman\u2019s right to individual privacy under Montana\u2019s constitution.\u201dKnudsen, however, is arguing the privacy right not only doesn\u2019t create a right to abortion, but also does not erase all restrictions on abortion, placed by the Legislature.The laws in question outlaw abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, severely restrict access to abortion pills, require doctors to ask abortion patients if they want to see an ultrasound of the fetus, and ban abortion insurance coverage in publicly subsidized health plans.Knudsen says nothing in the state constitution prevents the Legislature from creating these regulatory restrictions.Knudsen also called the Armstrong decision \u201cunrestrained judicial activism,\u201d that creates a right \u201carising from the sociological conviction of seven judges.\u201dNelson firmly rejects that claim, saying anyone who reads the court\u2019s 1999 ruling can see it\u2019s \u201cgrounded in a very strong, thorough analysis of Montana\u2019s constitutional right of privacy.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the court\u2019s (religious) beliefs that dictated that decision,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was dictated by the court\u2019s legal analysis overcoming the Legislature\u2019s decision to intervene on the basis of religious beliefs and partisan ideology.\u201dNelson also agrees with Stahl that because these abortion protections in Montana \u201care totally grounded in Montana constitutional law,\u201d they likely aren\u2019t subject to change because of federal court rulings that could allow more abortion restrictions.\n\nMTN News\nState Assistant Solicitor General Katie Smithgall.\n\nWhen asked if a decision on the Montana laws could fall under jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the state\u2019s top attorneys on the case said the claims raised by Planned Parenthood are based only on the state constitution.\u201cRight now, this focuses on state issues,\u201d said state Assistant Solicitor General Katie Smithgall. \u201cThis case is truly a case for the Montana court system. \u2026 At this point, the focus is clearly on the constitutional claims raised by the plaintiffs and these laws enacted by the Legislature.\u201d\n\n\nCopyright 2022 Scripps Media, Inc.
