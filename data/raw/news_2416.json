Jones also supports that proposal, having voted for it on Feb. 25, 2019.The group says Tuberville opposes using tax dollars to pay for abortion and opposes taxpayer funding of abortion providers.\u201cTommy Tuberville will vote to confirm conservative federal judges to the bench who pledge to interpret the Constitution as it was written,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy contrast, his opponent, Senator Doug Jones, supports a policy of abortion on demand, which allows abortion for any reason, and he supports taxpayer funding for abortion.\u201dThe group also noted that Jones voted against the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201cTommy Tuberville will work to ensure all innocent human life is protected and he is committed to strengthening a culture of life throughout the nation and in the U.S. Senate,\u201d said Tobias. \u201cAs a coach, Tommy Tuberville knows the hard work that goes into achieving victory and we look forward to working with him to win greater protections for the most vulnerable in our society.\u201dPlanned Parenthood will offer abortion at new Birmingham clinicPlanned Parenthood Southeast has opened its downtown Birmingham clinic, at 1019 First Ave. North.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
