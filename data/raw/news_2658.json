Oh, yes. Baby Yoda has finally done something \u201csinister\u201d to break the spell he cast over fans of\u00a0The Mandalorian.\u00a0\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the show,\u00a0The Mandalorian\u00a0is a Star Wars spinoff in which a bounty hunter who is originally tasked with capturing and collecting a reward for Baby Yoda finds he has an affection for the small creature. Most fans of the show have more or less confessed they\u2019d give their life for this adorable fictional character, but the affection was quickly tossed aside after last week\u2019s episode,\u00a0The Passenger.\u00a0\nIn the episode, a \u201cFrog Lady\u201d is the last of her species and is being escorted by the Mandalorian with a canister of her eggs which are the last hope of keeping her species alive. Baby Yoda, who has all of the cute and comedic qualities of a child throughout the series, is seen innocently (given that he doesn\u2019t know his wrongdoing) snacking on the eggs periodically. Then the internet blew up.\n\n\u201cHow could Baby Yoda be part of such a cruel joke!?\u201d, Twitter warriors cried. In fairness, most of the outraged fans seem more angry on behalf of the Frog Lady and her species than anything else. The fact that they seem legitimately angry about making light of \u201cgenocide,\u201d however, gets into the absurd. And not just because this is a fantasy show about aliens.\nWe are looking at a group of people who are horrified about a lovable little alien eating alien eggs\u2026 yet have no problem with real-life human beings killing our own fertilized offspring in abortions. Say, for a moment, that The Mandalorian\u00a0was not fiction. Baby Yoda wasn\u2019t eating children; he was eating unfertilized eggs, which are only half of what\u2019s needed to create a living organism (evidently, both in Star Wars and in real life). A Lucasfilm executive even pointed this out himself. To call it \u201cgenocide\u201d suggests that he was killing living, whole, unique \u201cFrog Lady\u201d offspring.\nThough an offshoot given its fantastical nature, this issue is reminiscent of something we see all the time in the pro-life movement. Many members of the Students for Life team have conversed with abortion supporters who bluntly suggest, \u201cIf I scratch skin cells off the back of my hand, am I committing genocide?\u201d or \u201cAre blow jobs cannibalism, then?\u201d It\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of the biology behind when life begins.\nA Science Lesson\nEgg and sperm are haploid cells. They are half of what\u2019s needed to reproduce. On their own, they are cells in an adult body. But when they join, a new organism is created. This new organism is whole (everything about it comes together immediately, i.e. DNA), unique (no others like it have ever existed or will ever exist again), living (it is developing & growing from the first moment), and self-directed (the mother\u2019s body is not telling it what to do, but rather providing nourishment and an environment in which the new organism does its independent growing).\nLearn more about where babies come from here.\nKilling eggs or sperm isn\u2019t ending human life. Killing it anytime after fertilization does end a human life. Everything that makes us human is present from the very beginning. The only thing we ALL have in common is our biological humanity. Maybe we should spend a little less time worrying about what Baby Yoda is up to and a little more time learning about what\u2019s happening to our own species every day.\n\n Post Views: 1,684\n\nShare this postBrenna Lewis\nServing as President of her Students for Life group in college, Brenna is now Students for Life\u2019s Digital Content Manager.
