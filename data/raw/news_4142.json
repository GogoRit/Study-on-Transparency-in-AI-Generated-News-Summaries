Joe Biden is the only candidate in this race who will stand up for our health and our rights.\u201d\nWASHINGTON, DC - Today, Planned Parenthood Action Fund announced its endorsement of Vice President Joe Biden for president of the United States.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view the Planned Parenthood Action Fund endorsement video click HERE\nStatement from Alexis McGill Johnson, Acting President, Planned Parenthood Action Fund:\n\n\n\u201cThis election is a fight for our country\u2019s very survival. We have seen the Trump administration dehumanize us, and disregard our health, our rights, and our lives. Trump has attacked access to abortion and reproductive health care, and he has attacked the people that Planned Parenthood health centers serve: women, Black people, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community and more.\u00a0\n\u201cJoe Biden is the only candidate in this race who will stand up for our health and our rights. He was instrumental in the creation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded birth control with no co-pay to 63 million women, and in helping to ensure that sexual and reproductive health care was accessible across the country. He has spoken out for LGBTQ+ rights, and against the systemic racism in this country that is costing Black people their lives. Biden has committed to champion access to sexual and reproductive health care \u2014 including access to abortion \u2014\u00a0and to fight for our communities. When he left the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden had a 100% voting record from Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and has been clear he is \u2018100% for sexual and reproductive health.\u2019 And we are going to hold him to that.\n\u201cDonald Trump is dangerous. We must do everything we can to get him out of office this November.\u00a0\n\"This election we have a choice \u2014 between Donald Trump, whose incompetence and disregard for the law are a danger to us all, and Joe Biden, who is committed to fighting for reproductive health and rights for all.\n\u201cFor us, and for so many, the choice is clear. Planned Parenthood Action Fund is endorsing Joe Biden for president.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Vice President, Biden was instrumental in the creation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded birth control with no co-pay to 63 million women, eliminated gender bias in health insurance and helped to ensure that sexual and reproductive health care was accessible across the country. As a candidate, Biden has outlined a range of policies to protect and expand access to reproductive health care, including abortion, including:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nexpanding access to contraception \u2014\u00a0outlining a plan to expand the ACA and guarantee access to birth control with no co-pays, including in his proposed public option;\n\n\nprotecting the constitutional right to an abortion, including with his judicial nominations, and reversing the Trump Administration and some states\u2019 all-out assault on the right to access abortion;\u00a0\n\n\nsupport for comprehensive sex education;\u00a0\n\n\nreversing Trump\u2019s harmful Title X gag rule \u2014 which forced Planned Parenthood affiliates and other health centers out of the nation\u2019s only dedicated family planning program \u2014 and his dangerous global gag rule, which undermines access to sexual and reproductive health services around the world;\u00a0\n\n\naddressing the high maternal mortality rate among Black women.\u00a0\n\n\nVice President Biden has also publicly committed multiple times \u2014 including at Planned Parenthood Action Fund\u2019s We Decide member forum last June, and more recently in the Democratic presidential debate this past March \u2014\u00a0to repeal the harmful Hyde Amendment. Biden is also the only candidate in the presidential race to address racial injustice and structural racism in this country \u2014\u00a0calling directly for this country to dismantle the systemic racism that has proven to be deadly for so many Black people across America.\u00a0\nIn contrast, Donald Trump has spent the past four years pushing policies and actions that threaten access to reproductive health care and rights. Tens of thousands of people have died following his incompetence in handling the response to COVID-19. He has spent his time in office dismantling access to health care \u2014\u00a0slashing the safety net, trying to block access to abortion, fighting at the Supreme Court to restrict access to birth control, remaking the federal courts with judges hostile to the right to access sexual and reproductive health care, and trying to keep patients from accessing care at Planned Parenthood health centers. And it\u2019s not just health care \u2014\u00a0he has attacked the rights and well-being of countless communities across the country \u2014\u00a0immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community and more.\u00a0\nThis announcement is part of the Action Fund\u2019s continued endorsement of federal candidates committed to reproductive health and rights around the country. In 2018, the American people sent more women and women of color to Congress than ever before and flipped the House of Representatives to a clear pro-reproductive health majority.\nLast year, Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations announced a historic investment of at least $45 million in key battleground states during the 2020 cycle, and in January, Planned Parenthood Votes launched \u201cWe Decide 2020,\u201d Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations\u2019 people-powered electoral program to elect champions for reproductive rights up and down the ballot in 2020. Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations around the country will be mobilizing 15 million Planned Parenthood supporters to help people get involved and build on their power for the upcoming election. Planned Parenthood Action Fund also plans to mobilize over half a million Action Fund members this election to volunteer for and elect our endorsed candidates \u2014including Vice President Joe Biden.\n\u201cWe Decide 2020\u201d will be Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations\u2019 largest electoral program ever.\u00a0\nFind Planned Parenthood Action Fund\u2019s presidential candidate spotlight here.\u00a0\n###\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund is an independent, nonpartisan, not-for-profit membership organization formed as the advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
