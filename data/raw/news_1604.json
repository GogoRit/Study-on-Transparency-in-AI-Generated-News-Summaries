On 25 August 2022, 18 months after Zahedi-Spung landed a dream job as a maternal fetal medicine specialist, the state enacted one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, one that does not even make explicit exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person.Tennessee\u2019s ban makes performing or attempting to perform an abortion a Class C felony \u2013 meaning Zahedi-Spung could have faced a 15-year-prison sentence for providing life-saving care. So, in January 2023, she decided to leave for work in Colorado, where abortion is still legal in all stages of pregnancy.At the end of 2022, she started writing a diary for the Guardian, detailing her last days in a busy doctor\u2019s office where she sometimes saw more than 40 patients a day, many begging her for help she could not give. The diary has been supplemented with interviews, to try and capture what life is like for a doctor whose work is severely restricted due to a total abortion ban.30 November 2022 \u2013 \u2018utter and complete chaos\u2019View image in fullscreenThis patient knew around 15 weeks that her pregnancy was going to be unviable, but in the confusion that followed the overturning of Roe v Wade last June, she struggled to make a decision about whether to leave the state for care or to wait it out. \u201cIt was such utter and complete chaos that she just couldn\u2019t figure out what to do,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. As her doctor, Zahedi-Spung worried the longer the pregnancy went on, the harder it would be for her patient to let go. Eventually, they made plans to go ahead with the birth in Tennessee, through cesarian section.Zahedi-Spung and I discuss what happened with that patient in a phone call. \u201cShe carried to term and got delivered on Friday [9 December], and her baby died within a couple of minutes after delivery. But she got some time with her and that\u2019s what she wanted,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung.Another patient came to see Zahedi-Spung alone on 30 November, having carried a pregnancy she had long warned was at high risk of being unsuccessful. The patient had been hopeful, although she was aware of a fetal anomaly. At 36 weeks, Zahedi-Spung diagnosed a stillbirth.\u201cI had to tell her that her baby\u2019s dead. I mean, it\u2019s just it\u2019s awful every time. But it\u2019s really awful when they\u2019re alone,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung, reflecting on the case.Later on 30 November \u2013 no heartbeat detectedView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen\u2018It was such utter and complete chaos that she just couldn\u2019t figure out what to do.\u2019 Illustration: Avery Williamson/The GuardianUnder these circumstances, Zahedi-Spung was allowed to intervene with a dilation and evacuation procedure, without having to send this patient out of state.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have a heartbeat, it\u2019s not considered an abortion,\u201d explains Zahedi-Spung.1 December 2022 \u2013 patient transferred out of stateView image in fullscreenWith this patient, Zahedi-Spung saw someone whose pregnancy had implanted in the scar of her uterus, a life threatening condition that can lead to a catastrophic uterine rupture. In other cases, it may result in the placenta eating through the wall of the uterus, the bladder and sometimes the bowel. Still, the Tennessee ban does not permit an abortion for such cases.Zahedi-Spung sent the couple to Georgia, where abortion laws are stringent, but include exceptions for maternal life and ectopic pregnancies.\u201cI sent her to one of my mentors, so I knew she was going to get exactly the care she needed,\u201d Zahedi-Spung says.6 December 2022 \u2013 \u2018I feel like a shell of myself\u2019View image in fullscreenUp until this point, everything had been developing normally for the  patient Zahedi-Spung saw on 8 December, as is often the case: most anomalies are not picked up before 16 weeks. The patient was happy and excited about their pregnancy. When they heard the pregnancy was nonviable, they were devastated.Their options were limited. In terms of states nearby they could travel to, many were blocked off: Georgia had a six-week ban in operation, and nearby Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi all had total bans. North Carolina was the closest state the couple would be able to receive abortion care at this stage of pregnancy.Zahedi-Spung worried about sending them to North Carolina. \u201c[I was sending them] to an abortion clinic \u2026 which comes with its own burden of having to walk past protesters who are like, \u2018you\u2019re gonna kill your baby!\u2019 and it\u2019s just awful for them. It\u2019s awful for anybody, but it\u2019s really awful for my patients who have lethal anomalies when it was a really wanted pregnancy,\u201d she says.While writing this diary, Zahedi-Spung was in the process of moving for a new job in Colorado. We caught up by phone in the middle of the day on a Friday, after she had just put her child down for nap time. She was quite sleepy herself, noticeable from her tone \u2013 she sounded relaxed but depleted.\u201cI\u2019m exhausted by everything. I feel a little bit like a shell of myself at times,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. To cope with the stress, she says: \u201cI tend to retreat inward. I describe myself as having a box [in my mind] that I put all this bad stuff in. And I shut it in very tight and I stick it on a shelf.\u201d20 December 2022 \u2013 \u2018Thankfully she didn\u2019t bleed to death\u2019 View image in fullscreenThis patient came in around 16 weeks pregnant, having felt a gush of fluid from what\u2019s called a preterm premature rupture of membranes. Her water had broken early. She was with her partner and her mom, having had a totally normal pregnancy up until that point. She was in an incredible amount of pain, contracting every five minutes and crying. The amount of pain indicated she may go into labor soon, too early for the pregnancy to be viable. A heartbeat was still detectable on the ultrasound.\u201cI figured she\u2019d deliver at some point. But I didn\u2019t know when \u2013 and she was certainly not able to be discharged home given the amount of pain she was in. She was not infected; she certainly wasn\u2019t bleeding enough for me to justify doing anything. So we just had to wait, and I made her as comfortable as I could \u2013 we gave her an epidural,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung.Thankfully she didn\u2019t get sick and she didn\u2019t bleed to death. But why do I have to wait for that to take care of people?If there wasn\u2019t a total ban in place, Zahedi-Spung would have induced labor, or taken the patient to the operating room to perform a surgical abortion. But the rules said she couldn\u2019t.The patient delivered around 12 hours later, after Zahedi-Spung had gone home.\u201cTechnically we didn\u2019t break any standards of care, but the evidence-based guidelines are that if someone\u2019s water breaks prior to 22 weeks, you end the pregnancy. So I wasn\u2019t doing all that I could have done to protect the patient. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t get sick and she didn\u2019t bleed to death. But why do I have to wait for [that] to take care of people?\u201d asks Zahedi-Spung.The case made Zahedi-Spung angry. \u201cI have the ability to provide life-saving care. And I\u2019m being told I\u2019m not allowed to do that because it offends people. It\u2019s so ridiculous. None of these lawmakers even understand the grief that these patients are suffering,\u201d she said.22-26 December 2022 \u2013 An \u2018unexpected and terrible\u2019 discoveryView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenZahedi-Spung coordinated care in North Carolina for a couple that decided to travel out of state following the discovery of a lethal heart defect. Illustration: Avery Williamson/The GuardianZahedi-Spung saw this patient and her partner over four days around Christmas. The couple had just learned about a heart defect from their family doctor.\u201cThey were a very knowledgeable couple. This was an unexpected pregnancy, but a wanted one. And then this very unexpected and terrible finding of a heart defect showed up,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. Babies with this heart defect have a very small chance of surviving the first year of their life. \u201cThey were very thoughtful, as all of my families are, about what that would mean for their life and for their kiddo\u2019s life,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. They decided to end the pregnancy out of state.The heartbeat bears are a memento Zahedi-Spung offers to patients when a pregnancy won\u2019t be successful. A company sends a stuffed teddy and a recording device, and Zahedi-Spung records the heartbeat and puts the device inside bear. The families can squeeze it and hear the fetal heartbeat. \u201cIt can be very important to families,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. She learned about the practice during her residency training.2 January 2023 \u2013 the last dayView image in fullscreenThis was Zahedi-Spung\u2019s last day. She was getting ready to leave at the end of her shift to go to the airport with her family when she was told about an emergency patient who was seizing and pregnant, around 23 or 24 weeks. The patient was unable to breathe on her own and had to be intubated. Neither the patient, nor her partner or family, seemed to know she was pregnant. They were shocked when Zahedi-Spung informed them.\u201cThat was really difficult because it meant we couldn\u2019t have a conversation about what it [would mean for the patient\u2019s health] to be delivered at this time, what it means for the baby, or anything like that,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung.Zahedi-Spung delivered the baby alive, but is unsure whether it survived after she left. \u201cIt was very much on the edge,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. \u201cAnd she just woke up and found out about a baby she hadn\u2019t known about when she came in.\u201cIf there was no ban, I would have given her the option to have an abortion. She was so sick, the kid was going to be sick. She was going to be impacted for the rest of her life by the surgery I had to give her. I don\u2019t know if she would have said yes to that, but I would have liked to have given her the option. Her hands were tied,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung.Zahedi-Spung\u2019s last day at work in Tennessee was 1 January. To mark the occasion, a colleague took her out for dinner at a farm-to-table restaurant in Northshore, Chattanooga. They split the chicken, and drank martinis. \u201cShe was very sad that I was leaving. I was too. It\u2019s been bittersweet,\u201d says Zahedi-Spung. \u201cI never wanted to leave. I loved my job. It had just become impossible for me.\u201dHer new job started on 17 January. Before she began, she still felt conflicted over starting out again, in a state where abortion is legal.\u201cI\u2019ve only ever known how to take care of patients in a place where it\u2019s hard,\u201d she says. Being one of the only doctors that provided the care she did in Tennessee created a unique relationship. \u201cAll of the patients I have taken care of over the last year and a half have my cell phone number. And that creates a different kind of bond with people.\u201dAs she left Tennessee, she felt a nagging guilt.\u201cPart of me felt like I was selling out by coming here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of medicine. They teach us that we\u2019re not worthy, unless it is so hard. But I shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice so much of myself for it.\u201dExplore more on these topicsAbortionReproductive rightsRoe v WadeTennesseefeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
