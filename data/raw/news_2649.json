(Credit: Twitter/Victoria Morales Gorleri.)\nListenROSARIO, Argentina \u2013 Pope Francis got himself involved with the ongoing debate over the decriminalization of abortion in his Argentinian homeland, sending a handwritten letter to a group of women from Buenos Aires\u2019 slums asking, \u201cIs it fair to hire a hitman to resolve a problem?\u201d\nThe pope\u2019s handwritten letter is a direct response to mothers from some of the largest slums in his former archdiocese. The women sent him the letter last week, asking for him to be their voice in the debate over abortion currently taking place in Argentina.\n\nLast week, President Alberto Fernandez presented a bill to Argentina\u2019s Congress, calling on it to make abortion \u201clegal, safe and free\u201d across the nation.\nIf adopted, the legislation would allow girls as young as 13 to get an abortion without their parents\u2019 consent, abortion on demand would be legalized until the 14th week of the pregnancy, and a termination would be allowed at any point of a pregnancy if it was determined endanger the physical or psychological life of the mother or if it was the result of sexual abuse.\nFernandez has long argued that the legalization of abortion would be a solution for women who live in poverty and cannot afford to have a termination at a private clinic. This, they argue, would curb the number of deaths due to illegal abortion.\nNumbers from 2017 \u2013 the latest data available \u2013 show that around 40 women die annually in Argentina due to abortion, both natural and induced.\nEarlier this week, Fernandez had said that even though he\u2019s Catholic, he sees abortion as a matter of public health, adding that he hoped Pope Francis wouldn\u2019t become angry at him for his push to legalize it.\nIn his Nov. 22 letter, Francis argued that the issue of abortion \u201cis not primarily a religious matter but a matter of human ethics, preceding any religious confession.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s good for us to ask two questions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIs it fair to eliminate a human life to resolve a problem? Is it fair to hire a hitman to resolve a problem?\u201d\nThough Pope Francis has often spoken against abortion \u2013 even asking those two questions \u2013 this is the first time he has directly addresses the pro-abortion campaign in his home country.\nFrancis sent his response through Victoria Morales Gorleri \u2013 a member of the Argentine Congress who belongs to Pro, the major opposition party. She was also the intermediary for the women from the \u201cslums of misery,\u201d as shantytowns are called in Argentina.\n\u201cWe write to your Holiness, with the desire to ask for you to help us express to public opinion that we feel prisoners in a situation where our own family is compromised, as are our teenage daughters and future generations, that grow old with the idea that our life is not wanted and that we don\u2019t have a right to have children because we are poor,\u201d the women wrote on Nov. 18. (Bold and underline in the original.)\n\u201cWe ask for your help in making our voice heard, surely you will be listened to with more attention that that our politicians give us,\u201d they continued.\n\u201cOur voice, like that of unborn children, is never heard \u2026 They classified us as a \u2018factory of the poor\u2019 or \u2018workers of the State\u2019. Our reality as women who overcome life\u2019s challenges with our children is overshadowed by women who claim to represent us without us giving our consent, stifling our true positions on the right to life. They do not want to listen to us, neither the legislators nor the journalists. If we did not have the slum priests who raise their voices for us, we would be even more alone,\u201d the letter added.\nTheir letter was signed by eight women activists who met in 2018, when the legalization of abortion was being discussed by Argentina\u2019s Senate for the first time in 12 years. Since then, they\u2019ve opened three soup kitchens: \u201cNo one asked us to do this; we do it because we know that our contribution is important and because, though we don\u2019t have things to spare, what we have is shared and multiplied.\u201d\nIn his handwritten response, Francis thanked Morales Gorleri and the women for writing to him.\n\u201cThey truly are women who know what this life is. Please, tell them from my part that I admire their work and their witness; that I thank them from the heart what they do and to carry on,\u201d the pope wrote.\n\u201cThe homeland is proud of having women such as these,\u201d he continued.\nOn Saturday, leaders of Argentina\u2019s pro-life movement have called for a national rally \u2013 to be held in over 50 cities \u2013 \u00a0in support of what they call the \u201cdefense of both lives\u201d: The unborn baby and the mother.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are asked to hold processions inside their cars, or if they don\u2019t have access to a vehicle, by wearing a facemask and keeping a safe social distance.\nFollow In\u00e9s San Mart\u00edn on Twitter:\u00a0@inesanma\nShareLatest Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Related Stories\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Popular\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep Crux IndependentFor the cost of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can help keep the lights on at Crux.Support UsLast Week in the Church with John Allen Jr.Tuesdays onCrux.
