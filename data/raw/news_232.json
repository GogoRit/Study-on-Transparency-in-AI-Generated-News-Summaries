It is the most common type of second-trimester abortion.\u00a0\nAttorney General Daniel Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office took over the lawsuit from former Gov. Matt Bevin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office who signed the bill into law in 2018, his office argued in January that requiring this procedure would not ban second-trimester abortions in Kentucky rather make them more humane. The Court of Appeals however found the risk of undergoing a fetal demise, an untested medical procedure could put a woman seeking an abortion at additional harm.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll those required to undergo a fetal-demise procedure will be compelled to expose themselves to the negative consequences to their health, to invest additional time in the procedure, and to subject themselves to an additional invasive and potentially experimental procedure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the opinion from Judge Eric Clay read. \"Thus, the district court correctly found that 100% of the relevant population would be unduly burdened by this law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nEMW Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Surgical Center, the only abortion provider in Kentucky, does not provide fetal demise procedures at their clinic as they say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too risky of a procedure.\u00a0\nHowever, not all members on the panel agreed, Judge John K. Bush, dissented with the ruling. Judge Bush called into question why EMW Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Surgical Center would not train their doctors to administer the fetal demise shot to provide to women who want to have one and also called into question why a patient was not a party on the lawsuit, instead just the abortion facility representing patients as a whole.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering whether abortion providers have third-party standing to protect constitutional rights of potential patients on abortion laws, Bush questioned why the court made a ruling on the case before the Supreme Court rulings.\u00a0\n\"The majority\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to issue an opinion just before the Supreme Court potentially decides an outcome-determinative issue in our case seems to me an unwise use of judicial resources,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bush wrote in his opinion.\u00a0\nThe ACLU of Kentucky, who challenged the law in court, is celebrating the ruling.\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo courts have made it resoundingly clear that D&E abortion care is safe, and Kentuckians have a right to access this care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Heather Gatnarek, staff attorney with the ACLU of Kentucky in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Court of Appeals confirms what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been asserting for years: The Kentucky General Assembly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to ban D&E abortion care is unconstitutional because it imposes a substantial burden on the right to choose. Our clients are relieved they will be guided by medicine, not politicians when providing D&E care to their patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0\nAttorney General Daniel Cameron (R) says his office will continue to fight for the law.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disappointed with the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruling and will take any steps necessary to continue defending the law, which protects the unborn from a gruesome procedure,\" Cameron said in a statement.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Spectrum News\n        \n\n\n\n            CONTACT\n        \n\n\n\n            CAREERS\n        \n\n\n\n            ABOUT\n        \n\n\n\n            RSS\n        \n\n\n\n            FAQ\n        \n\n\n\n            SITEMAP\n        \n\n\n\n            ADVERTISE WITH US\n        \n\n\n\n            TERMS\n        \n\n\n\n            Your Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Privacy Rights\n        \n\n\n\n            California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information\n        \n\n\n\n            Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\n        \n\n\n\n            Spectrum News App\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
