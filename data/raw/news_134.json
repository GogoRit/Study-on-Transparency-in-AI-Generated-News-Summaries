Rolanda Hollis doubles down on mandatory vasectomy bill\n\nBy Sean Ross\nFebruary 14, 2020 \n\n\n\n\nShare\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Capitol Journal/Facebook, YHN)\nMONTGOMERY \u2014 State Rep. Rolanda Hollis (D-Birmingham) is doubling down after she made international waves Thursday in introducing a bill that would require every Alabama man to undergo a vasectomy within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.\nYellowhammer News first reported\u00a0on HB 238, which laments in the bill synopsis,\u00a0\u201cUnder existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men.\u201d\nHollis, in a tweet sharing Yellowhammer\u2019s original article on the legislation, confirmed HB 238 is indeed a reaction to pro-life legislation enacted last year, including the Human Life Protection Act.\n\n\n\u201cThe Vasectomy bill is to help with the reproductive system,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is to neutralize the abortion ban bill (Human Life Protection Act). The responsibility is not always on the women. It takes 2 to tangle [sic].\u201d\n\u201cThis will help prevent pregnancy as well as abortion of unwanted children,\u201d Hollis claimed. \u201cThis\u00a0bill is to help men become more accountable as well as women.\u201d\nIn an interview with WSFA on Friday, Hollis reportedly pushed back on the notion that HB 238 is \u201can outrageous overstep.\u201d She complained that \u201cyear after year the majority party continues to introduce new legislation that tries to dictate a woman\u2019s body and her reproductive rights,\u201d adding, \u201cmen should not be legislating what women do with their bodies.\u201d\nDuring the debate on the Human Life Protection Act in 2019, Hollis read from a poem \u201cIf My Vagina was a Gun,\u201d comparing the Second Amendment rights debate to the debate over a woman\u2019s right to an abortion.\nIn fact, debate on that bill last year in the upper chamber actually touched on vasectomy \u2014 just in a different way. State Sen. Vivian Davis-Figures (D-Mobile)\u00a0offered an amendment to criminalize any man who gets a vasectomy with a Class A felony. An attempted vasectomy would have been a Class C felony. That amendment failed.\nState Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison (D-Birmingham) went further during that debate, suggesting that \u201ca castration bill\u201d should be introduced.\nVasectomies under Hollis\u2019 bill would be at the man\u2019s expense. HB 238 has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee. The legislation is very much dead-on-arrival in the Alabama legislature.\nOn the same day HB 238 was introduced, State Rep. Ginny Shaver (R-Leesburg) reintroduced an anti-infanticide bill she first filed last session. Hollis on Thursday also filed a bill that would require local Alabama boards of education to provide feminine hygiene products in\u00a0female restrooms at public schools in their respective jurisdictions.\nSean Ross is the editor of Yellowhammer News.
