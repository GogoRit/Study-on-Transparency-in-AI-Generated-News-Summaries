(Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indiana Supreme Court on Monday denied a request to rehear its ruling upholding the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\u00a0\nThe decision was quickly certified on the court docket, meaning the new law \u2014 which prohibits the procedure with few exceptions \u2014 is in effect. Abortions can now only be performed in hospitals under very narrow circumstances.\nIn a split, 4-1 decision, high court justices reaffirmed in their order that Planned Parenthood and other health care providers \u201ccannot show a reasonable likelihood of success\u201d with their challenge to the abortion restrictions because there are cases in which the ban could be constitutionally enforced.\n  Chief Justice Loretta Rush (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)\nChief Justice Loretta H. Rush, who concurred with the ruling, reiterated in her own opinion that Indiana\u2019s Constitution grants a woman\u2019s right to terminate a pregnancy \u201cto protect her life or to protect her from a serious health risk \u2026 under circumstances that extend beyond the current law.\u201d\n\u201cGiven that possibility, I am deeply concerned about Senate Bill 1\u2019s impact on Hoosier women\u2019s constitutional right to seek medical care that is necessary to protect their life or to protect them from a serious health risk. And I am likewise concerned about the law\u2019s impact on healthcare providers who must determine whether to provide that care and potentially expose themselves to criminal penalties and professional sanctions,\u201d Rush wrote in her opinion. \u201cBut Plaintiffs have not properly put these concerns before us.\u201d\u00a0\nIndividual court challenges based on specific cases will now likely head to court as conflicts arise.\nJustices close the matter \u2014 for now\nRush said the original injunction \u2014 which prevented the near-total abortion ban from being enforced in its entirety \u2014 was improper, and that \u201cthere is simply no sound legal basis for an interim injunction that is even broader than the relief plaintiffs intend to pursue in the trial court.\u201d\nShe added that, \u201cfor good reason,\u201d the judicial system requires those challenging the law to first seek narrower relief in the trial court, which unlike the state Supreme Court, \u201ccan receive and weigh competing evidence, including expert testimony.\u201d\nStory continues below.\nAppellees Petition for Rehearin\n\u00a0\nBut Justice Christopher M. Goff dissented, writing in a separate opinion that he would rather leave a revised statewide injunction in place, preventing the ban from being enforced \u201cin circumstances where a physician has determined in good faith that an abortion is medically necessary.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis would be for a limited time \u2014 perhaps 60 days \u2014 so the trial court can hear arguments and evidence and consider whether to enter a new injunction,\u201d Goff wrote. \u201cMaintaining this restriction for now would provide the added benefit of preserving a stable legal environment for women, healthcare providers, and law enforcement.\u201d\nThe ban outlaws all abortions except in the case of a fatal fetal anomaly and cases of serious health risk to the mother. One part of the law says these exceptions are up to 20 weeks but another part says they can be used anytime. Rape survivors can get an abortion up to 10 weeks post-fertilization.\nGoff, who also dissented in the June ruling, said the new abortion restrictions do not prohibit the procedure when necessary \u201cto prevent death or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d\u00a0\nBut the justice noted that the exception does not include psychological or emotional conditions, including instances in which a woman shows signs that she intends to hurt herself.\nGoff contended that the law, as written, does not allow abortions in response to:\n\nconditions that cause serious pain, suffering, or disability without irreversible impairment\nsevere psychiatric illnesses, which may require medication that can\u2019t be taken during pregnancy\npsychiatric issues that may lead to suicide or self harm\n\n\u201cThese are all potentially severe medical problems. And seeking medically necessary treatment for them likely falls within the ambit of the constitutional right to protect one\u2019s life and health,\u201d Goff wrote. \u201cUnless our colleagues in the General Assembly act to address these deficiencies, the State must be enjoined from enforcing Senate Bill 1 in ways that prevent women from seeking necessary medical aid.\u201d\n\u201cNo one yet knows the precise contours of the life and health protections guaranteed by the Indiana Constitution,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut, for the sake of the lives and health of Hoosier women, our healthcare professionals and our justice system need to know as quickly as possible. Having declared the right of a woman to protect her health, this Court should not now let that right go unprotected.\u201d\nWhat happens next\u00a0\nIn a similar split, 4-1 decision in June, the high court nixed a preliminary injunction that has kept the ban on hold since September. An injunction issued in a separate religious freedom challenge to the ban only applies to the plaintiffs in that case. The separate matter is continuing to play out in the Court of Appeals.\n  Justice Christopher M. Goff (Photo from Indiana Supreme Court)\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana, Planned Parenthood and the other plaintiffs that challenged the law in the constitutional case had 30 days after the Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling to seek a rehearing, before the decision was certified. In the meantime, that put the ban on hold. Rehearings are rarely granted, though.\nJustices left open the possibility for other challenges in the future, however.\n\u201cToday is a dark day in Indiana\u2019s history, as a near-total abortion ban takes effect. We have seen the horrifying impact of bans like this across the country, and the narrow exceptions included in this extreme ban will undoubtedly put Hoosiers\u2019 lives at risk,\u201d ACLU of Indiana executive director Jane Henegar said Monday in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to fight in court to clarify and expand upon the current exceptions. Every person should have the fundamental freedom to control their own body and politicians\u2019 personal opinions should play no part in this personal decision.\u201d\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, on the other hand, said the high court\u2019s decision \u201cis great news for Hoosier life and liberty.\u201d\n\u201cMy office promised to defend Indiana\u2019s pro-life law, and we have done that every step of the way. Today, the Indiana Supreme Court certified its opinion rejecting a constitutional challenge to Indiana\u2019s pro-life law, which protects the lives of innocent, unborn babies,\u201d Rokita said Monday. \u201cWe defeated the pro-death advocates who try to interject their views in a state that clearly voted for life.\u201d\nMedical providers across the state had already stopped providing abortion care services altogether. Patients are instead being referred to clinics outside the state.\nThe five Indiana justices heard oral arguments over the constitutionality of the new law in January.\nThe court challenge was originally filed in Monroe County Circuit Court in August 2022 by the ACLU on behalf of health care providers and a pregnancy resource center.\nA special judge in Owen County later ruled that the ban likely violates the Indiana Constitution.\u00a0\nAn injunction issued by Judge Kelsey Blake Hanlon, a Republican, halted the state\u2019s new abortion law one week after it took effect. Under the injunction, the state\u2019s previous abortion law stood \u2014 allowing abortions up to 20 weeks.\nThe Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly advanced the abortion-restricting measure during a heated, two-week special session last August.\nThat action made Indiana the first state in the nation to approve such legislation since the high court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIndiana Supreme Court won\u2019t rehear near-total abortion ban ruling, putting law back in effect\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle August 21, 2023\nIndiana Supreme Court won\u2019t rehear near-total abortion ban ruling, putting law back in effect\nby Casey Smith, Indiana Capital Chronicle August 21, 2023\n The Indiana Supreme Court on Monday denied a request to rehear its ruling upholding the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban.\u00a0\nThe decision was quickly certified on the court docket, meaning the new law \u2014 which prohibits the procedure with few exceptions \u2014 is in effect.
