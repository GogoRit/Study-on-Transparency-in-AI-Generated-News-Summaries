Any medical professionals carrying out abortions face a life sentence in prison.\nNorthern Ireland urgently needs to bring its laws in line with human rights, before more women and girls suffer.\nLaw violates human rights\nSarah Ewart\u2019s first pregnancy was given a fatal foetal diagnosis and she had to travel to England to terminate her pregnancy as it was illegal at home, turning her life into a living nightmare.\nTogether with Sarah and Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission we took her case to the Belfast High Court and today it ruled that laws governing abortion in Northern Ireland are in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nThis is welcome news, but it\u2019s shameful that the Courts have had to step in because politicians have repeatedly failed Northern Ireland\u2019s women.\n'I hope that today\u2019s ruling means that I, and other women like me, will no longer have to go through the pain I experienced, of having to travel to England, away from the care of the doctors and midwife who knew me, to access the healthcare I needed.\n'I, and many women like me have been failed by our politicians. First, they left me with no option but to go to England for medical care. Then, by their refusal to change the law, they left me with no option but to go to the courts on my and other women's behalf.'\nSarah Ewart\n\nThis decision is a hugely significant step towards ensuring the right to access abortion for women and girls in Northern Ireland who have been raped, are victims of incest or whose pregnancies have been given a fatal foetal diagnosis.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s laws on abortion date back to the nineteenth century and carry the harshest criminal penalties in Europe.\nJudge Mr Justice Mark Horner told Belfast High Court that women\u2019s human rights were being breached by current laws.\n'In the circumstances, given this issue is unlikely to be grasped by the legislature in the foreseeable future, and the entitlement of citizens of Northern Ireland to have their Convention rights protected by the courts, I conclude that the Article Eight rights of women in Northern Ireland who are pregnant with fatal foetal abnormalities or who are pregnant as a result of sexual crime are breached by the impugned provisions.'\nJudge Mr Justice Mark Horner\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws must be brought into the twenty-first century and into line with international law as a matter of urgency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          18 May 2020, 05:28pm\n        \n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related\n\n\nMore about abortion in Ireland and Northern Ireland\nNI abortion law 'breaches human rights' (BBC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While you\u2019re here\u2026\nLike you, we are horrified by the violence and the civilian death toll in Gaza, Israel and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
