Wade on June 24, 2022.\n        \n\nCredit:\n Evan L'Roy/The Texas Tribune\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nTexas anti-abortion conservatives are intensifying their efforts to shut down access for residents seeking abortions, with a near-daily drumbeat of threats and court filings aimed at donors, employers and others trying to help those patients.\nThey are part of a broad campaign by the anti-abortion rights movement, in the days since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the constitutional right to abortion last month, to dry up avenues of assistance for Texans who have no access to abortion under several state laws and punish providers who have tried to legally continue offering services in a constantly changing legal landscape.\nIn their crosshairs are not just providers, but also nonprofit funding groups and the donors who support them; people who volunteer time or give money to abortion providers; employers who support pregnant workers in getting abortions; and the abortion clinics and employees themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAny person who was complicit in these illegal abortions\u2014including [provider] Whole Woman\u2019s Health employees, volunteers, and donors, and anyone who aided or abetted these illegal abortions in any manner, apart from the formerly pregnant woman upon whom the illegal abortion was performed \u2014 is equally liable under the Texas Heartbeat Act and equally guilty of murder,\u201d reads a recent court filing by attorney Jonathan Mitchell, the legal architect of many of those efforts, including Senate Bill 8, a Texas law that bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected and allows citizens to sue suspected violators.\nWhen the Supreme Court decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade becomes official, expected later this summer, a Texas \u201ctrigger law\u201d will go into effect that criminalizes abortion providers for performing illegal procedures and exposes them to a potential sentence of life in prison.\nThe trigger law does not address those who \u201caid and abet\u201d abortions, but those groups and individuals are included in SB 8, as well as a century-old law criminalizing abortion that went back into effect earlier this month after being suspended for decades while Roe was in effect. That 1925 law carries penalties of up to five years in prison for anyone who performs or assists an abortion.\nNo criminal charges have been filed under the 1925 law, and the state\u2019s trigger law hasn\u2019t been activated yet, but most abortion providers and funding groups have shut down or paused their operations or moved out of state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the trigger law takes effect, the state will have at least three separate laws on the books that collectively make abortion from the moment of conception illegal in Texas, in almost all cases, and hold violators liable either civilly or criminally.\nBut abortion opponents are ready to ask for more, threatening new laws that would extend Texas abortion laws beyond state lines, widen prosecutors\u2019 powers to pursue abortion cases and further criminalize anyone who tries to help Texans get abortions.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re emboldened, and I also think that frankly, the base that they\u2019ve become dependent on is going to demand that they just keep going,\u201d said Dallas attorney Elizabeth Myers, who represents Lilith Fund, an abortion-funding group and advocacy organization that is among those being targeted in civil court filings and by Texas legislators. \u201cThey will go until the court says no.\u201d\nOn the civil side, courts in conservative Denton and Jack counties are likely to start hearing arguments in the coming weeks over whether to let Mitchell interview, under oath, two major funding groups about their involvement in potentially illegal procedures under both the 1925 law and SB 8. A similar request was filed by Mitchell in Howard County last week targeting abortion providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that effort is successful, the information and documents that the abortion providers and supporters may be forced to turn over could help anti-abortion rights attorneys build lawsuits against them.\nAnd although civil depositions can\u2019t be legally used in criminal cases, they are public records and could be easily obtained by local prosecutors seeking an evidentiary road map for their own criminal cases.\nCourt rulings bring confusion over what\u2019s legal\nLast month, a Harris County district judge issued a temporary restraining order that barred Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the state medical board and district attorneys in Texas\u2019 five most populous counties, as well as Hidalgo County, from enforcing the 1925 law.\nThat decision caused clinics in those counties to resume abortions for five days, despite Paxton\u2019s threat to prosecute them and their allies if the Texas Supreme Court overruled the lower court \u2014 which it did by the end of the week. That July 1 ruling allowed Paxton to enforce the 1925 ban, but it did not address the lower court\u2019s decision that blocked the law\u2019s enforcement in the six urban counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinics in those counties shut down anyway out of fear that Paxton\u2019s office would take action against them, even if local district attorneys could not. Meanwhile, neither court ruling blocked prosecutors in the state\u2019s other 248 counties from enforcing the 1925 law, a Texas Supreme Court spokesperson told The Texas Tribune in a statement.\nAlthough no criminal charges have been filed yet under that law, abortions performed during that week in late June and early July after the Harris County judge\u2019s ruling will likely be at the crux of some of the first civil, and potentially criminal, abortion cases in Texas, Myers said.\n\u201cI will be absolutely shocked if there is not some sort of criminal prosecution that happens in the next several months,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWhich is a terrifying thing to say. But that\u2019s where they\u2019re going.\u201d\nLetter to law firm threatens action under 1925 law\nIf the laws aren\u2019t there now to support everything that abortion opponents want to pursue, they may soon be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith four months to go before statehouse elections and then two more after that before the new legislative session convenes in Austin, legislation is already being drafted to severely curtail the abilities of companies to aid employees with travel costs or other services that would help them circumvent state abortion laws, including threats to disbar lawyers that attempt to help their own employees.\nThere is also the potential for proposals that try to ban pregnant Texans from getting abortions anywhere, both inside Texas and outside state lines.\nSuggestions of what\u2019s to come can be found in a letter that the Freedom Caucus \u2014 a group of Texas Republican House members who are among the chamber\u2019s most conservative \u2014 sent last week to the law firm Sidley Austin LLP, one of many employers that have announced plans to support employees who need to travel out of state to terminate their pregnancies.\nThe lawmakers \u2014 who are also lawyers \u2014 warned that it\u2019s already illegal under Texas law for people to leave the state to obtain abortion-inducing medicines, then take them at home in Texas. The medicines are often administered at home and over the course of more than one day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter says that if the law firm reimburses travel expenses or otherwise helps an employee in doing that \u2014 or similarly circumventing state law \u2014 they are violating the 1925 law.\n\u201cConduct yourselves accordingly,\u201d the letter warns.\nIt also accuses Sidley of already breaking the law and warns that they are subject to civil and criminal prosecution under a section of the ban that specifically targets anyone who knowingly \u201cfurnishes the means\u201d for an illegal abortion.\n\u201cWe are putting them and others on notice of the illegality and consequences of their actions under pre-Roe statutes,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter also says the lawmakers are planning to propose legislation that would allow district attorneys from anywhere in the state to prosecute abortion violations outside their own jurisdiction if the local DA refuses, as several have, to enforce the state\u2019s new abortion laws.\nThe question of whether any of that is even constitutional isn\u2019t much of a deterrent, Myers said, as evidenced by years of attempts to pass legislation that opponents say tramples on abortion rights.\n\u201cThey do not care if anything is ultimately unconstitutional or even if they lose, because they get the benefit of terrorizing people through a fear campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fear and the threats have been ratcheted up, but the tactic of the fear campaign is identical to what they\u2019ve been doing for years.\u201d\nPre-lawsuit digging\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health and Alamo Women\u2019s Reproductive Services, two prominent Texas abortion providers, announced this month that they were moving out of Texas \u2014 even as Mitchell filed court documents almost two weeks ago in Big Spring seeking to depose some of their officers in anticipation of suing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe petition accuses the providers and their financial supporters of murder and seeks to gather information from them that may help with lawsuits against them on behalf of Texas citizens seeking to enforce SB 8.\nMitchell also wants the right for attorneys to question the executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund and the deputy director of the Lilith Fund for the same reason.\nBoth organizations have paused their funding that helps Texans pay for abortions.\nMitchell\u2019s requests to have the two funds deposed, filed in February in Denton and Jack counties, are expected to be set for a hearing in early August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf lawsuits against them are eventually filed under SB 8 and are successful, each defendant could be penalized at least $10,000 in damages per violation plus court charges.\nNeesha Dav\u00e9, the deputy director at Lilith Fund whom Mitchell wants to question, said it\u2019s not enough for abortion rights opponents to have won the battle to stop abortions in Texas. They also want punish and put out of business anyone who has ever helped, or even intended to help, Texans seeking abortion, she said.\n\u201cThey are ruthless in their purpose of achieving that,\u201d Dav\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd they will stop at nothing.\u201d\n\n\nJoin us at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 22-24 in downtown Austin, and hear from 300+ speakers shaping the future of Texas including Joe Straus, Jen Psaki, Joaquin Castro, Mayra Flores and many others.
