(Photo credit should read OSCAR RIVERA/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe following press release was shared on Monday evening by the Women\u2019s Equality Center:\nSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador \u2014 In the wake of the landmark acquittal of Evelyn Beatriz Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, a 21-year-old rape survivor falsely accused of aggravated homicide for experiencing a stillbirth, Evelyn and women\u2019s rights activists across El Salvador are demanding justice and freedom for more than 17 women still imprisoned under the country\u2019s total abortion ban.\u00a0El Salvador is considered to have the most extreme abortion ban in the world and is one of the only countries known to prosecute and imprison women in cases of obstetric emergencies.\nEvelyn faced the threat of a third trial after the Attorney General\u2019s office appealed the decision of the court that declared her innocent, preventing her from reconstructing her life freely and fully. Evelyn\u2019s imprisonment was recently declared arbitrary and contrary to international human rights by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions.\u00a0\nPresident\u00a0Bukele has\u00a0publicly stated\u00a0that no woman should be imprisoned for experiencing an obstetric emergency, and has also expressed that there should be exceptions on the criminalization of abortion when a woman\u2019s life and health are at risk.\u00a0\nEvelyn Hern\u00e1ndez said:\u00a0\u201cI was made the victim of a justice system that is anything but just. I know that there are countless other women who have experienced the same in a country where miscarriages are still considered a crime and reproductive rights are nonexistent. We must stand up and demand that the Salvadoran government release all the remaining women who have been wrongfully put behind bars like me. The fight does not end here.\u201d\nPaula \u00c1vila-Guill\u00e9n, Director of Latin America Initiatives at the Women\u2019s Equality Center, said: \u201cEvelyn\u2019s case cast an international spotlight on the horrific reality of El Salvador\u2019s abortion ban and drew an outpouring of support for a rape survivor whose only crimes were being poor and a woman in a country that criminalizes both. While Evelyn is finally free, more than 14 innocent women are currently in prison who should immediately be released; together, they have served a combined of over 50 years behind bars and are further proof that abortion bans always and inevitably target vulnerable women with no means of defense or recourse. Evelyn\u2019s case, and the global response to El Salvador\u2019s cruel mistreatment of women and girls like her, should be a clear wake-up call to President Bukele and the courts that liberating the women incarcerated under this cruel law is long overdue.\u201d\nBackground on Evelyn:\nEvelyn became pregnant at age 18 as a result of sexual violence in her community and delivered a stillborn child in April 2016. There is no evidence showing that Evelyn ever attempted to end the pregnancy or harm the fetus. Despite this, in July 2017, Evelyn was sentenced to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide. After serving 33 months in prison, the decision was overturned by a judge on appeal in February 2019 for lack of evidence. Prosecutors decided to retry Evelyn on the same charges and Evelyn faced 40 years in prison before she was acquitted in August 2019.\nBackground on El Salvador\u2019s Total Abortion Ban:\nEl Salvador has had a total abortion ban since 1998, including in cases where the woman\u2019s life is at risk or the pregnancy results from rape or incest. El Salvador is the only country known to regularly prosecute and imprison women as a result of the abortion ban \u2013 even in cases where the women suffered\u00a0 miscarriages, stillbirths and other obstetric emergencies. Today, more than 20 women are in prison under trumped up charges of manslaughter, homicide, or aggravated homicide after being accused of having an abortion. In total, at least 50 women have been imprisoned.\n\u00a0\n***\nThe Women\u2019s Equality Center supports communications and campaigns on reproductive health, rights and justice. Currently, the organization engages on initiatives in Latin American countries that have total bans on abortion including El Salvador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic, and other countries in the region where abortion access is extremely limited. WEC is a project of the New Venture Fund, a 501c3 nonprofit.\nPaula \u00c1vila-Guill\u00e9n is the Director of Latin America Initiatives at the Women\u2019s Equality Center (WEC). Paula has over ten years of experience designing and implementing advocacy and litigation strategies to address a variety of human rights issues in multiple geopolitical spaces at the local, national and international levels.\nMore From LRSalvadoran Abortion Case Enters Final Phase at\u2026Activists' Network in Mexico Helps U.S. Women Get AbortionsTime to Confront Sexual Assault, Protect Women's\u2026Share this:FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInTumblrEmail\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a ReplyCancel reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
