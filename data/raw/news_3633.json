With the court having struck down the law this June, his speech at Right to Life\u2019s fundraiser came off as pragmatic rather than celebratory.\u201cIt\u2019s now up to localities and states to protect the unborn, which means that our job just got a lot more vital,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt was always a hard job, but there was a barrier in the way of actually getting things done. Well, now that barrier is gone.\u201cPolitics isn\u2019t just a matter of electing the right people,\u201d added Shapiro, a frequent critic of former President Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of getting the wrong people to do the right thing.\u201dAs is common when Shapiro visits cities or college campuses to speak \u2014 with his standard fee ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 \u2014 a group of protesters gathered outside the Century Center to rebuke both him and Right to Life Michiana, the area\u2019s leading anti-abortion organization.About two dozen protesters who say they\u2019re South Bend community members declined to speak to a reporter or give identifying information. They wore masks or covered their entire faces in fear of being harassed by local conservative groups working to identify counterprotesters at a drag show the Michiana Proud Boys tried to disrupt last week.Most protesters stood across Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and faced a line of hundreds of attendees, holding signs saying \"Stop Christian fascism\" and leading chants like, \u201cGet your rosaries off our ovaries.\u201dOne particularly attention-grabbing sign, held by someone wearing a mask that appeared to portray the likeness of President Joe Biden, invoked the president\u2019s recent gaffe involving the late U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski, a staunch anti-abortion advocate: \u201cWhere\u2019s Jackie? I thought she was going to be here.\u201dRight to Life honored Walorski with a lifetime-achievement award before Shapiro\u2019s speech. The honor was accepted on her behalf by her husband, Dean Swihart, and her mother, Martha Walorski.Antonio Marchi, the executive director of Right to Life Michiana who recently replaced longtime leader Jackie Appleman, said many gathered never thought they\u2019d live to see a post-Roe world.He commended Indiana legislators for passing a near-total abortion ban in August. But lawsuits against the state, one of which is filed by a group of abortion providers that includes Whole Woman\u2019s Health of South Bend, shows the fight has only begun, Marchi said.The ban on abortions, excluding several rare exceptions, took effect Sept. 15. But a week later it was temporarily barred by a Republican judge in Owen County. In response to the abortion providers\u2019 lawsuit, Special Judge Kelsey Hanlon wrote that there\u2019s a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d the right to privacy in the Indiana Constitution protects decisions about family planning, including the choice to have an abortion.\u00a0Oral arguments will be made in mid-January, meaning abortion remains legal in Indiana. Marchi praised Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who was in the audience, for his coming defense of the law.'Women are more fulfilled when they have babies'Shapiro said anti-abortion advocates must now win the moral argument regarding the procedure. To that end, he spent about a half-hour making what he called a \u201csecular, humanist\u201d case against nearly all abortions \u2014 he makes a clear exception only when the life of the mother is at stake.\u201cA lot of people think that with Roe v. Wade over, the fight is over,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, no, no \u2014 this is when the fight actually starts.\u201dA slim majority of Indiana residents say they support abortion in the case of rape or if the life of the pregnant person is endangered, according to a survey conducted this summer that didn\u2019t ask about cases of incest. Two of five Hoosiers say they oppose abortions after six weeks, while a quarter support them beyond that timeframe. About 35% of people said they were neutral.Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban allows exemptions for all three of the above cases, as well as when fatal fetal anomalies are present. Medical professionals have criticized the portion protecting a mother\u2019s health as troublingly vague, however.LGBTQ:The Michiana Proud Boys aimed to disrupt another South Bend LGBTQ event. This time they failed.An Orthodox Jew, Shapiro said he wants to help people who oppose abortion because of their religious views to avoid being lumped into the category of \u201creligious crazy people.\u201dHe rejected the view of some non-Orthodox Jews that abortions may occur under certain circumstances barred by Indiana\u2019s law. A group called Hoosier Jews for Choice is part of a lawsuit against the state that alleges the new law violates Jewish people\u2019s religious freedom.Shapiro\u2019s anti-abortion stance is at bottom a belief in the Judeo-Christian view that people are more fulfilled when they raise children. He called a woman\u2019s choice to have an abortion because she isn\u2019t financially or emotionally ready \u201cabsurd.\u201d No one is truly ready to be a parent, argued Shapiro, who has three young children.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWomen are freer, women are happier, women are more fulfilled when they have babies,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cHow this has become a controversial proposition in America is beyond conception.\u201d\u201cIf we actually wish to have a civilization,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to fall in love again with the idea that \u2026 women having babies is an active good \u2014 in fact, the highest active good.\u201dEmail South Bend Tribune city reporter Jordan Smith at JTsmith@gannett.com.
