Still, they are finding different ways of winning.\nEmily Belz in New York|July 1, 2022  10:00 AM\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage: Spencer Platt / Getty Images\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul speaks at a protest against the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson.\nAs pro-life groups nationally celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and as pro-lifers in red states debated how far to go with abortion restrictions, pro-lifers in blue states are watching setbacks they think will take years to undo.\nPro-life lobbyists in states such as California and New York are dealing with a deluge of legislation expanding abortion access\u2014reducing licensing requirements for abortion providers, adding public funding for abortions, shielding abortion clinics from liability for out-of-state patients, and creating state commissions to investigate crisis pregnancy centers.\nBlue states are also considering constitutional amendments on abortion rights, which pro-lifers worry would hurt their cause for decades. At this moment, no US state has named abortion protections in its state constitution. The states debating such amendments already have abortion codified in their laws, but adding it to the constitution would keep abortion protected even if political power in the state changed and the legislature reversed its abortion laws.\n\u201cIn New York and California and other states, it\u2019s like working under Newton\u2019s third law of motion,\u201d said evangelical Jason McGuire, who leads New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms. McGuire has worked for 16 years in the state legislature on stemming abortion laws, often the lone lobbyist on the issue alongside the New York Catholic Conference. \u201cEvery time something good happens at the national level, we know there\u2019s going to be some pushback at the state level.\u201d\nThe legislature in Vermont, where abortion is legal up until birth for any reason, passed a constitutional amendment earlier this year stating that \u201can individual\u2019s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one\u2019s own life course.\u201d That amendment now goes to voters in November.\nMary Beerworth has worked with Vermont Right to Life since the mid-1980s and became the executive director in 1996. She jokes that she has been working on pro-life issues in Vermont for \u201cI think 112 years.\u201d She said when legislators would see her and her one coworker approaching about the constitutional amendment on abortion, \u201cThey put in their earplugs.\u201d\nIn all her years working on the issue, she has never seen pro-life legislation pass. The state had legal abortion through court order a year before Roe, and in the decades since then, \u201cabortion rights were never endangered.\u201dAfter Dobbs, Beerworth\u2019s organization was happy for the decision but didn\u2019t stop to celebrate. She and her colleague watched the other side hold rallies. The ruling \u201chas done a tremendous amount of damage,\u201d Beerworth said, in how it affected Vermont.\nThe Supreme Court decision gave Vermonters impetus to vote for the constitutional amendment, which she sees as vague enough about \u201creproductive autonomy\u201d to create all sorts of problems beyond abortion (for example, she notes that the amendment does not specify adults and could include minors).\nBut Beerworth talked herself into peppiness again, saying that with the general election battle over the abortion amendment, her group can educate more voters to know that Vermont legalizes abortion in all circumstances: \u201cThey\u2019ve given us an opportunity here.\u201d\nIn California, Molly Sheahan, the California Catholic Conference\u2019s lobbyist on abortion issues, also felt the strange juxtaposition when the Dobbs decision came down at 7 a.m. her time on June 24. She felt \u201cgratitude to God\u201d\u2014after 49 years of work from the pro-life side\u2014but then said to herself, \u201cAll right, what\u2019s next?\u201d She knew she had business in the legislature to attend to.\nThe Monday after the Dobbs decision, California passed a constitutional amendment establishing an individual\u2019s \u201cfundamental right to choose to have an abortion\u201d that will also go to voters for approval in November. The Catholic conference said the language was so vague that it would legalize abortion up until birth.\nThe California Family Council, a Christian organization led by evangelical Jonathan Keller, has joined the campaign to oppose the amendment, also focusing on the fact that the language would allow abortion until birth. Keller was feeling optimistic about the issue being by itself on a ballot, without a candidate attached to it: That might allow it to cut through normal partisan, socioeconomic, and denominational divides on abortion. Pro-life groups need to run a good education campaign, he said.\n\u201cThis basically makes it impossible to regulate or protect women and children in any capacity,\u201d he said. In California, \u201cfunctionally, abortion is legal essentially for almost any reason whatsoever. But \u2026 this would make this explicit. It\u2019s bad when the killing is done through loopholes, it\u2019s worse when it\u2019s affirmatively declared within the constitution itself.\u201dThe constitutional amendment had so many sponsors when it was introduced that Sheahan knew the legislature already had the votes for it to pass. She turned her lobbying attention to what she said was a record number of abortion bills in a California legislative session: 19.\nThirteen of the bills came from the California Future of Abortion Council, a coalition of pro-choice groups, and included measures like funding to expand the workforce providing abortions and setting up additional abortion funds and grants. The Catholic bishops of California stated that \u201cby providing extensive funding for abortion services without any corresponding equitable funding for pregnant women and mothers, the state exercises a destructive, coercive power in favor of ending innocent lives.\u201d Sheahan was testifying against the bills the same week Dobbs came down.\nEarlier in June, New York passed a large package of abortion legislation, including the authorization of a state commission to investigate the negative impact of crisis pregnancy centers. New York City\u2019s Department of Health describes crisis pregnancy centers as \u201cfake clinics \u2026 that try to stop people from getting abortions.\u201d The centers have been subjects of firebombing and vandalism since Dobbs.\nPregnancy centers, pro-life and usually Christian affiliated, serve women in need at no cost. They provide counseling (including post-abortive counseling), donations, housing support, and often a range of health services like STD testing and ultrasounds. In New York, they are required to post signage about whether they have licensed medical staff.\nOne week after Dobbs, the New York legislature called a special session . One topic on the table was a constitutional amendment that included abortion rights. Unlike California and other states considering abortion amendments, New York faced significant opposition to the amendment from Christian groups and an Orthodox Jewish group, Agudath Israel. The religious groups argued the amendment\u2014a general \u201cequality\u201d amendment that lists protections for choosing abortion alongside other protected classes\u2014did not list religion as a protected class alongside the other rights.The final version of the amendment included religion as a protected class alongside \u201cpregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health care and autonomy,\u201d a grab bag of words to try to cover abortion, contraception, and beyond. Catholics and evangelicals continued to oppose the amendment.\nNew York legalized abortion before Roe v. Wade, and in recent years it has made state abortion laws more expansive, removing certain licensing requirements for those performing abortions and making abortions legal up until birth for the life or health of the mother.\nMcGuire worked for years with his Catholic counterpart to combat those expansions, codified in the Reproductive Health Act. A coalition of Republican and Democratic legislators (including one key Jewish senator) blocked the act until it finally passed in 2019 when Democrats took a bigger majority.\nPro-life activists in blue states take the victories they can find.\n\u201cPeople will think it\u2019s just a constant uphill battle; it\u2019s challenging and defeatist,\u201d said California\u2019s Sheahan, who grew up in Sacramento. She doesn\u2019t feel that way. \u201cIt\u2019s my home, it\u2019s worth fighting for. There\u2019s always hope.\u201d\nEven California\u2019s abortion amendment she saw as an opportunity to provide legislative testimony and talk to voters ahead of the November ballot.\n\u201cYou\u2019re finding different ways of winning,\u201d she said.\nBuilding a social safety net is one way of winning in a blue state. Sheahan has been working on other measures in the legislature on increasing hotel vouchers for homeless pregnant mothers, upping visiting hours for incarcerated moms with their kids, and expanding paid family leave for low-wage workers.\nLegislators take her seriously on safety net legislation because they also know that the church is a large provider of social services on its own. The California Catholic conference put together a website in response to the expected reversal of Roe with resources for Catholics looking to help mothers, donate items to youth in foster programs, and support pregnancy centers or the church\u2019s rental assistance programs.\nThe New York Catholic Conference\u2019s Kristen Curran, who has been lobbying against abortion measures in the legislature, said red states could learn from blue states on building a safety net for families.\u201cMake it safer and more doable to bring children into this world and raise them,\u201d Curran said.\nThe evangelical McGuire supports measures like tax credits for families and other measures to keep families intact. He noted that New York Governor Kathy Hochul put millions into funding out-of-state abortions but not \u201chelping mothers in this state who are choosing life.\u201d\n\u201cWe see it as a long game,\u201d said Curran. \u201cEven though we know it\u2019s a loser on the legislative stuff, we still come out and issue statements, I go on the news. We want to serve as a source of reminder to people what is at stake here.\u201d\nEven as New York debated an abortion amendment, advocates for an abortion amendment in Michigan announced they had enough signatures to put the amendment on the ballot for voters in November.\nVermont Right to Life\u2019s Beerworth tries to stay focused on what she can do. In the 1980s, Vermont had about 3,500 abortions a year. Now, it\u2019s about 1,200.\n\u201cI keep my energy up because really the goal is dropping the number of abortions. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing all these years,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the law says abortion is legal and there are zero of them, we win.\u201d\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 2024Subscribe\n\nRead This Issue\nEmpty Streets to the Empty GraveHackers Try to Take AI to ChurchI Hated \u2018Church People.\u2019 But I Knew I Needed Them.\n\n\n\nFollow @CTmagazine\nFree NewslettersYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\nMore Newsletters\n\n\n\n\nReply on XJoin in on FacebookFollow us on InstagramShare on TelegramYour daily news briefing from the editors of CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Our WorkSubscribe to CT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t for less than $4.25/month\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTags:\u00a0AbortionCatholic-Evangelical RelationsPoliticsPro-Life MovementRoe v.
