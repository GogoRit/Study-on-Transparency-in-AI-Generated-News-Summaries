A Friday deadline is looming.\nSupporters submitted more than 700,000 signatures, easily clearing the threshold. But a tie vote by the Board of State Canvassers over spacing issues on the petition has kept it off the ballot so far.\nIn the case handled by Gleicher, the 1931 law makes it a crime to perform abortions unless the life of the mother is in danger.\nThe judge found the law \u201ccompels motherhood\u201d and prevents a woman from determining the \u201cshape of her present and future life\u201d.\n\nThe law \u201cforces a pregnant woman to forgo her reproductive choices and to instead serve as \u2018an involuntary vessel entitled to no more respect than other forms of collectively owned property'\u201d, Gleicher wrote, quoting constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe.\nShe suspended the law in May with an injunction. Her latest decision applies to all state and local prosecutors in Michigan. The Republican-controlled House and Senate can appeal the ruling, which came in a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood.\nGleicher acknowledged in July that she has been a regular donor to the organisation and gave $1,000 to the campaigns of Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats who support abortion rights.\nBut that support was not a reason to pass the case to another judge, said Gleicher, who also serves as chief judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals.\nIn a separate lawsuit, Whitmer has repeatedly asked the state Supreme Court to bypass lower courts and settle the status of the 1931 law. The court has not decided whether to intervene.\nSource: The Associated Pressaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"
