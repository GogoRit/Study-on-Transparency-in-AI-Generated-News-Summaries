Wade is overturned by the country's highest court.\u00a0Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director Matt Sande told USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin\u00a0Friday that his organization believes there are no situations where an abortion would be medically necessary to save the pregnant person's life.\u00a0Sande said that would not include operations like removing an ectopic pregnancy or removing a cancerous uterus, which they consider \"moral even under Catholic teaching.\"\u00a0Sande said \"many\"\u00a0Wisconsin lawmakers would support a total ban on abortion, and said the state would \"have the power to completely ban abortion without exception\" if a governor opposed to abortion is elected.Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed legislation aimed at restricting abortion access. All four Republican gubernatorial candidates support significant abortion restrictions, without exceptions for\u00a0cases of rape and incest.\u00a0Abortion is currently legal in Wisconsin, but an 1849 state law would\u00a0ban most abortions in the state if Roe is overturned \u2014 an outcome that appears possible\u00a0following a draft opinion from the United States Supreme Court that was leaked last week.\u00a0The\u00a0 Wisconsin statute currently makes an exception\u00a0if a doctor decides it \"is necessary, or is advised by two\u00a0other physicians as necessary, to save the life of the mother.\"\u00a0RELATED:\u00a0Wisconsin abortions declined 60% in three decades, new report showsRELATED:\u00a0Almost all abortions would be illegal in Wisconsin if leaked Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe standsSande said he believes the exception could become a \"massive statutory loophole\" for doctors. Instead, his group wants doctors to be required to work equally to save the parent and baby in cases of medical emergency.\u00a0\"If one or the other inadvertently dies, that's not an abortion, that's in God's hands,\" he said. They'd seek immunity for physicians in those cases, he said.\u00a0Doctors who care for people whose pregnancies are high-risk are already worried about the phrasing of the exception, saying such medical emergencies are rarely clear-cut scenarios and arguing they don't want to put patients at increased risk.\u00a0Sande said his organization has not been focused on interpreting or clarifying the existing language.\u00a0\"We just want it gone,\" he said.\u00a0Many voters and organizations advocate against a total ban on abortionsMike Murray, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, called the comments \"incredibly alarming and disturbing.\"\u00a0He said advocating for a total ban without exceptions is indicative of the direction some abortion opponents want to go, but that it doesn't represent the beliefs of the majority of Wisconsinites.\u00a0In an October poll conducted by the Marquette University Law School, 61% of Wisconsin voters\u00a0said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Eleven percent said it should be illegal in all cases.\"The fact that proponents of this agenda want to even remove an exception that would allow an abortion to be performed to specifically save the life of the mother indicates that the health, well-being and lives of women are not their priority,\" Murray said.\u00a0History shows that when abortions are banned, people die, he said. An October study out of the University of Colorado Boulder found that a nationwide abortion ban could\u00a0lead to a 21% increase in the number of pregnancy-related deaths overall and a 33% increase in pregnancy-related deaths among\u00a0Black Americans.\u00a0Not all anti-abortion groups in Wisconsin share Pro-Life Wisconsin's stance.\u00a0Wisconsin Right to Life lobbyist Gracie Skogman said her organization supports the exception and called the language in the statute \"very good.\"\u00a0They also advocate for doctors to make equal attempts to save the life of the pregnant person and their baby in emergencies, something she said scientific and medical advancements since the 1970s should help with.\u00a0But \"we are standing by and referencing that medical emergency language,\" Skogman said.\u00a0Become a subscriber to get unlimited access Download our app for the latest news We're on YouTube.
