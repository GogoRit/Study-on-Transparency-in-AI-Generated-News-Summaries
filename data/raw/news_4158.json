and act: A snapshot of the impacts of COVID-19 on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights and sexual and reproductive health.\n\nJordan, a country hosting more than 700,000 refugees in a complex region of the globe, has like most other countries been deeply affected by the impact of COVID-19 on its economy and social system.\nDuring April 2020, the UNFPA Jordan Country Office in coordination with Plan International and the Institute for Family Health (IFH)/Noor Al Hussein Foundation commissioned a rapid assessment of the COVID-19 situation in Jordan.\nThe overall purpose of this rapid assessment was to measure the impact of COVID-19 on gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health rights among adolescent girls and young women in Jordan, including persons with disabilities.\nDownload options\n\nrapid assessment report\n\n\n\n\n\n\npdf\n\n10.06 mb \n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmergencies, Protection from violence, Sexual and reproductive health and
