Almost 30 percent of people in the world think today that it is acceptable for a man to beat his partner.\nDescribing himself\u00a0 \u201ca proud feminist\u201d, Guterres urged all to fight this pushback.\u00a0 \u201cOnly through the equal participation of women can we benefit from the intelligence, experience and insights of all of humanity.\u201d\u00a0 (Source: UN)\n\nThank you for reading our article.
