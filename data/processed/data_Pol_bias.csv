The decision, made by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, removed the option for women to terminate pregnancies in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, previously a primary reason for legal abortions in the country. This change has led to significant emotional distress for women forced to continue such pregnancies, often amid fears that the child may not survive.

Organizations like Ciocia Basia, a Berlin-based charity, have reported a sharp rise in calls from Polish women looking for help. Abortion Without Borders (AWB), a multinational coalition, has also observed a surge in requests for assistance, particularly as protestors at mass demonstrations against the ruling chanted the coalition’s name and contact information. AWB has already supported more than 40 women in obtaining abortions outside Poland since the ruling—a notable increase from usual numbers.

Supporters of the ruling argue it protects the rights of fetuses with disabilities, seeing the previous law as discriminatory against disabled individuals. Right To Life UK, for example, praised the decision for its validation of individuals with disabilities as valued members of society.

The ban has sparked deep divisions within Poland, leading to widespread protests as people rally against what many view as a step back for women’s rights. This issue highlights broader debates over human rights, disability rights, and reproductive freedoms in the nation.","['Poland', 'Polish', 'Germany', 'Euro', 'English English', '##eutsch', '##iano', 'Europe', 'EU', 'Brussels', 'Europe', 'Union', 'C', 'Europe', 'Euro', 'Qatar', 'Focus', 'Japan', 'Dub', 'Euro', 'Us', 'Soul Of', 'South', 'Saudi', 'Dubai', 'Estonia', 'Sharjah', 'Azerbaijan', 'Qatar', 'Spain', 'New', 'Uzbekistan', 'Greece', 'Classic Piano Competition', 'Garden City', 'Kerala', 'Ron Barcel', 'Moldova', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'Euro', 'Euro', 'Poland', 'Polish', 'Germany', 'Polish', 'Euro']","Poland’s near-total abortion ban has led to an increase in Polish women seeking help in Germany for terminations. The change followed a court ruling that removed the allowance for abortions in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.

Volunteers, including Ula Bertin, highlight the emotional toll on women who were already planning abortions in Poland but are now unable to proceed. Many women are left facing the distress of carrying a nonviable pregnancy to term. Other organizations, such as Abortion Without Borders (AWB), have helped numerous women travel abroad for abortions—more than double the typical monthly rate.

Meanwhile, proponents of the court’s decision argue that it protects the rights of people with disabilities, as the previous law allowed for abortions based on disability, which they view as discriminatory.

I AGREE ENGLISH FOR AFRICA Programs Cardinal Tong calls for promoting a culture of life CHURCH Hong Kong protecting life science and technology Coronavirus Hong Kong Cardinal advocates for promoting a culture of life In his message for Pro-Life Day 2020, Cardinal John Tong of Hong Kong urges Christians to promote a culture of life, as the Church marks the 25th anniversary of the encyclical Evangelium Vitae. By Vatican News Cardinal John Tong, the Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong, has invited Christians to revisit the notion of the culture of life. His invitation came in a message ahead of Pro-Life Day 2020, which this year coincides with the 25th anniversary of the promulgation of Pope St. John Paul IIs 1995 encyclical, Evangelium Vitae The Gospel of Life. In the past seven months, noted Cardinal Tong, the pandemic Covid-19 has claimed the lives of over 810,000 persons and infected more than 23.5 million persons worldwide. This disaster drives us to reflect on the values and meaning of life and treasure them more. The encyclical, The Gospel of Life, is meant to be a precise and vigorous reaffirmation of the value of human life and its inviolability, and at the same time, a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God respect, protect, love and serve life, every human life! said Cardinal Tong, citing Evangelium Vitae. Cardinal Tong also explained that the fourth Pro-Life Day was postponed to 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of our Lady, because its original day - the feast of the Visitation - fell on 31 May 2020, which was also Pentecost Sunday. Covid-19 and the culture of death Cardinal Tong noted that, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some countries adopted some policies and attitudes that treated the pandemic lightly like the common flu or by handling it with the approach of herd immunity. These attitudes, he said, devalued our vulnerable brothers and sisters, caused us to neglect our responsibility to care for our brothers and sisters properly, and intensified the impact of the culture of death. Contrasting this with the encyclical Evangelium Vitae, Cardinal Tong said that St. John Paul II invited us to contemplate the meaning of life, its greatness and fantasy, respecting that everyone has a right to life. This reflection should, in turn, lead us to do goodlove and care for others, as the value of a person is not determined by any categories but simply because heshe is a person irrespective of any disability or incapability. He hailed the sacrifice of many priests who, in spite of infection rates, continued to visit coronavirus patients often at the risk of getting infected themselves. They live our Jesuss words, he said, no one has greater love than this, to lay down ones life for ones friends John 15 13. Promoting a new culture of life To foster a new culture of life, the Cardinal stressed on the importance of obeying Gods commandment Thou shall not kill. Obedience to this commandment, he further explained, includes not being angry with our brother, preaching the Gospel of life and supporting all the programmes, organizations and teachings that promote the values of life and serve the gospel of life. In this regard, human life is to be respected and treated as a gift from God, sacred and inviolable from conception to the time of natural death. Consequently, abortion and euthanasia are absolutely unacceptable as the value of life is based on giving and accepting love with the understanding that the conjugal acts of married couples are oriented to the procreation of life. Important also is the formation of conscience, noted the Cardinal, especially as our societies and mass media today are deeply influenced by the culture of death. He pointed out more education needs to be done to nourish a correct conscience in the face of a culture that causes confusion between good and evil, precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life. The role of family Cardinal Tong highlighted the important role of family as a sanctuary of life and the place where the couple welcomes a new life the gift of God. The family is also a place for daily individual and family prayers, to live out the gospel of life and for the special care of the elderly and the sick. In these capacities, he noted, the family has an indispensable role in fostering the culture of life. Science, technology in service of human life Cardinal Tong said that science and technology can be used in the service of human life and its integrity, insisting that advancements in biotechnology need to be understood in order to be used for the promotion and protection of life. In this regard, he acknowledged the role of the Bioethics Resource Center of the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Theology and Philosophy, the Diocesan Pastoral Commission for Marriage and Family, and Catholic schools which identify life as one of their core educational values. He also recommended the Creighton Model Fertility Care System for couples who are having difficulties in achieving pregnancies and natural family planning services for couples preparing to have children. Pointing out that contemporary society is torn between a culture of life and a culture of death, Cardinal Tong called for critical thinking that is capable of discerning true values and authentic needs to build a culture of life. In conclusion, he urged everyone to love and respect every human life, walk forward patiently and courageously, to foster the culture of life which is the fruit of truth and love.

Cardinal Tong highlighted the COVID-19 pandemic as a stark reminder of life’s fragility and underscored that approaches treating the virus lightly or favoring herd immunity reflect a disregard for vulnerable individuals, intensifying a “culture of death.”

Cardinal Tong called for a renewed commitment to the encyclical’s teachings, urging respect for all human life as inherently valuable, regardless of disabilities or vulnerabilities. He praised those who risked their lives, including priests, to support COVID-19 patients, embodying Jesus’s call to “lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” He argued that this “culture of life” is supported by adhering to commandments like “Thou shall not kill,” which extend beyond physical harm to include nurturing respect, promoting life values, and opposing abortion and euthanasia.

The Cardinal emphasized that family plays a critical role in this culture by welcoming new life, caring for the elderly, and fostering values that respect the sanctity of life. He also pointed to the positive role of science and technology, which, when guided by ethical principles, can support human dignity and life. Educational initiatives, like those provided by Catholic institutions and bioethics centers, help nurture a conscientious respect for life.

Concluding his message, Cardinal Tong urged society to respect and cherish every human life, advancing the culture of life through truth, love, and a commitment to human dignity from conception to natural death.","['Hong Kong', 'Vatican News', 'Vatican Church', 'English Italiano Italian Franais French', '##utsch German E', 'Spanish Portugus Portuguese Arabic Armenian Belarusian Bulgarian et', 'Czech Esperanto Hebrew H', '##rva', '##tski Croatian Magyar Hungarian Lietuvi Lithuanian Latvieu Latvian Macedonian Mongolian Polski Polish', 'Romanian', 'Albanian', 'Slovenin', '##a Slovak Slovenian Svenska Swedish Russian Ukrainian Hindi Malayalam Tamil', 'Vietnamese Japanese Korean', 'Chinese', 'Chinese English Africa Franais Afrique Portug', '##rica Kiswahili Swahili Amharic', 'T', '##igrinya Facebook Twitter', 'In', 'Vatican News', 'A', '##F', '##RICA', 'Cardinal Tong', 'Hong Kong', 'Corona', 'Hong Kong', 'Pro', 'Life Day 2020', 'John Tong', 'Hong Kong', 'Christians', 'Evangelium Vitae', 'Vatican News', 'John Tong', 'Hong Kong', 'Christians', 'Pro', 'Life Day 2020', 'Pope', 'John Paul', 'Tong']","Cardinal John Tong, Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong, delivered a message for Pro-Life Day 2020, urging Christians to promote a culture of life in honor of the 25th anniversary of Pope St. John Paul II’s Evangelium Vitae (The Gospel of Life). Cardinal Tong reflected on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused over 810,000 deaths and affected millions worldwide. He emphasized the need to cherish and respect human life, citing the encyclical’s call for every person to protect and serve life, regardless of individual differences.

He criticized early pandemic responses, which downplayed the virus’s severity and neglected the responsibility to protect vulnerable individuals, thus reinforcing a “culture of death.” In contrast, the Evangelium Vitae promotes respect for life, urging society to contemplate the sacredness of human existence, regardless of physical abilities or circumstances. Cardinal Tong praised the sacrifices of priests who risked their lives to care for the infected.

To foster a culture of life, the Cardinal underscored the importance of following God’s commandment “Thou shall not kill,” which includes controlling anger, preaching the Gospel of life, and opposing practices like abortion and euthanasia. He emphasized that life must be viewed as a sacred gift from God, requiring education to form consciences in a society influenced by the culture of death.

Quality sex education can lead to better prevention in STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Furthermore, it decreases the risks of having unsafe sex and increases responsible family planning. To help address issues, like overpopulation, high rates of teen pregnancy and the rise of HIV, the Philippines is gradually implementing sex education and accessibility to contraceptives. Reproductive Health Act The Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 RH Act after a 14-year wait. Through the act, the government integrated sex education into the public school curriculum for students ages 10 to 19. The Philippines also gave funding for free or subsidized contraceptives at health centers and public schools. The government passed the RH Act in response to the many health issues impacting the country, such as infant mortality, pregnancy-related deaths and a rise in HIVAIDS cases. Moreover, teen pregnancies in the Philippines are common, where 9 of women between the ages of 15 and 19 start child bearing. Lack of knowledge about reproductive health is significantly associated with poverty, especially in regard to overpopulation. Therefore, the RH Act aims to help the population make informed decisions about their reproductive health. It provides more equal access to sex education, while also ensuring that the government reaffirms its commitment to protecting womens reproductive rights, providing accessible family planning information, and hiring skilled maternal health professionals to work in both urban and rural areas of the Philippines. Opposition from the Catholic Church Around 80 of the Philippine population identifies as Roman Catholic. Accordingly, the Catholic Church largely influences the state of sex education in the country. The Catholic Church opposes sex outside of marriage and fears sex education will increase sexual relations. The Catholic Church consequently remains critical of the RH Act, increasing difficulties in putting the RH Act into concrete action. Additionally, the Catholic Church opposes implementing sex education in schools as well as the distribution of contraceptives. The Church prefers to rely on parents to teach their kids about reproductive health. However, many families are either unequipped to do so or will not address the subject directly with their children. The Implementation of the RH Act In an effort to reduce the countrys rate of poverty, Philippine President, Rodrigo Duerte, ordered the government to provide access to free contraceptives for six million women in 2017. Duerte aimed to fulfill unmet family planning needs. This came after a restraining order was placed on the RH Act in 2015. However, the government appealed to lift the restraining order to continue applying the RH Act and addressing issues due to overpopulation. In 2019, Save the Children Philippines an organization with the purpose of supporting Filipino children advocated for the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention bill. The organization also fought for requiring schools to fully integrate Comprehensive Sexuality Education CSE into their curriculum. Save the Children Philippines hopes to combat the countrys high rate of teen pregnancy. CSE in the Philippines includes topics such as consent, sexual violence, contraceptives and others. The bill would also advance access to reproductive health services, further supplementing the goals of the RH Act. Increased Conversation Surrounding Sex Education In addition to greater governmental action, there are various organizations that are working to increase access to sex education and services in the Philippines. The Roots of Health is a nongovernmental organization that provides sex education to women in Palawan and Puerto Princesa. Started in 2009, the founders, Dr. Susan Evangelista and Amina Evangelista Swanepoel, initially provided reproductive health classes at Palawan State University in Puerto Princesa and have since expanded into free clinical services for young women. The Roots of Health provides services that assist with birth, reproductive healthcare, contraceptives, prenatal and postpartum check-ups, and ultrasounds. By 2018, they served 20,000 women and adolescents in the Palawan and Puerto Princesa communities, demonstrating that there is a growing grassroots movement towards reframing reproductive health in the Philippines. Sex education will remain a controversial subject in the Philippines. Nonetheless, it is a developing matter that is expected to evolve with continued conversations between governmental, faith and nongovernmental actors.

To address these health concerns and issues such as overpopulation and high teen pregnancy rates, the Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act (RH Act) in 2012. This act, after a 14-year legislative battle, mandated sex education in public schools for children ages 10-19 and provided government funding for free or subsidized contraceptives at health centers and schools. The RH Act aims to promote informed decisions on reproductive health and reduce health risks associated with poverty, especially in high-population areas.

The implementation of the RH Act has faced significant resistance from the Catholic Church, which holds substantial influence in the predominantly Catholic nation. The Church opposes premarital sex and fears that sex education could encourage sexual activity. Instead, the Church supports parental guidance over school-based sex education. However, this often leaves many young people without adequate information on reproductive health.

Despite resistance, the Philippine government and several organizations continue to support sex education. In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered free access to contraceptives for six million women to meet family planning needs, countering a temporary restraining order placed on the RH Act in 2015. Save the Children Philippines also supported the integration of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in schools through the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention bill, covering topics like consent, contraceptive use, and sexual violence.

Grassroots organizations like Roots of Health have also contributed to increasing access to reproductive health services. Founded in 2009, Roots of Health offers reproductive health education and free clinical services, including birth support, contraceptive access, and prenatal care in communities like Palawan and Puerto Princesa.

While sex education remains a contentious issue, ongoing efforts from the government, NGOs, and advocates are paving the way for its gradual acceptance and potential expansion in the Philippines.","['Philippines', 'Borgen', 'Project', 'Board of Directors', 'Global', 'U', 'S', 'National Security Po', 'Aid', 'Act', 'Congress', 'Congress', 'Blog Magazine', 'Philippines', 'HIV', 'Philippines', 'Reproductive Health Act', 'Philippines', 'Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act', 'RH Act', 'Philippines', 'RH Act', 'HIVAIDS', 'Philippines', 'Act', 'Philippines', 'Catholic', 'Philippine', 'Roman Catholic', 'Catholic', 'Catholic', 'Catholic']","The article discusses the state of sex education in the Philippines, highlighting efforts to address issues such as overpopulation, high rates of teen pregnancy, and the rise of HIV.

However, the Catholic Church, which influences around 80% of the population, strongly opposes the RH Act, particularly sex education in schools and the distribution of contraceptives, fearing it would promote premarital sex.

She had been feeling so great that she hadnt felt the need to bring her husband along to her 20-week scan in late November of last year, a few weeks after they publicly announced the pregnancy.But as the scan went on, St.Michel, who is a chiropractor, started to suspect that her fetuss arms looked a little off. The technician left the room, promising to return with the offices fetal medicine specialist.Anti-choice states arent satisfied. Now they want to punish traveling for abortions Moira DoneganRead moreThen St.Michel waited. And waited. She took a look at the fetuss vitals, still displayed on the screen, and many of the measurements were below 1. St.Michel started to get worried.Around 20 minutes later, the fetal medicine specialist walked in, along with someone else. The specialist introduced herself, and then told St.Michel that her colleague was a genetic counselor.Thats when St.Michel knew something was very, very wrong.The providers recommended that St.Michel call her husband to come to the appointment. After he arrived, they delivered the news the couples fetus had multiple severe genetic and developmental conditions affecting multiple organ systems. If the fetus survived to birth, the baby would immediately need palliative care.St.Michel could consult more specialists, continue the pregnancy a decision that, she later learned, could threaten her health or get an abortion. But she could not get the abortion in the state the procedure is banned in almost all circumstances in Idaho.Basically, all they could do was hand us a sheet of paper with abortion clinics in nearby states, St.Michel told the Guardian in an interview, as she started to cry.St.Michel is one of four women who, on Tuesday, sued Idaho in an attempt to clarify the states abortion ban and allow doctors to perform abortions in cases like hers. Two doctors and the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians have joined the lawsuit, which was brought on the plaintiffs behalf by the Center for Reproductive Rights.Idahos abortion bans have sown confusion, fear, and chaos among the medical community, resulting in grave harms to pregnant patients whose health and safety hang in the balance across the state, the lawsuit alleges. While Idahos abortion bans purport to contain medical exceptions, these so-called exceptions simply do not function as such in practice.Since the overturning of Roe v Wade allowed abortion bans across the country to take effect, doctors in Idaho and other states have said that the bans so-called medical exceptions are worded in opaque, non-medical language that they find impossible to interpret. These exceptions, they say, have forced them to merely watch until patients get sick enough that doctors can legally help.Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights also filed legal actions on Tuesday in Tennessee and Oklahoma, which have enacted near-total abortion bans, demanding specificity on how abortions should be handled in medical emergencies. The center has previously sued over the issue in Texas a judge in that case ruled in favor of the women denied care, but that decision has been paused while the case makes its way to the Texas supreme court.Idaho has one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country, Marc Hearron, the centers senior counsel, said on a press call on Tuesday. While some states allow abortions when peoples health may be at risk, Idaho does not. Under its near-total ban, abortions can only be performed when someones life is threatened.Doctors have started to flee Idaho in droves, and the state could soon find itself a pregnancy care desert. At least 13 reproductive health specialists and four fetal medicine specialists have stopped practicing in Idaho, Dr Emily Corrigan, one of the Idaho doctors involved in the lawsuit, wrote in a June article for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Two rural labor and delivery units have also closed.Our medical community here in Idaho is experiencing catastrophic loss that is going to take decades to fix once we get these laws improved. Were still in a terrible downward spiral right now, Corrigan told reporters on Tuesday. I have hope that the legislature will improve the law. Thats why Im still here. But I have to ask myself every single day if its worth it to stay here.After she got the news about the fetus, St.Michel called out of work for the rest of the week, she told the Guardian. She supports abortion rights, but hadnt thought she would ever need an abortion.Still, she decided she wanted one.At that point, I was feeling baby movement, fetal movement, St.Michel said.

She and her husband brought their toddler daughter with them.While the providers at the clinic were kind, St.Michel felt like she had been forced to suffer alone her husband couldnt come inside, and her care team was back in Idaho. During the appointment, she clutched a grainy ultrasound photo of her fetus, she recalled. It is the only photo she has.Among booking flights, a hotel room and a rental car, and the two-day procedure itself, St.Michel estimates that she and her husband spent between 3,500 and 4,000 ending her pregnancy.Im so, so grateful to them, to the clinic and how much compassion they showed me. But it still wasnt fair, she said That I had to be in that room by myself grieving for the loss of a pregnancy that we wanted so badly.Once they returned to Idaho, St.Michel told many people only that her family had experienced a loss.But months later, she no longer feels like she should keep what happened a secret.It wasnt a shameful thing that we did, she said. It almost feels liberating to share the truth, to share our experience, because I do want people to know how these laws are affecting women across the country.View image in fullscreenSt.Michel with her husband and child. Photograph Courtesy of Jillaine StMichelAfter the abortion, St.Michel and her husband debated whether to try for another baby. St.Michel did get pregnant again, and is due in January 2024, but the experience of being pregnant again is nerve-racking.What if something happens again? What if Im put in this situation again? she wondered. What if this time is worse and my life is at more imminent danger? Where does that leave us?St.Michel and her husband have weighed leaving the state. They love living in Idaho, but she cant ignore the burgeoning political climate in the Republican-dominated state. She wants to give her daughter a more compassionate upbringing and shes not sure if life in Idaho can provide that.St.Michel wears a diamond necklace every day, because diamond is the birthstone for April which would have been her due date. St.Michels daughter is too young to understand what happened, she said, but she sometimes picks up the necklace and asks about the fetus that would have been her sibling.Hopefully, when shes of age to comprehend some of this, things will be different here. Hopefully, this little case will be a thing of the past and Ill be able to say, Because of what happened, we were able to make changes for the better in this state, St.Michel said of her daughter. I hope someday shes proud of me for that.Explore more on these topicsAbortionIdahoReproductive rightsRoe v WadeHealthWomenfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved. dcr","Jillaine St. Michel, a 37-year-old Idaho resident, faced a harrowing experience when her second pregnancy was found to involve severe fetal abnormalities. Her fetus, as an ultrasound revealed, had multiple genetic and developmental issues, and would likely not survive after birth without immediate palliative care. Idaho’s strict abortion ban, which only allows abortions if the mother’s life is in danger, left her with no option for an in-state abortion, despite the significant health risks posed by continuing the pregnancy. St. Michel was advised to seek abortion care out of state and eventually traveled to Washington with her husband and daughter, where she paid between $3,500 and $4,000 for the procedure. The experience was isolating—she could not have her husband present during the procedure, and her Idaho-based healthcare team could not assist her.

St. Michel is now one of four women suing Idaho over its abortion ban, seeking clarification on the law to enable doctors to perform abortions in medically necessary situations. The lawsuit, supported by the Center for Reproductive Rights, argues that Idaho’s ambiguous medical exceptions cause confusion and harm, as healthcare providers struggle to interpret the law and fear legal repercussions. Additionally, Idaho’s restrictive policies are pushing healthcare professionals, particularly reproductive specialists, to leave the state, creating a growing crisis in pregnancy care access.

St. Michel, now expecting another child, lives in anxiety over potential complications that could arise under Idaho’s restrictive laws. She and her husband have considered leaving Idaho due to its political climate, though they love their community. She wears a diamond necklace—a symbol of the pregnancy she lost—and hopes her lawsuit will lead to change, allowing her daughter to grow up in a more compassionate society.","['Idaho', 'The Guardian', '##ralia', 'Guardian', 'Guardian', '##US', 'Guardian', 'Guardian', 'Guardian', '##uard', '##ian', 'Archive', 'Idaho', 'Idaho']","Jillaine St. Michel, a 37-year-old woman from Idaho, is suing the state after being denied an abortion despite her fetus having severe genetic and developmental conditions. During her 20-week ultrasound, the technician grew silent, raising concerns for St. Michel, who soon learned from a specialist that her baby had multiple life-threatening issues. The couple was told they could either continue the pregnancy, risking St. Michel’s health, or seek an abortion outside of Idaho, where the procedure is banned almost entirely. St. Michel, supporting abortion rights but not expecting to need one, decided to travel to Seattle for the procedure, spending $3,500 to $4,000 on travel, accommodation, and medical costs.

St. Michel’s lawsuit is part of a broader effort to challenge Idaho’s extreme abortion bans, which allow abortions only when a person’s life is at risk. Her case, along with those of other women and healthcare providers, argues that the state’s medical exceptions are unclear and impractical, causing harm to both patients and doctors. Idaho’s ban has contributed to a shortage of medical professionals, with many specialists leaving the state. Doctors are also forced to wait until patients’ conditions worsen before they can intervene legally.

St. Michel’s experience has led her to question whether Idaho can offer her family a compassionate future, considering the state’s political climate. Despite the pain of the procedure, she has found empowerment in sharing her story and hopes her legal action will help bring about change for women in Idaho and beyond.",L,

In the face of this global health crisis, Canadas approach, guided by the Feminist International Assistance Policy FIAP, is crucial in ensuring a feminist and human-rights based response to COVID-19 that recognizes the gendered impacts of the pandemic and the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR at this time. Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights encourages the Government of Canada to ensure an integrated response to the virus that includes SRHR, with a particular focus on the neglected areas of SRHR, including abortion access, comprehensive contraceptive care, SRHR for adolescents and youth, including comprehensive sexuality education, and advocacy for SRHR. Sexual and reproductive health and rights underpin gender equality and are pivotal to good health. Evidence shows that when women are denied access to contraception, safe abortion and post-abortion care, maternal mortality rates rise. SRHR services are essential health care and must be accessible. A continued focus on the neglected areas of SRHR must also be part of the global response to COVID-19. In the FIAP, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of access to SRHR for women and girls in its humanitarian response. In the face of a global health crisis, it is time to action the policy and ensure that the needs of women and girls in the most underfunded and overlooked areas are a priority in the global response. A feminist approach to the pandemic includes addressing the unique impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized groups, including women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, people living with disabilities, the working poor, those already living in emergency and humanitarian settings, and many others who face discrimination and barriers to resources, healthcare, and social services. In times of crisis, these inequalities are exacerbated and compounded by new and additional hardships such as greater economic instability, increased gender-based violence GBV, and higher rates of unplanned pregnancies. Further, with women disproportionately represented on the frontlines of the pandemic as health workers and in caregiving role, women have an increased risk of contracting the virus. Why do the neglected areas of SRHR need to be prioritized in the global response to COVID-19? Access to contraception The demand for contraceptives does not change during times of crisis. However, mass disruptions to supply chains and the diversion of supplies to the COVID-19 response create new and additional barriers to access. Supply chain disruption applies to various forms of contraceptives including birth control pills, condoms, and devices, as well as access to emergency contraception. It is imperative that these basic and essential commodities be available and accessible throughout the pandemic. Without decreased access to contraception, it is expected that unplanned pregnancies will increase in the coming months, putting further strain on health systems and increasing demand for abortion. Other ways to increase access to contraception include easing administrative barriers. This includes not requiring a prescription, allowing contraceptives to be prescribed via telemedicine, allowing pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives, and by providing comprehensive cost coverage. In addition to contraception, supply chain disruption could have an effect on other SRHR related drugs, including antiretrovirals for those living with HIV, medical abortion pills, and antibiotics and other medications used to treat sexually transmitted infections. Safe abortion Abortion is an essential and time-sensitive procedure. However, in emergencies, it is often deprioritized, delayed or not offered at all as health systems are stretched thin and supplies and human resources are directed elsewhere. Lockdowns, social distancing and increased barriers to travel during the pandemic make it even harder for pregnant people to access abortion. Unfortunately, where safe abortion is not readily accessible, people will turn to unsafe abortion. Supply chain disruptions can also affect access to medical abortion also known as the abortion pill. A safe method to terminate pregnancy that requires minimal travel or exposure to the virus, many advocates and medical professionals are pushing for expanded access to medical abortion e.g. by removing legal and administrative barrier, allowing its use up to 12 weeks, and allowing prescriptions via telemedicine. SRHR for adolescents and youth The pandemic has forced the closure of schools in many countries, leaving billions of children and youth without access to education. Learning from past humanitarian crises, these interruptions can lead to increased drop-out rates, which disproportionately affects adolescent girls by furthering gender gaps in education and leading to increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy, and early and forced marriage. Outside of school, the caregiving burdens on young women and adolescents may increase. They may also lose access to health and hygiene services or products that are often offered through schools. The closure of schools also means that young people are being denied life-saving comprehensive sexuality education CSE. CSE is a key intervention to prevent childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence. When delivered properly, CSE can address persistent stigma, prejudice, and discrimination against the LGBTQI2S community and reduce homophobic and transphobic violence. This is critical knowledge that enables children and youth to keep themselves healthy and safe and should be accessible to all, even in times of crisis. Advocacy for SRHR Communities must be central in the COVID-19 response. Local mobilizers and organizations best know their communitys needs, including the unique needs of women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, and other vulnerable groups. Feminist, womens rights and youth organizations should be supported and meaningfully included in policymaking at all levels in the response to COVID-19, and in program design, delivery and monitoring. Amid government efforts to control movement and limit the spread of the virus, there has been an uptick in surveillance, censorship, and criminalization, putting civil liberties at risk. Human rights defenders drawing attention to these abuses, including health care workers, journalists, and other whistleblowers must be protected. Another threat to access to SRHR includes ideological attacks by policymakers using the pandemic to push through laws and restrictions that violate human rights. This includes everything from abortion restrictions to attacks on trans rights. As we face this unprecedented global health crisis, we urge Canada to maintain its global feminist leadership and commitment to SRHR in its international assistance. This means a continued focus on the most neglected areas of SRHR at a time pf heightened inequality to ensure uninterrupted access to these essential and lifesaving SRHR services.

Under the guidance of Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP), this approach would support a gender-sensitive and human rights-based response to the pandemic. This integration is crucial for addressing the pandemic’s gendered impacts, which disproportionately affect women, girls, LGBTQI2S individuals, and marginalized communities facing increased barriers to healthcare and essential services.

Key SRHR areas highlighted include access to contraception, safe abortion, and youth-focused sexual education. Disruptions in supply chains due to the pandemic have severely limited access to contraceptives, emergency contraception, and other essential medications. Action Canada urges policy changes to streamline contraceptive access, including telemedicine prescriptions and eased pharmacy restrictions. This is necessary to prevent the likely increase in unplanned pregnancies and associated health risks.

The brief also stresses the importance of maintaining access to safe abortion services during the pandemic, as delays and restrictions push people toward unsafe alternatives. To address this, it recommends allowing medical abortion via telemedicine and removing legal barriers to expand safe abortion access.

For adolescents and youth, the pandemic has limited access to comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) due to school closures. CSE is essential for preventing sexual exploitation, violence, and early marriage, particularly for young girls who are at increased risk due to higher dropout rates during crises. Action Canada underscores the role of CSE in educating youth on gender equality, LGBTQI2S rights, and sexual health.

Action Canada advocates for community involvement in Canada’s global COVID-19 response, highlighting the importance of supporting local feminist organizations and protecting human rights defenders facing increased surveillance and censorship. The brief warns against policymakers who use the pandemic to restrict SRHR or impose ideologically driven limitations, such as abortion restrictions and attacks on transgender rights.

In conclusion, Action Canada calls for sustained support for SRHR in Canada’s COVID-19 response, focusing on vulnerable groups and ensuring uninterrupted access to essential SRHR services during this time of heightened inequality. This comprehensive response is framed as crucial to upholding Canada’s commitment to gender equality and human rights in the global pandemic response.","['Canada', 'Action Canada', 'Sexual', 'Health and', 'English', 'English', 'Canada', '##D', 'Action Canada', 'Health and Rights', 'CO', '##D', '19', 'Canada', 'Canada', 'Feminist International Assistance Policy FIA', 'CO', '##D', '19', 'Action Canada', 'Sexual Health and Rights', 'Government of Canada', 'Canada', 'LGBT']","In the context of the global COVID-19 crisis, Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights urges the Government of Canada to integrate Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) into its pandemic response. The organization’s call aligns with Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP), which emphasizes a feminist, human-rights-based approach. This approach recognizes the gendered impacts of COVID-19, highlighting the critical need for access to SRHR services, especially in neglected areas like abortion, contraceptive care, adolescent health, and sexuality education.

SRHR is integral to gender equality and good health, and disruptions in healthcare systems during the pandemic have exacerbated risks, such as rising maternal mortality due to lack of access to contraception and safe abortion. In emergencies, such services are often deprioritized or inaccessible, leading people to seek unsafe alternatives. For example, disruptions in the supply chain have affected the availability of contraceptives, medications for HIV, and abortion pills, further complicating healthcare access.

Moreover, the pandemic has caused school closures, depriving young people, particularly adolescent girls, of education, including crucial comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). The lack of CSE increases their vulnerability to sexual exploitation, unplanned pregnancies, and early marriage. Furthermore, gender-based violence (GBV) has surged as women, often on the frontlines as caregivers, face greater risks of contracting the virus.

Action Canada stresses the need for increased access to contraception, advocating for measures such as easier prescription processes and telemedicine services. In addition, they highlight the importance of supporting feminist, youth, and women’s rights organizations in policymaking and response efforts. These groups are essential in addressing the unique needs of marginalized communities, including LGBTQI2S persons, people with disabilities, and those living in emergency settings.

To ensure a comprehensive, inclusive response, Action Canada calls on Canada to maintain its leadership in global SRHR efforts, ensuring uninterrupted access to essential services during the pandemic, particularly in underserved regions. They also warn against ideological attacks on SRHR during this time, urging the protection of human rights defenders and advocating against laws that restrict abortion access and other SRHR protections.",L,

Bill ClarkCQ Roll Call file photo By Sandhya Raman Posted January 22, 2020 at 600am Facebook Twitter Email Reddit Groups pushing for the advancement of abortion rights and those looking to limit the procedure have an ambitious agenda starting this week, foreshadowing a year that could be critical for advocates on both sides of the debate.In two months, the Supreme Court will hear its first major abortion case since 2016, and both sides are revving up for a major presidential election. States are also eyeing a number of new reproductive health bills as their legislatures come back into session.Lawmakers urge Supreme Court to reexamine abortion decisionsA flurry of legislation timed around the Jan. 22 anniversary of the landmark 1973 abortion rights case Roe v. Wade and the largest annual anti-abortion rally, known as the March for Life, is typical in most years. But with a split Congress and impeachment proceedings pending in the Republican-controlled Senate, this years activity will focus more on motivating supporters to prepare for upcoming fights over state policies, court cases and elections.Kristan Hawkins, president of the anti-abortion Students for Life of America group, envisions renewed energy beginning this week, stemming in part from the 2020 campaign season.Theres a general feeling that most people would agree that this is going to be a pivotal year when we talk about abortion in our country, she said. Loading the player. Upcoming events More than 100,000 abortion opponents are expected to rally for the March for Life on Jan. 24, with a 3,000-person conference scheduled the following day aimed at training abortion opponents to mobilize. In recent years, the president and vice president spoke at the March for Life. Top administration officials are expected to make an appearance this year as well.Last year, the march was timed for the week of a Senate procedural vote to codify a ban on taxpayer-funded abortion, the announcement of a newly formed Senate Pro-Life Caucus and a letter from President Donald Trump to Speaker Nancy Pelosi promising to veto any abortion rights legislation.Anti-abortion advocates want to see movement on their key policy priority legislation that they argue would protect an infant who survives an attempted abortion.Grassroots groups prepare for a post-Roe v. Wade AmericaJeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, expects the call to action this year to be related to a House discharge petition to require a vote on this bill. Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, who sponsored the House version, is slated to speak at the march, as are other GOP lawmakers and Louisiana Democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson, who wrote the law that the Supreme Court will hear in March.Another priority, according to Hawkins, is targeting Planned Parenthood funding.I know several people who have reached out to various people at the administration to talk about debarment of Planned Parenthood, she said.The Department of Health and Human Services is able to temporarily block federal funds to an organization in cases of fraud or other illegal activity. State and court battles Legislative and legal action on both abortion bans and the expansion of abortion rights is also expected to heat up.In 2019, seven states passed near-total abortion bans, none of which is in effect because of litigation. The ACLU said two of those cases, Mississippi and Missouri, could see appeals court arguments in the next couple of months.The million-dollar question is whether the Supreme Court will step in to review one of these cases, said Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Its too late for that to happen this term. So the earliest wed really be looking at is 2021, and its unclear whether the Supreme Court has the appetite to jump into that question right away.Jessica Arons, senior advocacy and policy counsel for reproductive freedom at the American Civil Liberties Union, also sees state policy changes as an often-overlooked issue.While a high-stakes showdown will be playing out at the Supreme Court, we should not take our eyes off of what is happening in the states, she told reporters last week. Already, bills that would ban abortion from the earliest days of pregnancy, like those passed in Georgia and Alabama last year, have been introduced in 10 states, with more likely to be filed in the coming days. This year, there is a genuine risk that at least five more abortion bans could be enacted, Arons said.Arons and other abortion rights supporters are also watching court cases besides the Supreme Court case in March, which will determine whether a Louisiana law that would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital can go into effect.The ACLU is watching at least two other types of cases that could make their way to the high court next year. One type is cases targeting a method of abortion known as dilation and evacuation. Laws in Kentucky, Arkansas and Ohio were blocked by lower courts but have been appealed.The other type challenges restrictions that would ban abortions based on a reason, such as a fetal anomaly. In March, the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on an Ohio law. Election 2020 Both sides are doubling down on grassroots efforts to energize voters who share their beliefs about abortion.A majority of Americans do not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned, according to a poll released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. About 91 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents do not want the decision to be reversed, while 57 percent of Republicans do want it overturned. However, only 6 percent of Democrats and 7 percent of Republicans consider reproductive health to be their top campaign issue, the poll found.Abortion may get more attention this year, though, in states like Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Michigan, which might have ballot initiatives this cycle that could roll back abortion rights.Progressive groups are also on the offense, building on the success of enacting state legislation in places like New York last year. For instance, Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and others are backing a Massachusetts bill that would allow access to abortion later in pregnancy and loosen parental consent restrictions for minors.Last week, Planned Parenthood announced a new voter program, We Decide 2020, that provides voter information about candidates reproductive health stances. The new program launched with a five-figure digital buy in battleground states. Planned Parenthood previously announced plans to spend 45 million on this election.Our country is at a crossroads, but now its time for us to reclaim our power, said Jenny Lawson, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes. In 2020, were fighting back and electing reproductive champions up and down the ballot because our futures depend on it.On the other side of the debate, Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, announced Friday that it would dramatically expand its grassroots efforts. Volunteers were already talking to voters in Arizona, Florida and North Carolina but also will be targeting Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Theyve also increased their budget to 52 million this cycle.Mallory Quigley, national spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PACs independent expenditure campaign, said they will also target traditional Democratic voter groups.Our focused, battle-tested voter outreach method will ensure we reach the voters who can provide President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates the winning margin, she said.You may not always agree with what the president tweets out, Hawkins said. You may not agree with every policy he has, or any other politician, but you always know when we vote, we think about what is the most pressing issue. You have to vote for the candidate thats going to do the most to limit abortion.

Wade approaches, the abortion debate intensifies, with advocacy groups from both sides preparing for a critical year in 2020. The enactment of Texas’ six-week abortion ban has fueled activism, coinciding with the Supreme Court’s upcoming review of a Louisiana law on abortion provider hospital privileges. Both sides anticipate the importance of the 2020 election and have ramped up grassroots and legislative efforts.

Key events include the March for Life rally and an anti-abortion training conference, expected to gather over 100,000 participants. Anti-abortion advocates aim to advance legislation focused on protecting infants who survive abortion attempts and seek to defund Planned Parenthood, which could lose federal funding if accused of illegal activity. Additionally, state-level restrictions and new reproductive health bills are in focus, with several states likely to pass more abortion bans this year.

Court battles continue, with cases in Mississippi and Missouri potentially advancing to higher courts. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are monitoring new laws that challenge Roe v. Wade’s protections, including restrictions on abortion methods and bans based on fetal anomalies. In the election arena, both sides aim to mobilize voters. Polls show strong public support for Roe v. Wade, with a majority of Democrats and independents opposing its overturn. Yet, while abortion isn’t the top campaign priority for most voters, the issue is gaining traction in key battleground states with ballot initiatives and candidate endorsements.

Progressive organizations like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are backing state initiatives to expand abortion access, such as Massachusetts’ proposal to allow later-term abortions and ease parental consent for minors. Planned Parenthood has also launched a voter initiative, We Decide 2020, aimed at informing voters about candidates’ reproductive health stances. Conversely, anti-abortion groups, led by the Susan B. Anthony List, have expanded outreach in swing states, focusing on traditional Democratic demographics to bolster support for President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates.

With both sides significantly increasing their campaign budgets, the 2020 election is set to be pivotal for abortion rights in America, reflecting deep divides and the potential for sweeping policy changes at both the state and federal levels.","['Roe v', 'Wade', 'Congress White House', 'Defense', '##tech Health Care Technology Transportation', 'CQ', 'Capitol In', 'RollC', 'RollCall', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Texas', 'Bill Clark', 'Sandhya Raman', 'Supreme Court', 'Supreme Court', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'March for Life', 'Congress', 'Republican', 'Senate', 'Kristan Hawkins', 'Students for Life', 'America', 'Life', 'Life']","The article discusses the intensifying activism surrounding abortion policy as the anniversary of Roe v. Wade approaches, particularly in light of the ongoing Texas abortion ban and upcoming Supreme Court cases. Both pro-abortion rights groups and anti-abortion advocates are gearing up for a critical year in 2020, with a major abortion case slated for the Supreme Court in March and state legislatures considering new reproductive health bills.

Key entities involved in the abortion debate include advocacy groups like Students for Life of America and Planned Parenthood, as well as political figures and institutions such as Kristan Hawkins, Jeanne Mancini, Bill Clark, and the U.S. Supreme Court. The March for Life event, an annual anti-abortion rally, is set for January 24, 2020, with key speeches expected from lawmakers like Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner and Louisiana State Sen. Katrina Jackson.

The article highlights that the main focus for anti-abortion groups is on passing laws to protect infants surviving abortions and defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood. The ACLU and other abortion rights organizations are tracking several cases, including those challenging abortion bans in states like Mississippi and Missouri, and restrictions on abortion methods like dilation and evacuation.

On the electoral front, abortion policy is expected to feature prominently in key states like Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, and Michigan, where ballot initiatives may seek to roll back abortion rights. Nationally, Planned Parenthood Votes has launched a voter program to influence the 2020 election, while the Susan B. Anthony List is significantly expanding its grassroots efforts to target voters in swing states to support pro-life candidates.

The article concludes by noting a major public opinion divide, with a majority of Americans opposing the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but acknowledging that abortion policy remains a divisive issue in the 2020 election.",C,

Over the past two weeks, more than 100 posters have been distributed in the streets of Szczecin, considered one of Polands most liberal cities, as part of a project by the TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art.On 22 October, Poland's constitutional court ruled that abortion is illegal even in cases where there are severe foetal abnormalities. Almost all of the country's 1,000 legal terminations a year are carried out for this reason under the new law, abortions can only be carried out in instances of rape, incest and when the mother's life is at risk. Andrzeh GolcKruger tells The Art Newspaper she has been riveted by the hugely brave protests in Poland, compelling her to revisit her poster project from many years ago. The US artist says The urgent and brave protesting of marginalised, disempowered and newly empowered bodies is an insistent threat to the dominant and extremist choreographies of religion, power, and politics in Poland. The brazen hypocrisy of the Church and its predictable fist bumping with the political right make for a grotesque dance of male bonding and resolute abuse of power.Kruger originally made the graphic work of a woman with a bisected face for the Womens March in Washington DC in 1989, which had been organised because the Republicans were trying to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 ruling which made abortion legal in the US.Two years later, in 1991, when womens rights were also under attack in Poland, it was translated into Polish and 500 posters were distributed throughout Warsaw. The images only lasted one weekend before being torn down or covered up. Six months later, a Polish feminist group agreed to distribute the posters once more, pasting the works in hard-to-reach spots and ensuring the image became part of Polish history. Andrzej GolcMilada Slizinska, then the curator of the Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw, was instrumental in bringing Krugers campaign to Poland in the 1990s. Speaking to the Gentlewoman magazine earlier this year, Slizinska describes how womens rights were being eroded. She says When Solidarity came to power in 1989, all of a sudden, the rules against sexual education and abortion became stronger and stronger. The political climate had unexpectedly turned against womens rights, so I asked Barbara to work with us. This is where our problems started.Slizinska recalls how the museum's budget came from the minister of culture, and our director was too scared to fund the printing and distribution of Barbaras poster. Furthermore, Kruger refused to let the American embassy pay for her flight, so Slizinska booked the US artist to give a lecture in Warsaw and was able to pay for her that way. Stanislaw Ruksza, the director of TRAFO, also remembers the impact of Krugers project. Back then, I was a teenager, but I remember the posters were one of the first works in the Polish public space of the transformation era that got a reaction from passers-by. It was the beginning ofor perhaps an impulse forfurther important public works in Poland, he says. Ruksza notes how Krugers posters had a lasting impact on Polish artists during the late 1990s including Krzysztof Wodiczko, Artur Zmijewski, Katarzyna Kozyra and Pawel Althamerall of whom have provided a powerful commentary on the Polish reality and, frequently, openly confronted the conservative discourse.As for the seeming lack of progress over the past 30 years, Kruger says she is not at all surprised that the struggle for womens reproductive freedom is constant and ongoing. She adds The need to control minds and bodies and to destroy difference has been horrifically acted out across centuries and continents. Contestations around gender, race, and class loom larger now than ever.The emergence of Donald Trump in the US signals a consolidation of the forces of rage, shaming, and revenge and speaks not only to the gathering global wave of autocratic rule but also to the failures of some of the lefts weak rhetorical skills and pathetic inability to read the room, Kruger says.And added to these challenges and inequities is the horrific fact that we are living and dying amidst the looming tragedies of a planetary pandemic in which some are more insulated than others.

Originally created in 1989 for the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., the work was made in response to threats against Roe v. Wade and features a bisected image of a woman’s face, symbolizing the struggle for women’s rights. The poster first appeared in Poland in 1991, during another period of conservative opposition to women’s reproductive rights, but was quickly torn down, with a Polish feminist group later redistributing it in more inaccessible locations to preserve its impact.

Now, nearly 30 years later, TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art has reintroduced Kruger’s poster to the streets of Szczecin in response to Poland’s 2020 constitutional court ruling that bans abortion even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. This new law restricts abortion to cases of rape, incest, or risk to the mother’s life, a decision that has triggered widespread protests, especially in urban, liberal areas like Szczecin. Kruger supports the protesters, highlighting the ongoing, global fight against patriarchal forces that seek control over marginalized bodies.

Milada Slizinska, a key figure in bringing Kruger’s work to Poland in the early 90s, recalls the difficulties faced, including censorship from government-funded institutions and a lack of financial support. Kruger’s work has since left a lasting impact on Polish public art, influencing notable artists like Krzysztof Wodiczko and Katarzyna Kozyra, who have critiqued Poland’s conservative climate through their work.

Kruger comments on the persistence of restrictive policies around reproductive rights, seeing it as part of a broader struggle for bodily autonomy that spans gender, race, and class issues. She also draws parallels with the political climate in the U.S., pointing to a global trend toward autocratic governance and failures of liberal movements to effectively counter this. Kruger’s poster thus remains a powerful symbol in Poland’s ongoing fight for women’s rights and broader social justice.","['Barbara Krugers', 'Your Body is', 'Battleground', 'Poland', 'Van Gogh', 'Van Gogh', '##Barbara Krugers', 'Your Body is', 'Battleground', 'Poland', '##nny Shaw', '##Barbara Kruger', 'Your Body is', 'Battleground', 'Szczecin', '##ej', 'Golc', 'Polish', 'Barbara Krugers', 'Your Body is a Battleground', 'European', 'Szczecin', 'Poland', 'TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'US', 'Poland']","Barbara Kruger’s iconic 1989 “Your Body is a Battleground” poster has resurfaced in Poland amid growing protests against the country’s restrictive abortion laws. The poster, which features a bisected image of a woman’s face, was originally created for the Women’s March in Washington DC to oppose the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. In 1991, it was translated into Polish and displayed in Warsaw, but was quickly removed. Now, in 2020, more than 100 copies of the poster have been distributed across Szczecin as part of an art project by the TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art.

The reappearance of Kruger’s artwork coincides with intense protests following Poland’s constitutional court ruling on October 22, 2020, which banned abortion even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. Abortion in Poland is now only permitted in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. Kruger, reflecting on the protests in Poland, expressed her admiration for the courage of the demonstrators and criticized the alliance between the Polish church and political right, accusing them of perpetuating a “grotesque dance of male bonding” that abuses power.

Kruger’s poster was first displayed in Poland during a time when women’s rights were similarly under threat in the 1990s. Despite political opposition, including difficulty securing funding from the Ministry of Culture and the US embassy, the posters were distributed by feminist groups, making a significant cultural impact. Milada Slizinska, the curator who helped bring the project to Poland, recalled how the political environment shifted against women’s rights after the Solidarity movement came to power in 1989.

Kruger notes that the ongoing struggle for women’s reproductive rights is unsurprising, given the long history of efforts to control bodies and minds. She also links these issues to broader global political trends, including the rise of autocratic rule and the deepening inequalities revealed by the pandemic.

The impact of Kruger’s posters on Polish art and public discourse in the late 1990s was significant, inspiring artists like Krzysztof Wodiczko, Artur Zmijewski, and others, who used their work to challenge conservative narratives.",L,
Abortion 'practically banned in Turkey',"Abortion 'practically banned in Turkey' Turkey's own independent gazette Podcast Women Economy Human Rights Politics Education Columns Galleries Videos Abortion is practically banned in Turkey, an academic who has been working on the issue has said, adding that majority of the public hospitals don't carry out abortion surgeries. According to Sedef Erkmen, public hospitals in 53 provinces don't carry out the said surgeries upon women's wills, while certain doctors do so in a limited amount of hospitals in the remaining provinces. Sunday August 16 2020 0209 pm rfan Aktan DUVARAbortion is practically banned in Turkey, an academic who has been working on the issue has said, adding that majority of the public hospitals don't carry out abortion surgeries. Sedef Erkmen, who recently published a book on the subject, told Duvar that the anti-abortion practices that have been systematically implemented since 2012 turned into a de facto ban. According to Erkmen, public hospitals in 53 provinces don't carry out the said surgeries upon women's wills, while certain doctors do so in a limited amount of hospitals in the remaining provinces. Sedef Erkmen.Abortion became legal in Turkey in 1983 following a years-long ban, but the de facto ban began under the ruling Justice and Development Party AKP, whose leader President Recep Tayyip Erdoan has deemed it ""murder"" in the past. Erkmen said that on-demand abortion is legal for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, but women face numerous obstacles in practice.Turkey's top court orders state to pay 100,000 liras over denial of abortion to rape victim""Since the understanding that abortion is murder is imposed by the government, some doctors don't carry out surgeries despite it being against the law. They know that they will be protected by the government if women complain about it,"" Erkmen said. ""It's not easy for women to take the issue to courts. Besides, women are usually referred to private hospitals from public ones,"" she added. No access to birth control, high prices lead to abortionsErkmen noted that one of the leading factors that women seek abortions is the difficulty in accessing birth control methods.""Because the state doesn't make it easy for people to access birth control methods and because they are very expensive, women, especially impoverished ones, seek abortion. The high prices lead to unwanted pregnancies, but they also face difficulties in abortion so the problem keeps growing,"" Erkmen said. If a practice is legal, it also has to be accessible, Erkmen said, adding that abortion surgeries are also very expensive in private hospitals. Erkmen cited a study by Kadir Has University conducted in 2016, which showed that only 7.8 percent of 431 state hospitals are carrying out abortions upon will. Some 11.8 percent of the state hospitals are not conducting the said surgeries, according to the study. Ankara police attack and detain women rallying for Istanbul ConventionErkmen said that the practical ban on abortions can't be explained with the AKP's population policies. ""It can be seen that the AKP has been using anti-abortion discourse as part of its efforts to control women in all ways,"" she said, adding that the government's discourse on family values dates back to 2007. ""The family is very important for the AKP. That's why it had to choose policies that protect the family instead of women. For it to reach its 'ideal society,' women need to be a part of a family,"" Erkmen also said. Women use methods that endanger their lives Saying that women who can't access abortion choose methods that endanger their lives, Erkmen noted that women have to get a written permission from their husbands for an operation. ""For single women, the biggest fear is to be going under record. Health officials visit you at your house if you find out that you're pregnant with a test at a doctor's office,"" she said. According to Erkmen, Turkey needs to allow certain medication that leads to miscarriage at home. ""The World Health Organization recommends this medicine and it's known to be safe until the 10th week of pregnancy. Only two to three in every 100,000 women need surgical intervention after taking the pill. It's being used in France since 1992 and the death rate is zero,"" she said. ""A study in Turkey showed that 92 percent of women would prefer to use it if necessary since abortion also has psychological consequences,"" Erkmen added.

Close Homepage Categories Human rights Life style Science tech Urban beat Pages About us Privacy policy","In Turkey, while abortion is technically legal within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, it is nearly inaccessible in practice, especially in public hospitals. Academic Sedef Erkmen explains that the Turkish government, led by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has increasingly promoted anti-abortion views, leading to a de facto ban. Although abortion was legalized in 1983, recent years have seen a shift in policy; since 2012, access has been restricted as many doctors refuse to perform the procedure, even though they legally should, because they are often backed by government support. Women seeking abortions often face referral to private hospitals where procedures are costly, or they must resort to dangerous alternatives. The lack of access to affordable birth control exacerbates this issue, especially for impoverished women.

A 2016 study by Kadir Has University revealed that only 7.8% of public hospitals perform abortions upon request. Erkmen argues that the AKP’s policies emphasize traditional family roles over women’s rights, reflecting an ideology that values family structures as central to the “ideal society.” This policy results in further restrictions, such as requiring written permission from husbands for married women or fears of being documented for single women seeking medical advice on pregnancy.

Erkmen also advocates for allowing safe, medically-approved abortion pills, as used in other countries, to reduce the need for surgical intervention and decrease health risks.","['Turkey', 'Turkey', 'Turkey', 'Sedef Erkmen', 'Akt', '##U', 'Turkey', 'Sedef Erkmen', 'Duvar', 'Erkmen', '##de', 'E', '##men', 'Turkey', 'Justice and Development Party AKP', 'Recep Tayyip Erdoan', 'Erkmen', 'Turkey']","Abortion in Turkey has become effectively banned, with significant limitations on its accessibility despite its legality. Sedef Erkmen, an academic and author on the issue, revealed that public hospitals in 53 provinces do not perform abortions upon women’s request, and only a few hospitals in remaining provinces offer the service. While abortion was legalized in Turkey in 1983, systematic anti-abortion practices since 2012, particularly under the rule of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), have led to a de facto ban. AKP’s leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has referred to abortion as “murder.”

Abortion is legally allowed up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, but in practice, women face many obstacles, such as doctors refusing to perform abortions due to government-imposed anti-abortion views. Erkmen highlighted that doctors are often shielded by the government if women file complaints, and it is difficult for women to pursue legal action. Many are instead referred to private hospitals, where abortion costs are high.

Erkmen also pointed out that limited access to birth control, especially for low-income women, leads to unwanted pregnancies, further exacerbating the demand for abortions. She cited a 2016 study by Kadir Has University which found that only 7.8% of state hospitals provide abortion services. The practical ban, Erkmen argued, is not a direct result of the AKP’s population control policies but is instead part of the party’s broader agenda to exert control over women, especially through their promotion of traditional family values.

Moreover, women unable to access legal abortions often resort to dangerous methods. For example, women must obtain written consent from their husbands for the procedure, and single women fear being recorded, which complicates access to health care. Erkmen suggested that allowing certain medications for miscarriage at home could offer a safer, more accessible alternative, as recommended by the World Health Organization.

Erkmen concluded that the state’s failure to make abortion accessible, despite its legality, is a significant issue affecting women’s rights and health in Turkey.",L,

Todays vote by Senate Republicans yet again proves they have no interest in protecting Americans access to health care or ensuring people with pre-existing conditions are able to keep their health care in the midst of a public health crisis, said HRC President Alphonso David. While people are suffering across the country, instead of offering aid, McConnell and Senate Republicans are rushing to confirm Amy Coney Barrett a Supreme Court nominee who could deal a fatal blow to people maintaining their basic health care--especially protections for people with preexisting conditions--LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights. The last four years have been an assault on equality, health care and the civil rights of millions across the country -- an assault led by Donald Trump, Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell. We must Unite for Equality and hold them accountable this November at the ballot box. Should the ACA be eliminated, more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose their protections and guaranteed access to coverage, including those with employer-sponsored insurance who could once again face annual or lifetime limits on care. Tens of millions of people could lose coverage during a global pandemic as COVID-19 would qualify as a pre-existing condition. Last week, HRC responded to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Coney Barrett has demonstrated hostility toward LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, and her work and rulings have raised significant concerns to her approach to Civil Rights law. She has criticized the ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Actwhich has helped millions attain quality, affordable healthcareand expressed opinions that suggest she would strike down the law. Days after the election, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an argument in a case that could undermine this transformative piece of legislation, and with it the healthcare security of more than one hundred million people, including a disproportionate number of LGBTQ people. HRC published a research brief outlining the particular health and economic risks faced by the LGBTQ community during the COVID-19 public health crisis. Many in the LGBTQ community are uniquely vulnerable, as they are more likely to work jobs in highly affected industries, often with more exposure andor higher economic sensitivity to the COVID-19 crisis, are less likely to have health coverage and are more likely to smoke and have chronic illnesses like asthma.

This action occurred amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when access to healthcare was critically important. HRC President Alphonso David expressed that Republicans were prioritizing the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett over addressing health care issues, despite the ongoing crisis.

The Supreme Court was set to hear a case soon that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which protects over 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. If the ACA were eliminated, many could lose access to coverage, especially those with employer-sponsored insurance or chronic conditions like asthma. Furthermore, COVID-19 itself could be classified as a pre-existing condition, exacerbating the crisis.

Barrett’s nomination raised concerns due to her history of opposition to LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights. Her stance on the ACA and civil rights law has been perceived as threatening to the health and economic security of millions, particularly LGBTQ individuals who face unique vulnerabilities during the pandemic. The HRC emphasized the need for accountability, urging citizens to vote against leaders who continue to undermine health care access and equality.","['Mitch McConnell', 'Senate Republicans', 'Americans', 'Human Rights Campaign', 'Human Rights Campaign', 'Human Rights Campaign', 'Equality Magazine', 'Mitch McConnell', 'Senate Republicans', 'Americans', 'HRC', 'Lucas Acosta', 'PoliticsToday', 'Human Rights Campaign', 'U', 'S', 'Senate', 'Americans', 'Trump', 'Pence', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Senate', 'Republicans', 'Americans', 'HRC', 'Alphonso David', 'McConnell', 'Senate', 'Republicans', 'Amy Coney Barrett', 'Supreme Court', 'LGBTQ', 'Donald Trump', 'Mike Pence', 'Mitch McConnell', 'Unit', 'Equality', '##A', 'Americans', 'CO', '##RC', 'Barrett', 'United', 'States', 'Supreme Court', 'Con', 'Barrett', 'LGBT']","The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) criticized Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell, for their continued efforts to strip health care protections from Americans, particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony ‚Ä¢ Florida Phoenix,"DeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony Florida Phoenix HOME NEWS Education Health Politics Law Environment Culture Society Working The Economy Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 1231 News Story Culture SocietyFL Legislature 2022Politics Law DeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony By Michael Moline - April 14, 2022 1231 pm Republican State Rep. Erin Grall, House sponsor of HB 5, the 15-week abortion ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis background signed the bill into law April 14, 2022. Credit DeSantis Facebook page. Gov. Ron DeSantis went to church Thursday to sign a 15-week abortion ban into law during a ceremony bearing many of the accoutrements of a worship service. We are there to defend those who cant defend themselves, the governor told an enthusiastic crowd at the Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee. This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation, he said. The American Civil Liberties Union immediately promised to challenge the law in court. Make no mistake If this abortion ban goes into effect, it would have devastating consequences for pregnant people, especially those who are not able to afford to travel out of state in search of the essential health care they need, legislative director Kara Gross said in a written statement. Nobody should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. We will take swift legal action to protect Floridians rights and defend against this cruel attack on our bodily autonomy. The new law HB 5 bans abortions after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest, although they would be allowed in cases of severe fetal abnormality. Abortion rights advocates argue that it is blatantly unconstitutional under existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents including Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The 15-week ban in Florida takes effect on July 1. That gives the justices time to rule in a constitutional challenge to a similar law from Mississippi before they take their summer break around the end of June. That courts new Republican supermajority is widely expected to uphold the Mississippi statute, either by overruling those precedents or trimming them into oblivion. Florida Constitution The Florida Supreme Court is also in play here. It ruled in 1989 that an abortion-consent law for minors was unconstitutional because it violated privacy provisions in the state Constitution. The new state Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, is far more conservative than the court that upheld the right to privacy and hasnt by shy about overturning its own precedents. A large crowd attended the signing of Floridas 15-week abortion bill. The law goes into affect July 1. April 14, 2022. The bill-signing event in Central Florida included a large, enthusiastic crowd that broke into cheers and waved signs saying, Pro Life. It featured witness testimony from women whod undergone abortions and regretted it and others whod refused abortions and did not regret it. The ceremony stood in stark contrast to two years ago, when DeSantis announced that hed signed an abortion parental-consent bill via a press release that tucked it among 14 separate pieces of legislation while holding a public bill-signing ceremony for two water-quality measures. On Thursday, there was much talk of prayer, including from Erin Grall, a Republican representing Indian River and part of St. Lucie counties who sponsored the legislation in the House. She thanked people who prayed for her as the legislation advanced during the recent legislative session and those who are praying every day to end the horrific abortions that plague our country. Grall, an attorney, referred to those U.S. Supreme Court precedents during the bill-signing ceremony. The reality of the Roe decision is that men on the Supreme Court proclaimed that women, in order to achieve equality with men, must be able to kill their own children. As a woman, I refuse to accept such a perverse version of equality, Grall said. no abortions Sen. Kelli Stargel, Senate sponsor of the 15-week abortion ban. Credit Danielle J. Brown. Senate sponsor Kelli Stargel, representing portions of Lake and Polk counties, remarked that were looking at the potential of Roe v. Wade being overturned, adding, hopefully, in the future, there will be no abortions. Also on hand were Senate President Wilton Simpson and House Speaker Chris Sprowls, who called DeSantis the most pro-life governor in America. So, too, was Simone Marstiller, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, which regulates abortion clinics. Sprowls continued Like many of you, I believe that life is a gift from God. And, as I look out into this audience, I see many familiar faces who have been warriors on the front lines of the life movement, whether it is ministering to young women, whether it is helping them as they give birth to their child in pregnancy centers across this state. You have been a part of this as much as every single legislator here and for that we are very grateful. Reaction was swift. Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried, running in the Democratic primary to oppose DeSantis this fall, issued a written statement This law is a despicable and disgusting assault on women. Its an insult to our dignity and our ability to make these deeply personal decisions about our own lives, and it will have a devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of women across Florida, Fried said. Hypocrisy The hypocrisy of Republicans who love to brag about how free our state is while pushing a law that will literally force women and girls to give birth is absolutely outrageous. This law is a direct attack on womens constitutional rights, and its cruel, extreme, and inhumane, Fried said. On Twitter, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, also in the Democratic primary, called the law an unconstitutional attack on women that strips away their reproductive freedom. Women should make decisions about their own bodies, not governors. Id veto this bill and any attempt to restrict the right to choose. Full stop. State Sen. Annette Taddeo, another Democrat running for governor, issued her own written statement. We are less free today than before the session started, it reads. As Latin American countries like Colombia are moving forward and expanding access to health care, were moving backward in Florida. Gov. DeSantis has just signed into law an extreme bill that was made even crueler by the rejections to provide exemptions for victims of rape, human trafficking, and incest. Florida Sen. Lauren Book. WFSU photo Not moderate or fair Lauren Book of Broward County, leader of the Senate Democrats, said DeSantis had forced the women of Florida back 50 years, before Roe. This is not a moderate or fair bill if a woman or girl must live with the consequence of someone elses actions, revictimized by the decisions of Floridas right-wing GOP, she said in a written statement. Without access to safe and legal procedures, a womans life and her liberty are severely endangered. This is nothing more than an authoritarian move by Florida Republicans. Florida will never be free while lawmakers turn a blind eye to womens rights, victims rights, and to the decent and basic needs of our citizens. However, Andrew Shirvell, founder and executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn, offered praise. This truly historic law will annually save an estimated 5,000 unborn children from being murdered here in Florida via brutal late-term abortions. Florida Voice for the Unborn anticipates that any legal challenges to the legislation whether brought in federal or state court will ultimately be unsuccessful, Shirvell said in a written statement.

The law bans abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest, though exceptions are made for severe fetal abnormalities. DeSantis emphasized that this law represents significant protections for life, and the event was marked by speeches, prayers, and testimony from women who shared personal stories about abortion.

The law’s passage comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on a similar 15-week abortion law from Mississippi, which may lead to the reversal of long-standing precedents like Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Florida’s 15-week ban is set to take effect on July 1, 2022. The Florida Supreme Court, with a conservative majority appointed by DeSantis, may also play a role in the law’s future.

The law has sparked strong reactions. Abortion rights advocates, including the ACLU and Democratic politicians, criticized it as unconstitutional and harmful to women’s rights. They highlighted the lack of exemptions for rape and incest, calling it an attack on bodily autonomy. In contrast, pro-life advocates celebrated the bill, praising it as a historic move that would save thousands of unborn children.

The bill signing also featured remarks from key Republican figures, including Rep. Erin Grall and Sen. Kelli Stargel, who expressed their opposition to Roe v. Wade and endorsed the goal of eliminating abortion entirely. The law’s passage has intensified the political debate in Florida, with figures like Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist condemning it, while DeSantis supporters tout it as a victory for pro-life values.","['DeSanti', 'Florida Phoenix', 'Environment Culture Society', 'The', '##IB', 'Society', 'Legislature', 'DeSantis', 'Michael Moline', 'Republican', 'Erin Grall', 'House', 'HB 5', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Credit DeSanti', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Nacion de Fe', 'Kissimmee', 'American Civil Liberties Union', 'Kara Gross', 'Floridian', 'HB 5', 'U', 'S', 'Court', 'Roe', 'Wade', 'Casey', 'Florida', 'Mississippi', 'Republican', 'Mississippi', 'Florida', 'Constitution', 'Florida', 'Court']","On April 14, 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a controversial 15-week abortion ban (HB 5) into law during a church ceremony that had many elements of a religious service. The event took place at Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee, where DeSantis, flanked by Republican legislators and pro-life advocates, emphasized the importance of defending “those who can’t defend themselves.” He hailed the law as a major step in protecting life. The law bans most abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions only for severe fetal abnormalities, but not for cases of rape or incest.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) swiftly condemned the law, pledging to challenge it in court, citing its violation of constitutional rights under precedents like Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. Advocates for abortion rights warned that the law would have severe consequences for pregnant people, particularly those unable to travel for an abortion. The law is set to take effect on July 1, 2022, with hopes that the U.S. Supreme Court, under its new Republican supermajority, will uphold a similar law from Mississippi, possibly overturning Roe.

The bill-signing ceremony featured testimonies from women who had undergone abortions and women who chose to carry their pregnancies to term, reinforcing the law’s support from the pro-life movement. Lawmakers like State Rep. Erin Grall and State Sen. Kelli Stargel framed the bill as part of a broader conservative movement to reverse Roe v. Wade.

The signing event contrasted with a more subdued 2020 bill-signing for parental consent in abortion cases. DeSantis’ actions were celebrated by pro-life supporters, including Florida Voice for the Unborn, which praised the law as a historic step in saving unborn children.

However, the law drew sharp opposition from Democrats. Agricultural Commissioner Nikki Fried, running for governor, called the law an assault on women, while Rep. Charlie Crist, another Democratic gubernatorial candidate, denounced it as an unconstitutional attack on women’s reproductive rights. State Sen. Lauren Book criticized the law as an authoritarian move, arguing it regressed women’s freedoms by forcing them to carry pregnancies against their will.

Overall, the law represents a significant shift in Florida’s abortion policies, one that will likely lead to intense legal battles and further polarization of abortion rights debates in the U.S.",R,

So for years, Cheryl Bachelder kept quiet. She stood out professionally as the rare female CEO of a major corporation, overseeing Popeyes while chasing after three daughters and, eventually, four grandsons. As a Christian, she watched with distaste as her fellow business leaders indulged the decadence and money-fueled antics of the 1980s and 90s, posing on magazine covers with jets and girls. She and her husband donated to candidates for political office whom they knew and personally trusted. But because she oversaw a large, publicly traded company, Bachelder mostly kept her views on one particularly controversial issue secret. If I go to lunch with a good friend, and they find out Im pro-life, I can tell you the look on their face, she told me. Youre kidding me. You are an educated, CEO woman and youre pro-life. Whats wrong with you?Recently, Bachelder has become captivated by what will happen if the anti-abortion-rights movement succeeds in its goal to make abortion illegal in the United States. What if there were a lot more God-given babies, and we were, as a community, completely unprepared to help their mothers? she said. Now that shes retired, Bachelder is willing to speak publicly about her views on abortionour conversation was the first time she had spoken with a journalist for a national news outlet about her involvement in the anti-abortion-rights movement.Activists in that movement are working towards a grand, and perhaps fantastical, vision a world where abortion is not just illegal, but unthinkable, and where babies are much more common as a result. This future has felt more tangible since the election of Donald Trump, who appointed two justices to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who are skeptical of the constitutional right to abortion laid out in Roe v. Wade. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the staunchest defenders of abortion on the Court, recently hospitalized and going through a new round of chemotherapy, its possible that abortion rights will face an existential challenge within the next few years. Anti-abortion-rights activists realize that this moment of triumph will require planningand infrastructure. The magnitude of that question is huge, Bachelder said. I think its fair to say every community is unprepared to answer that question todayprobably hasnt even thought about it.She has long believed that life begins at conception and that death is God-ordained and should not be invited early with assisted suicide or other kinds of interventions. She and her husband have donated to faith-based organizations that provide pregnancy support and attempt to direct people away from abortion. But she nevertheless worries about getting into the mud-throwing conversations of politics, she said. We actually work on solving things, in the business world. We dont have any time to yell and scream and throw things. She longs, in other words, for association with an anti-abortion-rights movement that is apolitical, even though abortion is one of the most politically charged topics of our time.Read The progressive roots of the pro-life movementLate last year, Bachelder attended a fundraiser hosted by the Susan B. Anthony List, or SBA List, the anti-abortion-rights organization that has arguably had the most influence over Trumps judicial appointments and voter outreach on this issue, at a home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a tony city north of Atlanta. She and a group of friends, mostly other business leaders, were there to brainstorm all the community support systems that would need to be stronger in a world where abortion is illegal mental-health services, addiction-recovery programs, affordable child care. Many of their proposed solutions didnt touch the messy business of politics. One woman even suggested that they consider taking pregnant women into their homes. Wow, Bachelder said to herself, I havent thought about that. Along with other members of this group, Bachelder agreed to financially back an SBA List test program in Georgia called PLANthe Pregnancy and Life Assistance Networkthat would compile and publicize resources already available to women dealing with unplanned pregnancies, modeled after a version of the program in Northern Virginia. In theory, its an ambitious effort to find common ground between hard-core anti-abortion-rights activists and people who want to help pregnant women but may not be convinced that abortion should be completely banned.Marjorie Dannenfelser, the head of the SBA List, brought White House-branded Twizzlers and a commemorative plate along to the gatheringspoils of her success in Washington. We believe we are coming much closer to a different kind of world, where Roe v. Wade is either unrecognizable because its been chipped away or its overturned and laws start to flourish in states that reflect the will of the people who live there, she told me. Over the past year, the SBA Lists research organization, the Charlotte Lozier Institute, has undertaken a massive effort to look at the state resources available to pregnant women and children, including housing, medical centers, income limits for Medicaid, and more. This served as a foundation for PLAN, which is still in its early stages. The projectimagining the beatific vision of a post-Roe world, as Dannenfelser put itis partly pitched at people like Bachelder who oppose abortion but shy away from partisan battles. A lot of donors, a lot of people in the evangelical community, a lot of breathing human beings just hate politics right now, Dannenfelser said. She spends her days in the roughest area of politics, she added, fighting over a controversial issue in tightly contested elections. My dream, and my belief, is that at the heart of the pro-life movement, there is not that dissonance of political opposition.There is an inherent tension in an anti-abortion-rights project designed to rally social services for women, no matter how ostensibly apolitical it may be. Over the past two decades, the anti-abortion-rights movement has aligned itself almost exclusively with the GOP, which generally favors cutting government funding for housing, food stamps, and other programs that support poor women and children. No group has solidified this partisan alignment more than the SBA List, which pours money and manpower into supporting Republicans in competitive races. As Democrats more aggressively pursue the expansion of abortion rights, the SBA List sees the Republican Party as its only viable ally, at least at the national level.Bachelder envisions a future stage of the PLAN project in which policy makers would do a version of the gap-planning analysis that businesses use to anticipate what customersin this case, pregnant womenmight need. But getting there, to a place where most anti-abortion-rights legislators would also champion the expansion of social services, would require a massive political realignment. Although a post-Roe world has seemed more possible than ever lately, its also a ways off.Read When conservative justices revoltThis summer, the anti-abortion-rights movement suffered a major defeat at the Supreme Court, when Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal wing in June Medical Services v. Russo to strike down a Louisiana law that would have restricted abortion access. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence lashed out at Roberts in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, calling him a disappointment to conservatives.Some anti-abortion-rights activists may dream of building a postabortion future. But for the present, the political fight is all-consuming. One thing is clear, Pence tweeted in June We need more Conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. FourMoreYears.Emma Green is a staff writer at The New Yorker. Previously, she was a staff writer at The Atlantic, covering politics, policy, and religion.","The article from The Atlantic discusses how the anti-abortion-rights movement in the U.S. is preparing for a potential post-Roe v. Wade scenario, focusing on strategies to support pregnant women and children in a society where abortion is illegal. The movement, which envisions a world where abortion is not only illegal but “unthinkable,” has gained momentum with recent conservative appointments to the Supreme Court, creating the potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned or diminished.

One central figure is Cheryl Bachelder, former CEO of Popeyes and a pro-life advocate, who represents a segment of anti-abortion supporters interested in building supportive infrastructure rather than engaging in political battles. Along with other business leaders, Bachelder supports initiatives like the Pregnancy and Life Assistance Network (PLAN), a program piloted by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) to provide resources to women facing unplanned pregnancies. This program seeks to compile and make accessible services such as mental health care, addiction recovery, and affordable childcare. The SBA List, led by Marjorie Dannenfelser, has been influential in promoting anti-abortion judges and in mobilizing support within the GOP. While Dannenfelser envisions a future where anti-abortion advocacy is less partisan, the movement’s close alliance with the Republican Party remains strong, primarily due to the party’s stance on limiting abortion access.

However, the movement faces challenges in aligning its goals with social services traditionally supported by Democrats, as many anti-abortion-rights legislators oppose government spending on welfare programs that would assist low-income mothers and children. This tension complicates the plan for a post-Roe world, as the desired increase in social support for mothers may require shifts in political priorities.

Despite recent setbacks, such as the Supreme Court’s decision in June Medical Services v. Russo, which struck down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, the movement remains steadfast. Figures like Vice President Mike Pence have continued to advocate for conservative justices to further their cause. The article suggests that while some activists focus on creating a supportive, apolitical future, the movement’s current reality is deeply enmeshed in political strife and the pursuit of legal victories.","['Anti - Abortion - Rights Movement', 'America', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'The Atlantic', 'Atlantic', 'Atlantic', 'Atlantic', 'Anti - Abortion - Rights Movement', 'Post', 'Roe World', 'Emma Green', 'Atlantic', 'Cheryl Bachelder', 'Pope', '##yes', 'Christian', 'Bachelder', 'Bach', 'United', 'States', 'God', 'Bach']","On April 14, 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban (HB 5) into law at a church ceremony, marking a significant shift in the state’s abortion policies.

Home Health topics Our work News Emergencies About us Detail 7 December 2020 Feature story Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh Many adolescents make the transition to adulthood in good health, yet others might face injuries resulting from an accident or violence experience mental health or substance abuse conditions go through early childbearing which includes increased risks for newborns and young mothers or fall ill with endemic diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria.Addressing adolescents health needs, particularly among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, is key to promoting a healthy development among adolescents and youths. In recent years, the World Health Organization WHO has strived to expand options for young people whilst prioritizing adolescent rights in health emergencies.In Coxs Bazar, home to nearly 325 000 Rohingya adolescents, a range of individuals and institutions play an important role in promoting adolescents health and well-being. WHO is coordinating with the Government of Bangladesh GoB, a Sexual Reproductive Health working group and an Adolescent Task Force to support partners providing adolescent-friendly services in their health facilties. The impact goes far beyond sexual and reproductive health and rights outcomes. WHO is striving to expand health options for the nearly 325 000 Rohingya adolescents in Coxs Bazar by offering capacity building to partners providing adolescent-friendly services. WHO BangladeshTatiana Almeida A few days ago a 17-year-old Rohingya girl came to see me. She sounded very determined in learning about contraception options and I gave her all the information pointing out that it was her body and as such her choice whether to use contraceptives which will help prevent sexually transmitted diseases and delay pregnancy, says Umme Hani, a Midwife working at Partners in Health and Development PHD primary health center at Camp 10, in Ukhiya.I could see, however, that she wasnt doing well and started making friendly questions just as I learned at the WHO training. When she finally opened up, she told me in tears that her family had arranged her marriage. As a smart young woman, she had decided to delay pregnancy until she was sure that her husband would be a good father. I ensured her that she could visit me anytime she needed a friend, concludes Umme Hani.At the heart of any health care system, health care workers such as Midwife Umme Hani are pivotal to address the specific needs of adolescents throught equitable, appropriate, effective and accessible health care services. In the Rohingya Refugee camps in Coxs Bazar, when adolescents from Camp 10 have health-related concerns they can talk to Umme Hani, a Midwife trained by WHO to provide adolescent-friendly services. WHO BangladeshTatiana Almeida The Partners in Health and Development PHD primary health center facility at Camp 10, in Ukhiya, reaches a population of over 16 000 Rohingya refugees seeing between 100 to 250 patients a day. Among these, 15 to 20 are adolescents. WHO BangladeshTatiana Almeida To date, the Training on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights ASRHR has reached 50 health care workers to strenghthen adolescent-friendly services at 50 health care facilities in Coxs Bazar. More batches are planned to reach a total of 120 health care professionals from different partner organizations. WHO National Consultant on Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, Adolescent Health, Dr Tasnova Sadneen, is facilitating the training together with ASRHR Master Trainers from UNFPA, IOM, IRC, SCI and PHD.Frontline health care workers with adequate training and knowledge can play an important role in promoting the health and health seeking behaviours among adolescents. We cant deny that Rohingya adolescents and youths - a significant portion of the refugee population in Coxs Bazar - need skilled health workforce to respond to their health needs. One of the components of this training is to guide health care workers on how to build a relationship of trust, understanding and compassion with adolescent patients, explains Dr Tasnova Sadneen.Coxs Bazar Civil Surgeon, Dr Mahbubur Rahman, WHO Head of Sub-Office, Dr Kai von Harbou, and Dr Tasnova Sadneen at the Training on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights ASRHR held in Coxs Bazar in November 2020. ISCGSyed TafhimEffective interventions for improving adolescent health and development are vital in Coxs Bazar and I am very happy to see many health care workers here today willing to learn more about adolescent-friendly health approaches. I believe that after your participation in the ASRH training you will feel more confident in providing health care services to adolescents and I wish you much success while doing so, says Coxs Bazar Civil Surgeon, Dr Mahbubur Rahman, at the opening ceremony.Services geared for adolescents go far beyond sexual and reproductive health as they address the full range of adolescents health and development needs. With that in mind, and with the guidance of the Civil Surgeon, we are creating training opportunities to expand the knowledge on adolescent health and development and their implications in clinical practice. I believe this is going to advance and strenghten universal health coverage for both Rohingya refugees and host communities in Coxs Bazar, explains WHO Head of Sub-Office, Dr Kai von Harbou. Making health services adolescent friendly sets out the public health rationale for making it easier for adolescents to obtain the health services that they need to protect and improve their health and wellbeing, including sexual and reproductive health services.WHO and partners are ensuring the continued prioritization of sexual and reproductive health and rights throughout COVID-19 response in humanitarian settings, and to bring a gender lens to the response.

This initiative involves training local health workers to better serve adolescents, particularly those at risk of early marriage, mental health issues, substance abuse, and endemic diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.

In collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh and various partners, WHO’s approach prioritizes equitable, effective, and accessible healthcare for Rohingya youths. By training healthcare providers, such as midwives and clinic staff, WHO is strengthening their ability to engage adolescents with trust, empathy, and culturally sensitive care. This training includes guidance on SRH, equipping healthcare workers to discuss contraception, family planning, and personal autonomy with young patients—critical for adolescents navigating family pressures or arranged marriages.

One example is Umme Hani, a midwife trained by WHO, who offers compassionate counseling at a camp health facility, serving as a trusted resource for young people facing complex personal and health challenges. WHO’s training sessions have thus far reached 50 healthcare professionals across 50 facilities in Cox’s Bazar, with plans to expand to 120 providers. These trained professionals are instrumental in fostering health-seeking behaviors among adolescents and are expected to contribute to universal health coverage for both refugee and host communities.

Dr. Tasnova Sadneen and Dr. Kai von Harbou emphasize that the initiative’s goal is to ensure the holistic health and development of adolescents while maintaining a strong focus on SRH and gender-sensitive approaches, particularly vital amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This strategic commitment is intended to improve the overall well-being of Rohingya adolescents, providing a foundation for healthier adulthood and advancing public health objectives in this vulnerable population.","['Rohingya', 'Region', 'WHO', 'Africa Americas South', 'East Asia Europe Eastern Mediterranean Western Pacific', 'WHO', 'South', 'East Asia', 'Region', 'Bangladesh Bhutan Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea India Indonesia Maldives Myanmar Nepal Sri Lanka Thailand Timor - Leste', 'Coxs Bazar', 'Bangladesh', 'World Health Organization WHO', 'Coxs Bazar', 'R', '##oh', '##ingya', 'WHO', 'Government of Bangladesh GoB', 'Sexual Rep', '##uctive Health', 'Ad', 'Task Force', 'WHO', 'Rohingya', 'Coxs Bazar', 'WHO', 'Bangladesh', '##ana Almei', '##da', 'Um', 'Han', 'WHO']","The World Health Organization (WHO) has been focusing on addressing the health needs of Rohingya adolescents in Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh, where nearly 325,000 Rohingya adolescents live.

A pivotal aspect of the effort involves training health workers to provide adolescent-friendly services. In Coxs Bazar, health workers like midwife Umme Hani, who received training from WHO, play an essential role in offering healthcare and guidance. For example, Umme Hani provided sexual health advice to a 17-year-old Rohingya girl, supporting her decision to delay pregnancy and offering emotional support when the girl revealed her arranged marriage.

To strengthen the adolescent healthcare workforce, WHO’s training on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (ASRHR) has already reached 50 healthcare workers in Coxs Bazar. More training sessions are planned, aiming to educate 120 professionals. The training emphasizes building trust with adolescent patients and offering comprehensive health services, beyond just sexual and reproductive health.

In addition to addressing sexual health, the WHO’s approach includes ensuring healthcare workers are equipped to meet the broader health needs of adolescents. These efforts support both Rohingya refugees and local communities, contributing to the goal of universal health coverage in the region.

Key figures involved in the training and efforts include Dr. Mahbubur Rahman (Coxs Bazar Civil Surgeon), Dr. Kai von Harbou (WHO Head of Sub-Office), and Dr. Tasnova Sadneen (WHO National Consultant on Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, and Adolescent Health). The initiative aligns with WHO’s broader commitment to improving adolescent health in humanitarian settings and continues to prioritize sexual and reproductive health amidst challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.",C,
"Legislature: Senate Committee Advances Bill To Repeal Abortion Law, Republican Senators Respond ‚Äì Los Alamos Reporter","Legislature Senate Committee Advances Bill To Repeal Abortion Law, Republican Senators Respond Los Alamos Reporter Los Alamos Reporter The News from Los Alamos Beyond Menu Skip to content Home About Contact January 26, 2021 Los Alamos Reporter Legislature Senate Committee Advances Bill To Repeal Abortion Law, Republican Senators Respond SENATE REPUBLICANS NEWS After a two-hour long delay and a hearing marred by technical difficulties and limited public participation, the virtual Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee voted Monday along party lines to repeal New Mexicos abortion law. Senate Bill 10, sponsored by Democratic Senator Linda Lopez District 11-Bernalillo and others, would strike an entire section of law that among other things protects medical professionals from being forced to participate in abortions and requires that abortions be performed by licensed physicians. Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals, said Senator Gregg Schmedes District 19-Bernalillo, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Torrance. As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans. The current law includes protections from recriminatory action when a hospital or their staff decline to perform abortions based on moral or religious grounds. In 1973, the New Mexico Court of Appeals declared this section of the law to be constitutional and a 1990 New Mexico Attorney General Opinion further reiterated its constitutionality. A total repeal of New Mexicos abortion law is not the solution, added Senator Crystal Diamond District 35-Dona Ana, Hidalgo, Luna, and Sierra. In addition to keeping the conscience clause intact, we should be working to strengthen, not weaken standards of care for women. The thought that a non-physician would be allowed to perform a dangerous, late-term abortion on a minor child without any parental knowledge is unconscionable. That is the type of scenario we are exposing women to if this bill passes. Senate Bill 10 advanced from the Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on a 5-3 vote with all three Republican Senators, Gregg Schmedes, David Gallegos, and Stuart Ingle, voting in opposition. The bill will now be referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee where it could be heard as early as next week. Share thisTweetEmailPrintLike thisLike Loading.

Email Required Name Required Website d","The New Mexico Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee recently advanced Senate Bill 10, which proposes to repeal the state’s existing abortion law. Sponsored by Democratic Senator Linda Lopez, the bill aims to remove protections that currently exempt medical professionals from being compelled to perform abortions based on moral or religious grounds and mandates that only licensed physicians perform these procedures. The current law, which was deemed constitutional by both the New Mexico Court of Appeals in 1973 and a 1990 Attorney General opinion, also protects hospitals and staff from punitive action if they refuse to participate in abortion services due to conscientious objections.

Republican senators voiced strong opposition to the bill. Senator Gregg Schmedes, a medical doctor, warned that the loss of these protections might prompt some healthcare professionals to leave the state, potentially limiting healthcare access in New Mexico. Senator Crystal Diamond expressed concerns about safety and standards of care, arguing that the bill could lead to situations where non-physicians are allowed to perform high-risk abortions, including on minors without parental knowledge.

The committee’s vote fell along party lines, with a 5-3 split in favor of advancing the bill, supported by Democrats and opposed by Republicans. The bill is set to proceed to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further consideration.","['Senate Committee', 'Abortion Law', 'Republican', 'Los Alamos Reporter Los Alamos', 'Los Alamos', 'Los Alamos Reporter Legislature Senate Committee', 'Abortion Law', 'Republican', '##BLIC', 'Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee', 'New Mexico', 'Senate', 'Bill 10', 'Democratic', 'Linda Lopez', 'Bernalillo', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Gregg Schmede', 'Bernalillo', 'Sandoval', 'Santa Fe', 'Torrance', 'New Mexican', 'New Mexico Court of Appeals', 'New Mexico', 'New Mexico', 'Crystal Diamond', 'Dona Ana', 'Hidalgo', 'Luna', 'Sierra', 'Senate', 'Senate', 'Affairs Committee', 'Republican', 'Gregg', 'David', 'Stuart', 'Senate Judiciary Committee']","On January 26, 2021, the New Mexico Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee voted to advance Senate Bill 10, a proposal to repeal the state’s abortion law.

Republican Senators, including Gregg Schmedes (District 19, covering Bernalillo, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Torrance), opposed the bill. Schmedes, a medical doctor, emphasized that repealing the law could result in healthcare professionals leaving New Mexico due to a loss of conscience protections, which could harm access to healthcare. Other Republican legislators, such as Senator Crystal Diamond (District 35, covering Dona Ana, Hidalgo, Luna, and Sierra), argued that the bill would weaken standards of care for women, particularly in cases of late-term abortion performed by non-physicians.

The bill passed the committee on a 5-3 vote, with all three Republican Senators voting against it. It will now proceed to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further review. The debate centers on balancing access to abortion with protections for medical professionals and standards of care.",R,

Tweet Share Comment Popular in Even the Supreme Courts Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To So Trumps Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh? John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges Once again, womens reproductive freedom is more concerned with doctors than women. Following the briefing and oral arguments in June Medical, the Louisiana case that calls into question the continued force of Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Whole Womans Health, its now quite clear that the primary questions opponents of reproductive freedom are asking have nothing to do with maternal autonomy or decision-making, and everything to do with abortion providers and whether they are bad people and unfit doctors. Louisianas transparently unconstitutional lawthe same law that was struck down from Texas in 2016 at the high courtmandates that abortion providers must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they practice. The briefs supporting the law openly advance arguments that recklessly pit women against their own abortion providers. After years of merely implying that such providers are cash-starved grifters who prey on foolish women in rat-infested death labs, the critique now forms part of the spine of the states case, the Department of Justices defense, and Samuel Alitos line of questioning at arguments. Given that in 1973, Roe v. Wade famously located the right to abortion in the bilateral relationship between women and their physicians Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained in her Supreme Court confirmation hearing that the Roe decision is a highly medically oriented decision because it features, along with the woman, the right of the doctor to exercise his profession, the attempt to fracture that relationship is hardly a surprise. Justice Harry Blackmun, who authored the 72 majority opinion, mentioned the word physician 48 times and woman only 44 times in the decision. Since Roe, then, it has been at least tacitly understood that the interests of pregnant women and their physicians were aligned in reproductive freedom cases. That is the reason abortion providers and clinics were granted decadeslong standing to bring legal challenges on behalf of their patients, who would by necessity be too poor, too distracted, or too pregnant to file suit in what would likely be grueling yearslong litigation. After all, it is difficult, if you are seeking to terminate a pregnancy, to remain pregnant for the three years it takes a case to wend its way through the legal system. But in his dissent in Whole Womans Health, Justice Clarence Thomas proposed a radical new notion Clinics and abortion doctors should be denied standing to sue on behalf of the pregnant women they treat because these doctors were fundamentally horriblecorrupt and exploitative and seeking only to profit off the trusting women they purported to serve. As such, they have a vested interest in fighting sensible regulations that protect women, and their interests are inherently at odds with those of their patients. Now, four years later, as the state of Louisiana brings the same basic complaint that Whole Womans Health resolved, the state is taking its cue from Thomas. In its brief in June Medical, Louisiana put it this way Abortion providers and their patients have an obvious conflict in the inevitable tradeoff between cost and safety. Women have an interest in ensuring their own health and safety when they choose to obtain an abortion. But plaintiffs interest is to reduce compliance costs and government oversight while providing as many abortions as possible. And Justice Samuel Alito put it this way at Wednesdays oral argument, questioning the lawyer representing the clinics Would you agree with the general proposition that a party should not be able to sue ostensibly to protect the right of other people, if there is a real conflict of interest between the party who is suing and those whose rights the party claims to be attempting to defend? When the lawyer replied that there was no such conflict, he said he found that answer amazing. Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, the Trump administrations attorney, further insisted that the interests of abortion physicians and patients are not necessarily aligned. One is the interest of for-profit providers and not being regulated in particular ways. The other is the interest of women in their own health and safety. It sounds like a claim about female autonomy, but in fact its a claim rooted in doubts about female autonomy. To buy into this reasoning is to further take for granted that abortion providers are different from plastic surgeons, dental surgeons, and every other health care provider in ways that require extra regulation, even when those regulations are medically unnecessary, geographically irrational, and potentially catastrophically dangerous to women. Further, as was the case in Roe v. Wade, the pregnant woman has become, again, at most the best supporting actress in a medical drama between mostly male legislators, mostly male jurists, and their mostly male ideas about physicians and suggestible women. We may have thought wed come a long way from Blackmuns physician-centered analysis in Roe, to the at least nominally woman-centered language of Casey and the emphatically woman-centered rhetoric of Whole Womans Health, but it seems we have merely arrived back at the same place we started A fight about whether abortion doctors do or do not have their patients best interests at heart. It is fitting that in a week in which women have become invisible in so many other contexts in the public sphere, theyve also been all but erased, once again, from their own reproductive rights. There has always been a paradox that lies in centering abortion rights in the providerone that we tend to elide in modern debates about doctrine. At one point, in the early abortion battles, doctors and pregnant women really were at odds In her essential new book, Policing the Womb, professor Michele Goodwin of the University of California, Irvine, recounts the early history of American gynecology, including Marion Sims, the grandfather of gynecology who conducted his experiments on the female slaves he rented. Early gynecology organized itself around white male doctors who demonized and displaced female midwives. As Goodwin notes, the legal history of abortion and its regulation root in the quagmire created out of the racialization and sex-exclusivity of reproductive medicine in the United States. That these were the men to whom Blackmun, who had served as counsel for the Mayo Clinic, was so deferential in Roe went unnoticed at the time by most court watchers, although the young litigator, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, even then regretted that the case was always framed from the physicians standpoint, and not the womans. The physicians who seek admitting privileges in the Louisiana lawsuit are a far cry from the turf-grabbing doctors of the early gynecology profession, and even from the avuncular physicians of Blackmuns 1970s Roe opinion. These providers, often imperiling their own lives and the lives of their families, are so phenomenally proficient that they have a hospitalization rate that stands, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted in Whole Womans Health, at less than one-quarter of 1 percent in the first trimester, and less than one-half of 1 percent in the second trimester. This very proficiency is part of the reason they cannot obtain admitting privileges and the record shows that they did in fact try and were refused. Hospitals dont want to give such privileges to physicians who almost never need admit a patient. As Breyer noted in Whole Womans Health, doctors at the El Paso clinic in Texas performed 17,000 procedures in the preceding 10 years and not one had to be transferred to a hospital. That made admitting privileges impossible to obtain. There is no medical need for extra credentialing, and requiring the privileges serves only to cast abortion providers as dubious stewards of their patients health. At this moment when government is working double time to cast physicians and science as less than reliable, that is a particularly nasty smear. The irony, then, is that despite the wobbly doctor-based reasoning of Roe, the physicians in contemporary cases are so profoundly aligned with the interests of their patients that they take on landmark lawsuits, subject themselves to years of depositions and expense, in order to serve patients who desperately need them to protect their interests in court. They are not the all-knowing wise decision-makers of Roe, nor are they the chop-shop villians Alito imagines. They arenow more than everequal partners in a reproductive rights ground war from which women as actual combatants with agency and moral sophistication are being systematically erased. Focusing on false, unfounded stereotypes about wicked abortion providers in June Medical is especially problematic given that its clear that those who seek to shutter clinics in this fashion are also oddly willing to jail women who seek abortions in Ohio and Georgia. Texas held hearings last year about imposing capital punishment for women who terminate their pregnancies. So, which is it? Are women culpable moral agents who should be punished for their choices, or are they the unwitting dupes of unscrupulous abortion doctors? And how is it possible that in Texas and Louisiana, it now appears that they can somehow be both? Are women evil or just stupid when they seek to end a pregnancy? Is her doctor a partner or a grifter? Or have we finally reached the stage in the law of reproductive justice at which we will accept that a woman is so perfectly invisible that whether she makes her own choices or her doctor makes them for her doesnt even matter anymore?

In the Louisiana case June Medical Services v. Russo, the focus is on challenging the qualifications and trustworthiness of abortion providers, positioning them as adversaries to women’s health. Louisiana’s law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges was previously deemed unconstitutional but is now being revisited, with opponents framing abortion providers as profit-driven and potentially unsafe.

Lithwick highlights that the tactic of questioning doctors’ motives mirrors aspects of the Roe v. Wade decision, which placed significant emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship, often prioritizing the role of physicians in reproductive decisions over the autonomy of women. The Louisiana law supporters argue that there is an inherent conflict of interest between abortion providers, who seek to reduce regulation, and patients, who need protection. Justices such as Samuel Alito and figures from the Trump administration echoed this view, suggesting abortion doctors might not act in their patients’ best interests.

Lithwick also delves into historical tensions in reproductive healthcare, where male-dominated gynecology once marginalized midwives and restricted women’s roles in reproductive decisions. She argues that framing abortion debates around the ethics and qualifications of doctors ignores the agency and autonomy of women. Furthermore, the regulations imposed on providers, though medically unnecessary, serve to portray them as disreputable, a narrative reinforced by conservative justices and advocates. These stereotypes support broader efforts to criminalize abortion, evidenced by recent proposals in states like Ohio, Georgia, and Texas that even consider punishing women directly for seeking abortions.

Lithwick concludes by critiquing the ongoing erasure of women from the center of reproductive rights discussions. She questions whether the law will continue to disregard women’s autonomy, reducing them to passive figures in a battle that frames them as either “misled” or “culpable.” Ultimately, the article argues that the anti-abortion strategy is a troubling reversal, focusing on discrediting providers as a means of limiting access, while sidelining women’s rights altogether.","['Slate Shop', 'Slate', 'Slate', 'Insta', '##gram Slate', 'Twitter Slate', 'Facebook Slate', 'Rights', 'A', '##tion', 'Dahlia Lithwick', 'Slate', 'Leif Skoog', '##forsCorbis', 'Getty Images', 'Saul Lo', '##P', 'Getty Images', 'Supreme Courts', '5th Circuit', 'Stormy Daniels', 'Trump', 'John Roberts', 'June', 'Medical', 'Louisiana', 'Planned Parenthood', 'Casey', 'Whole Womans Health', 'Texas', 'Department', 'Justice', 'Samuel', 'Ali', 'Roe', 'Ruth']","In her article “The Rights New Strategy to Fight Abortion Takes Aim at Doctors,” Dahlia Lithwick examines the evolving legal and rhetorical attack on abortion rights, specifically focusing on how opponents of reproductive freedom are increasingly targeting abortion providers rather than directly challenging women’s autonomy. The article explores the implications of a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges, a law that was previously struck down in Texas.

Lithwick highlights that the primary legal arguments now focus on whether abortion providers are “bad” or “unfit” doctors, rather than considering the rights of women. This strategy stems from a broader skepticism toward abortion providers, a narrative that Justice Clarence Thomas advanced in his dissent in Whole Woman’s Health, suggesting that doctors should not have standing to defend the rights of women because they are seen as profit-driven and inherently in conflict with their patients’ interests.

In the ongoing June Medical case, Louisiana’s defense of the law echoes this sentiment, arguing that abortion providers and women have conflicting interests, with the state framing providers as prioritizing financial gain over patient safety. Justice Samuel Alito also questioned whether abortion doctors could truly represent their patients in court, further reinforcing this notion. Lithwick critiques this view, asserting that it undermines the doctor-patient relationship that has been central to reproductive rights since Roe v. Wade.

The article also touches on the historical context of gynecology and abortion law, referencing the early dominance of white male physicians and the displacement of female midwives. Lithwick argues that while Roe initially centered on the physician’s role, today’s abortion providers are highly competent and dedicated professionals whose interests align with those of their patients. She warns that efforts to discredit these providers not only jeopardize women’s health but also erode their autonomy by reducing them to mere passive recipients of care, rather than active decision-makers.

Lithwick concludes by underscoring the absurdity of the current legal arguments, questioning whether women are seen as responsible agents or vulnerable victims manipulated by exploitative doctors. Ultimately, the article highlights how the law’s growing focus on abortion providers, rather than women’s rights, erases women’s agency in the fight for reproductive freedom.",L,
"Over 80% of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll | Notes From Poland","Over 80 of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll Notes From Poland News Insights Po polsku Topics Politics Society Culture Business History Education Energy Climate Law Media Podcasts Notes from Poland Podcast The VoiCEE podcast About us Our story Editorial team Advisory Board Notes from Poland Foundation Contact Newsletters Notes from Poland Newsletter Central and Eastern Europe Newsletter Select Page Over 80 of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll Feb 18, 2021 Society Among women in Poland aged 18 to 40, only 2 say they support the recent near-total ban on abortion, while 7 want a complete ban, according to a new poll. By contrast, the largest proportion 44 want abortion to be available on demand. Meanwhile, after much pressure to take a stance on this issue, Polands main opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform PO, has today issued a new position on abortion. It favours not just returning to the previous status quo, but liberalising access to terminations. From a Polityka survey of Polish women of reproductive age. 44 think abortion should be permitted on demand up to 12th week.38 support the status quo prior to the ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal.2 agree with the ruling.7 think abortion should be banned outright. pic.twitter.comq9yyrjg06G Ben Stanley BDStanley February 17, 2021 In the new Kantar poll for Polityka the first to look specifically at the women most directly affected by the abortion law a plurality of 44 expressed the view that abortion should be available on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy. A further 38 said that they support the status quo prior to the recent change, when pregnancies could be terminated in three cases if they threatened the mothers life or health, if they resulted from rape or incest, or if the foetus suffered from severe defects. Only 2 said that they support the current situation, introduced by a Constitutional Tribunal ruling that banned the last of those three options which made up almost all legal terminations in Poland. A further 7 want a complete ban on abortion and 9 did not express a position. While 90 of respondents said that women carrying foetuses with fatal defects should be allowed an abortion, 67 agreed that the procedure should also be allowed if the foetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome as it was before the recent ruling. Over a quarter 27 said it should not be permitted for cases of Down syndrome. Majority of Poles support abortion protests and popularity of ruling party has dropped, polls show Polling has consistently shown that, among the Polish population as a whole, a large majority oppose the anti-abortion ruling and support the mass protests that have emerged in opposition to it. However, most favour a return to the previous status quo rather than a liberalisation of access to abortion. The new Kantar poll of women finds that the youngest respondents aged 18 to 24 were the most strongly in favour liberalisation, with 57 supporting abortion on demand and 29 favouring a return to the previous status quo. Likewise, 60 women in urban areas want abortion to be available on demand while 35 support a return to the status quo. In more rural areas, which are generally more conservative, the figures are 37 and 39 respectively. Participants in the abortion protests have been disproportionately urban and young. A recent study by CBOS a state-linked research agency found that young Poles are now more likely to hold left-wing views than centrist or right-wing ones for the first time in Polands post-communist history. Left-wing views highest ever recorded among young Poles, above right-wing and centrist for first time Meanwhile, in the new Kantar poll, only 7 of the women surveyed said they believed that the Constitutional Tribunals ruling was a decision it made independently. Exactly a quarter said it was due to pressure from the Catholic church, while 29 saw it as a result of an internal power struggle in the ruling camp. Almost half 45 said that the abortion issue would influence their decisions in future elections. Notably, among young women who identified themselves as supporters of the national-conservative Law and Justice PiS party, almost half support either a return to the previous status quo 27 or abortion on demand 20. PiS has supported the tightening of the abortion law. Its leader, Jarosaw Kaczyski, said that his party will strive to ensure that even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is condemned to death, is severely deformed, will end in birth, so that the child can be christened, buried, given a name. Abortion protests aim to destroy Poland and end the history of the Polish nation, says Kaczyski Among young women who support the centrist Civic Coalition which is led by PO, Kantar found that almost two thirds 64 favour abortion being available on demand. PO, which encompasses both socially liberal and more conservative wings, has been under pressure to take a clearer stance on abortion since the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was issued last October. The party had previously been in favour of the pre-ruling status quo. However, its leader, Borys Budka, recently said there can now be no return to that so-called compromise. POs deputy leader, Rafa Trzaskowski, likewise said that the pseudo-compromise has been buried by PiS. At a press conference today, the party set out its new position. We want the three conditions for abortion that were in force under the previous law to continue to apply, but we will also give the possibility of terminating pregnancy up to the 12th week in exceptional circumstances, said Magorzata Kidawa-Boska, who has been leading POs committee working on a new position. Kobiety musz mie prawo do podejmowania osobistej decyzji dotyczcej macierzystwa w zgodzie z wasnym sumieniem. Musz mie zapewnion kompleksow opiek. Przedstawilimy dzi Pakiet Praw Kobiet, bo chcemy, by kobiety byy bezpieczne i miay zagwarantowane prawo wyboru. M. Kidawa-Boska MKBlonska February 18, 2021 The party says it wants abortions to be available up to the 12th week for women who have an extremely difficult personal situation and after consultation with a psychologist and a doctor, reports Onet. In its package, PO also called for the state to guarantee sex education, free access to contraception and IVF, and prescription-free morning-after pills. PiS has opposed sex education, cut state funding for IVF, and made emergency contraceptives available only on prescription. We reject the radicalisms of the left and the right, tweeted the head of POs parliamentary caucus. We need a new social contract. However, media reports based on inside sources have suggested that there may be a rebellion from POs more conservative ranks over the new position of the leadership. Some are considering leaving the party completely, reports Wirtualna Polska. Odrzucamy radykalizmy z prawej i lewej strony. Potrzebujemy Nowej Umowy Spoecznej.

Conducted by Kantar for Polityka, the survey highlights that only 2% support the recent restrictive law, while 44% favor allowing abortion on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy, and 38% prefer the conditions allowed under the previous law. The previous regulations permitted abortions in cases where the pregnancy threatened the mother’s health or life, resulted from rape or incest, or involved severe fetal defects. The Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling eliminated the latter option, which accounted for nearly all legal abortions.

Public sentiment aligns closely with these findings, showing that 90% of respondents believe abortion should be permitted for fetuses with fatal defects, and 67% support it if the fetus has Down syndrome, though 27% oppose this. Protests against the ruling have been widespread, primarily in urban areas where 60% support abortion on demand. Younger respondents (18-24) are especially pro-choice, with 57% favoring abortion on demand, reflecting a broader shift among young Poles toward left-wing views.

The centrist Civic Platform (PO) recently revised its stance to advocate for returning to the previous legal framework with some liberalization, proposing to allow abortions up to the 12th week in “exceptional” cases and offering comprehensive reproductive health support, including sex education, free contraception, and IVF. However, this shift faces resistance from conservative members within PO.","['Polish', 'Poland', 'News In', 'Po p', '##ols', 'Politics Society', 'Energy', 'Law Media', 'Poland', 'VoiCEE', 'Advisory Board', 'Poland Foundation', 'Newslette', 'Poland', 'Newslette', 'Central and Eastern Europe Newslette', 'Polish', 'Poland', 'Poland', 'Civic Platform PO', 'Polityka', 'Polish', 'Constitutional Tribunal', 'Ben Stanley', '##DStan', 'Kantar', 'Polityka', 'Tribunal', 'Poland']","In her article “The Rights New Strategy to Fight Abortion Takes Aim at Doctors,” Dahlia Lithwick explores the shifting tactics of anti-abortion forces, who are increasingly targeting abortion providers instead of directly challenging women’s autonomy.

Solis By Emily Wagster Pettus and Leah Willingham Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print JACKSON, Miss. AP If you are Black or Hispanic in a conservative state that already limits access to abortions, you are far more likely than a white woman to have one.And if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to further restrict or even ban abortions, minority women will bear the brunt of it, according to statistics analyzed by The Associated Press.The numbers are unambiguous. In Mississippi, people of color comprise 44 of the population but 80 of women receiving abortions, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health statistics. In Texas, theyre 59 of the population and 74 of those receiving abortions. The numbers in Alabama are 35 and 70. In Louisiana, minorities represent 42 of the population, according to the state Health Department, and about 72 of those receiving abortions.Abortion restrictions are racist, said Cathy Torres, a 25-year-old organizing manager with Frontera Fund, a Texas organization that helps women pay for abortions. They directly impact people of color, Black, brown, Indigenous people . people who are trying to make ends meet. Why the great disparities? Laurie Bertram Roberts, executive director of the Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, which provides financial support for women seeking abortion, said women of color in states with restrictive abortion laws often have limited access to health care and a lack of choices for effective birth control. Schools often have ineffective or inadequate sex education. If abortions are outlawed, those same women often poor will likely have the hardest time traveling to distant parts of the country to terminate pregnancies or raising children they might struggle to afford, said Roberts, who is Black and once volunteered at Mississippis only abortion clinic. Were talking about folks who are already marginalized, Roberts said. Amanda Furdge, who is Black, was one of those women. She was a single, unemployed college student already raising one baby in 2014 when she found out she was pregnant with another. She said she didnt know how she could afford another child.Shed had two abortions in Chicago. Getting access to an abortion provider there was no problem, Furdge said. But now she was in Mississippi, having moved home to escape an abusive relationship. Misled by advertising, she first went to a crisis pregnancy center which tried to talk her out of an abortion. By the time she found the abortion clinic, she was too far along to have the procedure.Why cant you safely, easily access abortion here? asked Furdge, 34, who is happily raising her now 7-year-old son but continues to advocate for women having the right to choose.Torres said historically, anti-abortion laws have been crafted in ways that hurt low-income women. She pointed to the Hyde Amendment, a 1980 law that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except in rare cases.She also cited the 2021 Texas law that bans abortion after around six weeks of pregnancy. Where she lives, near the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley, women are forced to travel to obtain abortions and must pass in-state border patrol checkpoints where they have to disclose their citizenship status, she said. Regardless of what legislators say, Torres insisted, the intent is to target women of color, to control their bodies They know who these restrictions are going to affect. They know that, but they dont care. But Andy Gipson, a former member of the Mississippi Legislature who is now the states agriculture and commerce commissioner, said race had nothing to do with passage of Mississippis law against abortion after the 15th week. That law is now before the Supreme Court in a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the courts 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.Gipson, a Baptist minister who is white, said he believes all people are created in the image of God and have an innate value that starts at conception. Mississippi legislators were trying to protect women and babies by putting limits on abortion, he said. I absolutely disagree with the concept that its racist or about anything other than saving babies lives, said Gipson, a Republican. Its about saving lives of the unborn and the lives and health of the mother, regardless of what color they are.To those who say that forcing women to have babies will subject them to hardships, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a white Republican, said it is easier for working mothers to balance professional success and family life than it was 49 years ago when Roe was decided.Fitch, who is divorced, often points to her own experience of working outside the home while raising three children. But Fitch grew up in an affluent family and has worked in the legal profession both factors that can give working women the means and the flexibility to get help raising children. Thats not the case for many minority women in Mississippi or elsewhere. Advocates say in many places where abortion services are being curtailed, theres little support for women who carry a baby to term.Mississippi is one of the poorest states, and people in low-wage jobs often dont receive health insurance. Women can enroll in Medicaid during pregnancy, but that coverage disappears soon after they give birth. Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black infants were about twice as likely as white infants to die during the first year of life in Mississippi, according to the March of Dimes. Across the country, U.S. Census Bureau information analyzed by The Associated Press shows fewer Black and Hispanic women have health insurance, especially in states with tight abortion restrictions. For example, in Texas, Mississippi and Georgia, at least 16 of Black women and 36 of Latinas were uninsured in 2019, some of the highest such rates in the country.Problems are compounded in states without effective education programs about reproduction. Mississippi law says sex education in public schools must emphasize abstinence to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Discussion of abortion is forbidden, and instructors may not demonstrate how to use condoms or other contraception.The Mississippi director for Planned Parenthood Southeast, Tyler Harden, is a 26-year-old Black woman who had an abortion five years ago, an experience that drove her to a career supporting pregnant women and preserving abortion rights. She said when she was attending public school in rural Mississippi, she didnt learn about birth control. Instead, a teacher stuck clear tape on students arms. The girls were told to put it on another classmates arm, and another, and watch how it lost the ability to form a bond.Theyd tell you, If you have sex, this is who you are now Youre just like this piece of tape all used up and washed up and nobody would want it, Harden said.When she became pregnant at 21, she knew she wanted an abortion. Her mother was battling cancer and Harden was in her last semester of college without a job or a place to live after graduation. She said she was made to feel fear and shame, just as she had during sex ed classes. When she went to the clinic, she said protesters told her she was killing the most precious gift from God and that she was killing a Black baby, playing into what white supremacists want. Hardens experience is not uncommon. The anti-abortion movement has often portrayed the abortion fight in racial terms. Outside the only abortion clinic operating in Mississippi, protesters hand out brochures that refer to abortion as Black genocide and say the late Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood and a proponent of eugenics, desired to eradicate minorities. The brochures compare Sanger to Adolf Hitler and proclaim Black lives did not matter to Margaret Sanger! The Mississippi clinic is not affiliated with Planned Parenthood, and Planned Parenthood itself denounces Sangers belief in eugenics. White people are not alone in making this argument. Alveda King, an evangelist who is a niece of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is among the Black opponents of abortion who, for years, have been portraying abortion as a way to wipe out people of their race.Tanya Britton, a former president of Pro-Life Mississippi, often drives three hours from her home in the northern part of the state to pray outside the abortion clinic in Jackson. Britton is Black, and she said its a tragedy that the number of Black babies aborted since Roe would equal the population of several large cities. She also said people are too casual about terminating pregnancies.You just cant take the life of someone because this is not convenient I want to finish my education, Britton said. You wouldnt kill your 2-year-old because you were in graduate school.But state Rep. Zakiya Summers of Jackson, who is Black and a mother, suggested theres nothing casual about what poor women are doing. Receiving little support in Mississippi for example, the Legislature killed a proposal to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage in 2021 -- they are sometimes forced to make hard decisions. Women are just out here trying to survive, you know? she said. And Mississippi doesnt make it any easier.Associated Press reporters Noreen Nasir in Jackson, Mississippi, and Jasen Lo in Chicago contributed to this report.","The article highlights the disproportionate impact of abortion restrictions on minority women, particularly Black and Hispanic women, in conservative U.S. states with already limited abortion access. Statistics indicate that women of color, due to factors such as limited healthcare access, low wages, and ineffective sex education, are more likely to seek abortions than white women in these states. Leaders like Tyler Harden from Planned Parenthood argue that abortion restrictions disproportionately burden marginalized women, compounding economic and social disadvantages. This trend is reflected in states like Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama, where minority populations represent a large share of those needing abortions but face significant barriers to access.

The article also explores the anti-abortion movement’s racial dynamics, with some activists framing abortion as a form of racial genocide aimed at Black communities. Some Black anti-abortion advocates, such as Tanya Britton and Alveda King, argue that abortion harms the Black population, claiming that abortion rates in the community are akin to a loss of potential population growth. Critics of this view, however, argue that the movement is exploitative, noting that abortion restrictions place a greater burden on minority women who already face systemic inequities, including inadequate postnatal support and restrictive Medicaid policies.

While proponents of abortion restrictions, like Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, claim these laws protect life and support women, critics argue the policies are racially and economically unjust, disproportionately affecting low-income women who lack alternatives.","['AP', 'U', 'S', 'Israel', 'Hamas War Russia', 'Ukraine War', 'Asia Pacific', 'Latin', 'America', 'Europe Africa Middle East China Australia', 'Joe Biden Congress March Madness MLB NBA NHL NFL Soccer Golf Tennis AP', 'Associated Press', 'AP', 'AP', 'The Associated Press', 'AP', 'AP', 'Associated Press', 'Israel', 'Hamas', 'Unilever', 'Elon Musk', 'Mississippi', 'Planned Parenthood Southeast', 'Tyler Harden', 'Smith Park Jackson', 'Miss', 'AP', '##Rogelio V', 'Solis', 'Get', 'Israel', 'Jackson', 'Israel', 'AP', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', 'House']","The article highlights the disproportionate impact of abortion restrictions on minority women, especially in states with conservative laws that limit access to abortion services. The Associated Press analyzes statistics showing that Black and Hispanic women in states like Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama, which have restrictive abortion laws, are more likely to seek abortions compared to their white counterparts. In Mississippi, 44% of the population is people of color, but 80% of women receiving abortions are from these communities. Similarly, in Texas, 59% of the population is people of color, yet 74% of those seeking abortions are from these groups.

Advocates argue that abortion restrictions are rooted in racism and that they disproportionately affect low-income, marginalized communities who already face barriers such as inadequate access to healthcare, poor sex education, and lack of reproductive choices. Laurie Bertram Roberts of the Yellowhammer Fund points out that women of color often have limited healthcare access and face difficulties in traveling long distances to obtain abortions, especially in states with restrictive laws.

The article also shares personal stories, such as that of Amanda Furdge, a Black woman from Mississippi who struggled to access an abortion after moving back from Illinois. Additionally, Tyler Harden, a Black woman and director at Planned Parenthood Southeast in Mississippi, recalls her own abortion experience and how poor sex education contributed to her feeling of fear and shame. The article also mentions how the anti-abortion movement has targeted minority communities with messaging that equates abortion with “Black genocide.”

While some, like former Mississippi legislator Andy Gipson, argue that abortion restrictions are not racist but are instead aimed at saving lives, advocates counter that they fail to address the systemic issues, like poverty and inadequate healthcare, that minority women face.

The article concludes with a broader look at the lack of support for women in states with limited abortion access, particularly the lack of policies to support women who carry pregnancies to term, like Mississippi’s rejection of expanded postpartum Medicaid coverage. Despite these challenges, state Rep. Zakiya Summers emphasizes that the decision to seek an abortion is not made casually, but rather out of necessity for many women struggling to survive in an environment that does little to support them.",L,

Raquel gave birth to twin daughters with Zika syndrome in April 2016. I want to give my best to my daughters, she said in an interview with Human Rights Watch. 2017 Ueslei MarcelinoReuters As Covid-19 dominates headlines, the Zika virus silently continues to put women and children at grave risk in Brazil, and the country has not taken nearly enough steps to combat the mosquito-borne disease or help the families impacted by it. Brazils Ministry of Health identified 579 new suspected cases of Zika between December 2019 and February 2020. A Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other congenital conditions in infants. The 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil disproportionately affected women and girls and amplified longstanding human rights problems, including inadequate access to water and sanitation, unequal access to health care for the poorest families, and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. The governments response to the outbreak largely failed to address these problems, leaving women and girls at the diseases mercy when it returned. Thousands of infants in northeastern Brazil were born with disabilities linked to the virus and their families have been fighting for their rights ever since. Covid-19 has made matters worse, as states have focused on responding to the coronavirus and, at least in some locations, have cancelled in-person therapy for children affected by Zika. In April 2020, Brazils Supreme Court rejected on a technicality a petition that would have helped those families, without discussing its merits. The case sought access to state benefits, including medical care for families affected by Zika and preventive measures for at-risk populations, as well as access to contraceptives and the right for people infected during pregnancy to choose whether or not to continue their pregnancy. Abortion is legal in Brazil only in cases of rape, when necessary to preserve the life of the woman, or when the fetus has anencephaly. Many pregnant people have to choose between continuing dangerous or unwanted pregnancies or seeking unsafe methods to end them. Pregnant people need access to information and diagnostic tests that show whether a pregnancy could be impacted by Zika, and to safe, legal, and accessible abortion if they decide to end a pregnancy. Basic disease prevention remains out of reach for many Brazilians. More than one-third of Brazils 208 million people do not have access to a continuous water supply. This can be lethal, when frequent handwashing is a cornerstone of Covid-19 prevention and inadequately stored water in households without running water can breed mosquitoes that spread Zika. Brazil should respond to both Covid-19 and Zika by focusing on human rights such as rights to water, sanitation, and to access reproductive health information and services, including legal abortions, contraceptives and prenatal and birth care.

Between December 2019 and February 2020, Brazil reported 579 new suspected Zika cases, which can result in congenital disabilities like microcephaly in infants if contracted during pregnancy. The initial 2015-2016 Zika outbreak revealed systemic problems in Brazil, including poor access to sanitation, healthcare disparities, and limited reproductive rights, particularly affecting marginalized women and girls.

COVID-19 has exacerbated these challenges, diverting resources from Zika response efforts and interrupting essential services for affected families, such as in-person therapy for children with Zika-related disabilities. Furthermore, the Brazilian Supreme Court recently dismissed a petition for expanded support and preventive measures for Zika-impacted families, which sought broader access to medical care, contraceptives, and the right to safe and legal abortion for those affected during pregnancy. Currently, Brazilian law restricts abortion to cases of rape, risks to the mother’s life, or when the fetus has anencephaly, forcing some women into unsafe alternatives.

Lack of basic resources compounds the crisis, with over a third of Brazilians lacking reliable access to water—a necessity for preventing both COVID-19 and Zika. Human Rights Watch calls on Brazil to address these intertwined public health crises through a human rights approach, including improving water and sanitation access and expanding reproductive health services.","['Zika', 'Brazil', 'Co', '##vid', '19 Human Rights Watch', 'Human Rights Watch', 'English', 'Fr', 'De', '##uts', '##ug', '##us Espaol', '##ate', 'Zika', 'Brazil', 'Covid', '19', 'Ximena Casas', ""Women ' s Rights Division"", 'Facebook', 'WhatsApp', 'LinkedI', 'Red', 'Raquel', 'Heloisa', 'Areia', 'Paraba', 'Brazil', 'Raquel', 'Zika', 'Human Rights Watch', 'Ueslei Marcelino', 'Covid', '19', 'Zika', 'Brazil', 'Brazil', 'Ministry of Health', 'Zika', 'Zika', 'Zika', 'Brazil', 'Brazil']","In the report titled New Zika Cases in Brazil Overshadowed by Covid-19, Human Rights Watch highlights the ongoing impact of the Zika virus in Brazil, which is being overshadowed by the Covid-19 pandemic. From December 2019 to February 2020, Brazil reported 579 new suspected Zika cases, primarily affecting women, especially during pregnancy. Zika infections during pregnancy can lead to severe birth defects, including microcephaly.

The Zika crisis, which had a significant outbreak in 2015-2016, revealed longstanding human rights issues, such as poor access to water, sanitation, and healthcare, particularly in poorer regions. The Brazilian government’s inadequate response to the initial outbreak left women and children vulnerable when the virus resurfaced. Families in northeastern Brazil, where many babies were born with Zika-related disabilities, continue to struggle for their rights.

Covid-19 has worsened the situation by diverting attention and resources away from Zika, with some services for children affected by the virus being canceled. In April 2020, Brazil’s Supreme Court dismissed a petition that sought state support for Zika-affected families, including access to medical care, contraceptives, and the right to choose abortion in cases of Zika exposure. While abortion is only legal in Brazil under specific circumstances (rape, risk to the woman’s life, or anencephaly), many women are left with unsafe alternatives.

Additionally, more than a third of Brazil’s population lacks consistent access to clean water, which is essential for preventing both Covid-19 and Zika. The report calls for a human rights-based response to both pandemics, focusing on the rights to water, sanitation, reproductive health services, and legal abortion.

The Human Rights Watch report stresses the need for Brazil to address these systemic issues, especially in light of the continuing challenges posed by the Zika virus, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.",L,

ADVERTISEMENTAn EU equality official has criticised the Polish government's decision to ban almost all circumstances of abortion - a decision that has also sparked the country's biggest protests in its post-communist era.Helena Dalli, a Maltese politician serving as equality commissioner, reminded a European Parliament hearing on Wednesday that member states ""must respect fundamental rights.""""As you are well aware, the EU has no competence on abortion rights within a member state and thus, abortion legislation is up to the member states concerned,"" Dalli said. ""However, when making use of the competences, member states must respect fundamental rights which bind them by virtue of the constitutions and commitments under international law.It is also worth noting that both the Council of Europe human rights commissioner, and a group of UN human rights special mechanisms, have expressed the opinion that this substantial restriction to legal access to abortion goes against Poland's international human rights obligations.""The Polish side, however, defended its decision, with representative Andrzej Marek Sados saying it was the ""exclusive responsibility"" of a state to regulate what constitutes a legal termination.He said ""In the Polish legal system, courts and tribunals are an authority that is separate and independent from other authorities. Nonetheless, I would like to point out that in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, health policy remains a competence of the member states.""And it is also the exclusive responsibility of the member states to regulate the issue of the admissibility of the legal termination of pregnancy.""Marta Lempart is the leader of the Polish Women's StrikeCzarek SokolowskiAPThe hearing on Wednesday was also attended by the European Parliament Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality, FEMM, among other committees, and comes after Poland's landmark ruling last year.In October, the Polish constitutional court found it illegal to abort foetuses that have congenital defects.This officially took effect earlier this, making the majority of abortions in Poland illegal.For instance, in 2019, around 98 of all legal abortions were performed on the grounds of foetal malformations.A woman can now only seek a termination legally under Polish law if her life or health is at risk, or if her pregnancy is result of rape or incest.'Bring the government to court'Marta Lempart, a leader of the Polish Women's Strike and who is facing charges for her role in the recent protests, has urged the EU to act and to sanction the Polish government.""Dear European politicians, I am not asking for your concern,"" she said.

This law has made most abortions illegal, allowing them only if the mother’s life or health is at risk, or in cases of rape or incest. The EU’s equality commissioner, Helena Dalli, emphasized that while abortion laws are under national jurisdiction, member states must still uphold fundamental rights as outlined by international law. The Council of Europe and UN representatives have also stated that Poland’s restrictions violate international human rights standards.

Poland defended its stance, with a representative asserting that abortion regulation is a sovereign right and that health policies fall under each member state’s control per EU treaties. However, activists like Marta Lempart of the Polish Women’s Strike have urged the EU to impose sanctions on Poland, calling for a stronger stance to defend the rights of European citizens. Lempart argued that EU officials have a duty to protect fundamental rights and urged them to act decisively against Poland’s policies.

The ongoing debate underscores tensions within the EU over national sovereignty versus adherence to shared European values and human rights commitments.","['EU', 'Poland', 'Eurone', 'English English', 'EU', 'Brussels', 'Europe', 'Union', 'C', 'Europe', 'Euro', 'Eurone', 'Qatar', 'World News', 'Japan', 'Dub', 'Eurone', 'Us', 'Soul Of', 'South', 'Saudi', 'Dubai', 'Estonia', 'Sharjah', 'Azerbaijan', 'Qatar', 'Spain', 'Uzbekistan', 'Greece', 'Classic Piano Competition', 'Garden City', 'Kerala', 'Ron Barcel', 'Wine Of', 'Moldova', 'EU', 'Euro', 'EU', 'Poland', 'Euro']","The European Union (EU) has criticized Poland’s decision to ban nearly all abortions, reminding member states of their obligation to respect fundamental rights. The issue arose following a controversial ruling by the Polish Constitutional Court in October 2020, which deemed abortions due to congenital defects illegal. The law took effect earlier in 2021, making most abortions illegal in Poland. The only exceptions are if the woman’s life or health is at risk, or in cases of rape or incest.

Helena Dalli, the EU’s Equality Commissioner, emphasized that while the EU does not have the power to legislate on abortion, it requires member states to uphold human rights. She noted that both the Council of Europe and UN human rights bodies have expressed concern that Poland’s new law violates international human rights standards.

In response, Poland defended its position, arguing that the regulation of abortion is a matter for individual states under the EU treaties, and the country’s courts are independent in their decisions.

Structural racism has always posed formidable barriers to health care for Black people. Black Maternal Health Week highlights a hard truth Black womens needs have never been prioritized, leading to disparate, inequitable health outcomes. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic devastates Black communities across the country, that truth is all the more glaring. ""Time and again, a state or county releases racial data. Time and again, those numbers reveal a sizable racial disparity. Time and again, black Americans are overrepresented among the infected and dead,"" DrIbram writes The Atlantic TheAtlantic April 6, 2020 For Black people, impending motherhood can feel fraught even in normal times because during and after childbirth, their health and lives are on the line. At over 40 deaths per 100,000 live births, the maternal mortality rate for Black women is more than three times higher than that of white women. The work of organizations such as the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, SisterSong, The National Birth Equity Collaborative and other Black-led reproductive justice organizations have brought the Black maternal health crisis to national attention. Since the first commemoration of Black Maternal Health Week in 2018, these organizations efforts have led to the introduction of more than a dozen bills in Congress to rectify the challenges and systemic bias that too often lead to poor maternal health outcomes for Black mamas. Join us by urging your member of Congress to support the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020 introduced by Reps. Lauren Underwood D-Ill. and Alma Adams D-N.C., Sen. Kamala Harris D-Ca., and members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. Among a comprehensive set of regulations and investments to address the crisis in Black womens maternal mortality, the Momnibus Act will compile data on the underlying social determinants that lead to higher mortality rates to address the racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes among Black women in America. The bill is endorsed by over 90 reproductive rights and justice organizations, including Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Planned Parenthood, and Black Womens Health Imperative. While Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health and rights groups have fought targeted attacks against reproductive health care, we recognize that the bulk of the groundbreaking work to defend access to care has been done by reproductive justice organizations and leaders on the ground. Heroes like Dr. Joia Crear-Perry of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, Angela Aina of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Monica Simpson of SisterSong, and Kwajelyn Jackson of the Feminist Womens Health Center have lived and led the work to eradicate disparities and save Black womens lives. We will never have health equity without the reproductive justice framework theyve built. It is clear that the leading cause of Black maternal mortality is racism Studies show link medical professionals tend to take Black women's health concerns less seriously. Anecdotal evidence suggests a pattern of mistreatment and inattention to Black women by medical professionals. Compared to white women, Black women are more likely to have serious complications resulting from pregnancy and less likely to have conditions diagnosed, monitored, and treated in a timely manner. For many Black women, the addition of a doula or similar supporting provider to advocate on behalf of the patient during pregnancy and delivery has improved their health outcomes. Yet COVID-19 has compelled many hospitals to limit the presence of support providers from delivery rooms which may exacerbate existing disparities and increase incidences of mistreatment by providers towards patients. Compared to white women, Black women are more likely to have serious complications resulting from pregnancy and less likely to have conditions diagnosed, monitored, and treated in a timely manner. Racism in the workplace, when accessing housing, in educational settings, and in other community settings the social determinants of health negatively affects Black people. In recent research conducted by Planned Parenthood, Black respondents were most likely to report difficulty paying for basic necessities like food, housing, medical care, and heating. The stress of dealing with racism on a daily basis makes Black women more susceptible to heart disease, high blood pressure, and other chronic health conditions known to contribute to poor maternal health outcomes. What we must also take into account Attacks on access to sexual and reproductive health care also have a disproportionate impact on Black women. The Trump-Pence administration has taken unprecedented steps to roll back access to abortion, block patients from seeking care from the provider of their choice, and institute other restrictions on reproductive health care for millions of people in this country. But obstacles to access are nothing new to Black women, who disproportionately live in states that had barriers to sexual and reproductive health care well before Trump became president. Given the strong link between reproductive health care access and maternal health outcomes, it comes as little surprise that many of those states such as Texas and Georgia also have some of the nations highest maternal death rates. While policymakers work with health care leaders and others to make health care more accessible and affordable for people directly affected by COVID-19, they must pay attention to the causes of death and inequities that affect the Black community even during this pandemic. When we center the communities and people most impacted by health care crises, everyone benefits. These are challenging times, but were in this together. Lets commit to improving the health and wellness of Black mamas, their families, and their communities during this pandemic and beyond.

Black Maternal Health Week 2020 underscores the longstanding inequities Black women face in accessing equitable healthcare, contributing to maternal mortality rates more than three times higher than for white women.

Organizations like Black Mamas Matter Alliance and the National Birth Equity Collaborative advocate for systemic change and have pushed for legislative solutions, such as the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020. This Act, supported by numerous reproductive justice groups, aims to collect data on social determinants affecting maternal health, improve healthcare services, and address disparities specific to Black women.

Racism within healthcare is a significant contributor to these disparities; Black women’s health concerns are often minimized or ignored, leading to higher rates of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Support from doulas has proven beneficial, yet COVID-19 restrictions have limited access to these advocates, increasing risks during childbirth. Additionally, the daily stress of navigating racism exacerbates chronic conditions like hypertension and heart disease, which can impact pregnancy outcomes.

Black women face heightened obstacles to sexual and reproductive health care, with policies in states such as Texas and Georgia imposing stringent limitations that correlate with higher maternal mortality rates. The Trump administration’s actions to restrict abortion and reproductive health services have compounded these challenges.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of centering the voices and needs of Black communities in healthcare discussions. Improving health equity for Black mothers and families can lead to better outcomes for all. Planned Parenthood and other reproductive justice organizations are committed to supporting Black maternal health, advocating for policy changes, and addressing the systemic issues underlying these disparities.","['Black', '##tion Law', 'Pa', '##hood', '##tion Laws', 'Black', 'Sharn Haywood', 'Black Mat', '##al Health Week', 'COVID - 19', 'Black', 'Black Mat', '##al Health Week', 'Black', 'COVID - 19', 'Black', 'Americans', '##Ibram', 'The Atlantic TheA', 'Black', 'Black', 'Black', 'Alliance', 'National', 'Black', 'Black', 'Black', 'Week', 'Congress', 'Black', 'Congress', 'Black Mat']","The article emphasizes the urgent need for attention to Black maternal health, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated existing health disparities. Structural racism has historically posed barriers to healthcare access for Black people, leading to disproportionately high maternal mortality rates among Black women—over three times higher than that of white women. This alarming statistic is underscored during Black Maternal Health Week, an event initiated in 2018 to address these issues.

Organizations such as the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, SisterSong, and the National Birth Equity Collaborative have been instrumental in bringing this crisis to the forefront, advocating for systemic changes, and driving legislation like the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020. This comprehensive bill seeks to collect data on social determinants of health that contribute to high maternal mortality rates and reduce racial disparities in maternal health outcomes. It is backed by over 90 reproductive rights and justice organizations, including Planned Parenthood.

The article highlights that racism in healthcare, where Black women’s concerns are often dismissed or not treated with the urgency they deserve, is a major factor in poor maternal health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further worsened this issue, with many hospitals restricting support providers like doulas, which could have helped improve health outcomes. Racism in broader societal settings, such as the workplace and education, also contributes to chronic stress, which negatively impacts health, making Black women more susceptible to conditions like heart disease and high blood pressure, both of which are linked to maternal health complications.

Further exacerbating the problem are attacks on reproductive healthcare access, particularly during the Trump administration, which rolled back abortion access and other essential reproductive health services. States like Texas and Georgia, which already had high maternal mortality rates, saw their Black communities disproportionately affected by these restrictions.

The article calls for continued efforts to improve healthcare equity and support the Black maternal health movement, urging policymakers to prioritize the needs of communities most impacted by health crises. It concludes with a call for collective action to improve the health and well-being of Black mothers, their families, and communities, especially during the ongoing pandemic.",L,

Activists hold placards as they protest in Warsaw against the abortion ban. Alexey VitvitskySputnik via AP CNN Police in Poland used pepper spray against demonstrators after hundreds gathered in the capital of Warsaw to protest a near-total ban on abortions. Polands highest court ruled Thursday that abortions due to fetal defects were unconstitutional. Around 98 of abortions in Poland had been conducted as a result of fetal defects, meaning the ruling bans virtually all terminations taking place in the country. The country already has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe and will now only allow a termination in cases of rape, incest or when the mothers life in danger. The ruling sparked furious protests in the country. On Friday riot police cracked down on crowds which gathered near the home of the ruling Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Kaczynski is the countrys Deputy Prime Minister and widely seen as the de facto decision maker in Poland, despite not being the Prime Minister or President. The move to further restrict abortion had been pursued by Polands populist government for months. Demonstrators gather on July 24, 2020, to protest against plans by the Polish government to leave the Istanbul Convention.

In a second video a group of police officers are seen arresting a protester while another group of officers wrestles with a demonstrator as they try to take him away. A Warsaw police spokesman said Friday that police arrested 15 people at the protests, 14 of whom have been now been released. Authorities issued 35 fine and filed 89 motions in court. Rights groups have reacted with horror to the Polish courts abortion ruling. On Thursday, Amnesty International called the ruling a cruel judgment, saying it was the result of a coordinated, systemic wave of attacks on womens human rights. Legal prohibitions on abortion do not prevent abortion or reduce the rates of abortion they serve only to damage womens health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to travel to foreign countries to access abortion care they need and to which they have a right, Amnesty said in a statement.

The court’s decision declared abortions due to fetal defects unconstitutional, effectively banning the majority of abortions, as 98% of them in Poland had been performed for this reason. This ruling has sparked widespread protests, especially as Poland already has some of Europe’s strictest abortion laws. Abortion will now only be permitted in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is at risk.

The protests have been met with a heavy police response, including the use of pepper spray and arrests. Authorities detained 15 protesters, releasing most of them shortly after. The ruling has drawn criticism from human rights organizations, with Amnesty International calling it a “cruel judgment” and warning that such legal restrictions will only harm women’s health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to seek services abroad. The government’s move is seen as part of a broader, months-long effort by Poland’s populist government to further restrict abortion access.","['Warsaw', 'Poland', 'CNN CNN', 'World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'US', 'Arabic', 'CNN', 'US', 'Congress', 'Bell', 'US', 'Olympics', 'Hockey Digital Studios CNN', 'CNN', 'Earth', 'World', 'Africa', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'Warsaw', 'Poland', 'Artur Osinski', 'Zahi', 'CNN', 'Warsaw', 'CNN', 'Poland', 'Warsaw', 'Poland', 'Poland']","In response to a ruling by Poland’s highest court banning almost all abortions, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Warsaw, protesting the decision. The court’s ruling declared that abortions due to fetal defects were unconstitutional, effectively banning the vast majority of abortions, as around 98% of procedures in Poland were carried out due to fetal abnormalities. This new restriction means that abortions are now only allowed in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk.

The Polish government, led by the populist Law and Justice Party and Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had been pursuing tighter abortion laws for months.

Wade overturnedLinley SandersData Journalist Politics current affairs Health science March 04, 2020, 830 PM GMT0 Share Printable version On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since President Donald Trump appointed two conservative justices to the nations highest court. The case, June Medical Services v. Russo, will ask the Court to decide whether to uphold a Louisiana state law that requires abortion providers to secure hospital admitting privileges.If the case is upheld, access to abortion would be limited in Louisiana, and other anti-abortion laws would likely be passed in other parts of the country. The court case and the Courts reshaped ideology raises questions about whether the Supreme Court will eventually reevaluate the landmark case that legalized abortion Roe v. Wade. Yet a plurality of Americans even people who call themselves pro-life don't necessarily want Roe overturned, according to a YouGov survey of more than 17,000 Americans.In 1973, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas state law banning all abortion. The decision, also called Roe v. Wade, effectively legalized the procedure nationwide during a woman's first trimester. In the last 47 years, Americans have grown accustomed to the law, and by two to one 49 vs 25, Americans say they do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned.Many somewhat pro-lifers want to keep Roe v. WadeUnderstanding Americans stance on Roe v. Wade is not as simple as looking at their opinion on abortion. Americans who call themselves somewhat pro-life subvert the idea that supporting access to abortion is simply polarized along pro-life and pro-choice lines. For Americans who consider themselves somewhat pro-life, a little more than one-third 37 want Roe upheld and about one-third 33 want it overturned. Three in ten 30 are uncertain of their opinion. But a majority of Americans who call themselves strongly pro-choice or somewhat pro-choice are certain that they do not want Roe v. Wade reversed. Similarly, a majority of those who call themselves strongly pro-life are certain that they do want it overturned. One key trait distinguishes these somewhat pro-lifers from strong pro-lifers somewhat pro-lifers are less likely to be religious than the strongly pro-life. A majority of those who are strongly pro-life 59 say they practice a religion, compared to almost half that number 32 for somewhat pro-lifers. About a quarter 25 of somewhat pro-lifers say they do not belong to a religion, compared to 15 percent of strongly pro-life people.Religious Americans split on whether Roe should be overturnedStrongly pro-life Americans are more likely than the general population to be religious, but not all religious groups want to overturn Roe v. Wade. While Americans who belong to prominent religious groups are generally more likely to want Roe v. Wade overturned when compared to Americans overallits not a guarantee. About half of Roman Catholics 49 say they are either strongly pro-life 31 or somewhat pro-life 18. But despite the fact that Roman Catholics are more likely than the general public to call themselves pro-life, a plurality 43 of Roman Catholics do not want Roe v. Wade overturned. Only one-third of Roman Catholics 31 want it overturned.This pattern generally follows among popular Protestant religions, as well. Americans who put themselves under the umbrella of Protestantism consider themselves more strongly pro-life than the general population 41 vs. 27. But Protestants overall are split on whether Roe v Wade should be overturned 38 percent believe it should and 38 percent believe it should not.There are also denominations of Protestantism that consider themselves more pro-choice than pro-life, primarily the United Church of Christ 67, Episcopalians 65, Methodists 55, Presbyterians 54, and Lutherans 52. Pluralities of each of these religious denominations do not want Roe overturned. In contrast, Nondenominational Americans 61 and Baptists 55 are more likely to consider themselves pro-life than pro-choice. Even with that majority of pro-lifers, fewer than half 45 of Nondenominational Americans want Roe v Wade overturned. Baptists are split on whether it should be overturned or not 34 vs 36.How the states view Roe v. WadeAt the state level, lawmakers often propose abortion-related legislation that could trigger a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade. But even in the US states where residents identify as the most strongly pro-life, a plurality does not want Roe overturned. In Louisiana, the state that will send the Supreme Court its upcoming case June Medical Services v. Gee a plurality also wants to maintain Roe v. Wade. About three in ten 28 want the decision overturned, while about two in five 39 want it maintained.Among US states where the most residents identify as somewhat pro-life or strongly pro-life are Arkansas 53, Kentucky 51, South Carolina 50, Utah 50, Missouri 49, and North Carolina 47. In each of them, there is at least a seven-point gap where more people want to see Roe v. Wade upheld, rather than overturned.Related What the Confederate flag means in America todayMethodology Total weighted sample size was 17,456 US adults aged 18. Participants were asked, Would you or would you not like to see Roe v. Wade the 1973 case which effectively legalized abortion in the US overturned by the Supreme Court? Response options were I would like it to be overturned, I would not like it to be overturned, or Dont know. Survey conducted from January 3 - 5, 2020. This was cross-referenced with a question asked of 6,730 US adults, Thinking about abortion, do you consider yourself more pro-choice or more pro-life? Response options were strongly pro-choice, somewhat pro-choice, somewhat pro-life, and strongly pro-life. The responding samples are weighted to provide a representative sample of the United States.

All Rights ReservedPrivacy and cookie policyTerms and conditionsDo Not Sell My Info","A YouGov survey of over 17,000 Americans reveals that most Americans, including many who identify as pro-life, do not want the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision overturned. The survey highlights that 49% of Americans oppose overturning Roe, while only 25% support it. The case at hand, June Medical Services v. Russo, will determine whether a Louisiana law limiting abortion access should be upheld, potentially influencing other states’ abortion laws and triggering debates about revisiting Roe v. Wade.

The survey also shows nuanced views among Americans who consider themselves pro-life. Among those who identify as “somewhat pro-life,” about 37% wish to keep Roe v. Wade intact, while 33% want it overturned, and 30% remain uncertain. In contrast, those who strongly identify as pro-choice or somewhat pro-choice overwhelmingly oppose overturning Roe. A significant divide exists between strongly pro-life Americans, who tend to be more religious, and the somewhat pro-life group, who are less likely to be religious.

Religious Americans, particularly Catholics and Protestants, are more likely to lean towards pro-life positions, but even among these groups, opinions on Roe v. Wade are mixed. Roman Catholics, for instance, are divided on the issue, with 43% opposing the overturn and 31% supporting it. The survey also indicates that even in traditionally pro-life states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and Kentucky, a plurality of residents support upholding Roe.

The findings suggest that Americans’ views on abortion are complex, with many wanting to maintain Roe v. Wade while supporting certain restrictions on abortion. This survey, conducted from January 3-5, 2020, reflects the broader debate surrounding abortion and the potential for significant legal shifts depending on future Supreme Court decisions.","['America', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'YouGov', 'US Australia France Germany Italy Spain Singapore Switzerland United Kingdom Vietnam', 'YouGov', 'YouGov', 'YouGov', 'YouGov', 'YouGov']","A YouGov survey of over 17,000 Americans reveals that a majority do not want the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide, to be overturned. Despite ongoing debates on abortion, Americans are divided on the issue, with 49% opposed to overturning Roe v. Wade and only 25% in favor.

The survey also highlights the complexity of Americans’ views on abortion, with many people identifying as “somewhat pro-life” rather than strictly pro-life or pro-choice. Among those who consider themselves somewhat pro-life, roughly one-third want the ruling upheld, another third want it overturned, and 30% are unsure. In contrast, the majority of strongly pro-choice Americans want Roe v. Wade maintained, as do a significant portion of somewhat pro-choice individuals.

Religious affiliation also influences opinions. While more religious Americans, particularly Protestants, are inclined to oppose abortion, the survey shows that not all religious groups want Roe v. Wade overturned. Roman Catholics and various Protestant denominations are split on the issue, with some denominations, like the United Church of Christ and Episcopalians, more supportive of maintaining Roe v. Wade.

At the state level, even in regions with a higher number of pro-life supporters, such as Louisiana and Arkansas, there is a notable preference for keeping Roe v. Wade intact. For instance, in Louisiana, where the Supreme Court is set to hear a case related to abortion, more people want to preserve the decision than overturn it.

In summary, while abortion remains a highly contentious issue in America, public opinion leans against overturning Roe v. Wade, with even many pro-life individuals favoring its continuation, especially among those less religious.",L,

Abortion providers say thatll help expand access in rural Kansas, but the legal fight isnt over. WICHITA, Kansas Kansas women could soon be able to seek abortion pills through telemedicine appointments after a judge blocked a state law banning the practice.Abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the decision will help expand access to abortion for people across the state, particularly in areas like western Kansas that might be several hours from the nearest clinic. The states five clinics are clustered around Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas.The decision paves the way for Kansas abortion clinics to expand services to women in remote, underserved areas of Kansas, said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. The legal status of telemedicine abortion has been tied up in Kansas courts for years, since the Center for Reproductive Rights and Wichita-based clinic Trust Women challenged a 2011 law requiring doctors to be in the same room as patients when prescribing abortion-inducing medication.Last week, Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson granted a temporary injunction barring enforcement of the law. It follows her earlier ruling this summer denying an injunction, which an appellate court overturned.While the legal fight is likely to continue in the Kansas court system, the decision will allow Kansas clinics to offer telemedicine abortion services. Existing restrictions including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and parental consent rules for minors will still apply.Access to telemedicine services for Kansans will go a long way to easing the strain on our reproductive health care systems in the state, Trust Women co-executive director Rebecca Tong said in a statement.Anti-abortion advocates said theyre disappointed by the decision.While its disappointing, its certainly not surprising, said Jeanne Gawdun, director of government relations with Kansans for Life. Its just one of the many limits that are protective for women and their children that abortion providers have fought and will continue to fight.The group said legal challenges to abortion laws like this are possible because voters rejected a constitutional amendment in August that would have stripped abortion protections from the state constitution.It might still be several months before Kansas clinics begin offering telemedicine abortion services.Theres still some infrastructure that needs to be developed in order to successfully roll out a quality telehealth abortion care program, Trust Women spokesperson Zachary Gingrich-Gaylord said.He said the clinic continues to be inundated by out-of-state patients seeking appointments.Right now, our Wichita clinic is focused on trying to see as many people in clinic as possible, he said. We're still receiving far more phone calls than we can answer in a given day.Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates three Kansas clinics, didnt immediately say whether or when it might offer telemedicine abortion services in the future.We applaud this step towards increasing accessibility to abortion services and continue to evaluate our next steps, president and CEO Emily Wales said in a statement.Medication abortion, or the use of the drugs to end a pregnancy, accounts for over two thirds of abortions in Kansas, according to the state health department. Mifepristone and misoprostol, which are often used together, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to end pregnancies up to 10 weeks.Some Kansans have skirted the states telemedicine ban by using overseas pharmacies and mail-forwarding services. Online orders of abortion pills from Europe-based pharmacy Aid Access from Kansas doubled between May and August of this year, according to data released earlier this month.Experts say the rise could be tied to increased difficulty in obtaining abortion appointments in Kansas following the U.S. Supreme Court decision this summer overturning Roe v. Wade, which spurred a wave of abortion bans across the country and sent out-of-state patients to Kansas clinics.Banning telehealth for medication abortion had been something that conservative states had glommed on to starting about a decade ago, said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.Besides Kansas, 18 states have laws banning telemedicine abortions in effect, many of which also ban abortion in most cases. Only seven other states ban telemedicine abortion in instances where it would be legal in person.Kansas is a fairly critical state for abortion access in the country, Nash said. While the decision in this case is very important its also not the end of the road. The case is not finished, and theres certainly more thats going to happen in the Legislature around abortion in the coming years.Rose Conlon reports on health for KMUW and the Kansas News Service.

The law had been challenged by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Wichita clinic Trust Women, which claimed it restricted access to abortion, especially in regions far from the state’s five clinics, clustered in Wichita and Kansas City.

Judge Teresa Watson’s temporary injunction halts the law’s enforcement, although the legal battle is expected to continue. While telemedicine abortion services are now allowed, existing restrictions like a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent for minors remain in place. Abortion rights groups view this as a significant step, especially in a state where medication abortion makes up over two-thirds of all abortions.

However, anti-abortion groups expressed disappointment, calling the decision a setback in protecting women and children. They also noted that the legal challenges were influenced by voters rejecting a constitutional amendment that would have stripped abortion protections in August.

The decision could take months to fully implement as clinics work to establish telemedicine abortion infrastructure. Additionally, some Kansans have already circumvented the telemedicine ban by ordering abortion pills from overseas pharmacies. Despite the ruling, abortion rights groups recognize that the fight for access to reproductive healthcare in Kansas is far from over, as legislative challenges and legal proceedings are likely to continue.","['Kansas', 'KCUR', 'Kansas City', 'NPR', 'KCUR', 'Kansas City', 'History', 'Kansas City', 'M', 'Hermon Mehari', 'Co', 'Kansas City', 'Kansas', 'Kansas City', 'KC Media Collective Midwest Newsroom Kansas News Service Harvest Public Media', 'RadioActive', 'Aviva', 'KCUR', 'KCUR', 'KCUR', 'KCUR', 'KCUR Audio - Reader Network', 'Fish Fry', 'History', 'KC', 'RadioActive', 'Ari Shapiro', 'KC', 'Kansas City Public Radio', 'NPR', 'Kansas City', 'KC', 'Kansas', 'K', 'Rose Conlon', 'Celia Llopis', 'Jepsen', 'Kansas', 'Kansas', 'Kansas Kansas', 'Kansas', 'Wichita', 'Kansas City', 'Kansas', 'Kansas', 'Kansas', 'North']","In November 2022, a Kansas judge temporarily blocked a state law that prohibited doctors from prescribing abortion pills via telemedicine. The law’s suspension is seen as a victory for abortion rights advocates, especially for women in rural areas like western Kansas, where clinics are scarce. This decision allows Kansas clinics to offer telemedicine abortion services, which had been restricted since a 2011 law requiring in-person consultations for prescribing abortion-inducing medications. The Center for Reproductive Rights and Trust Women, a Wichita-based clinic, had challenged the law in court, and Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson granted the injunction, halting the law’s enforcement.

While the decision is significant, the legal battle is ongoing, and anti-abortion groups like Kansans for Life have expressed disappointment, signaling that challenges to abortion laws could continue, especially after voters rejected a constitutional amendment in August 2022 that sought to strip abortion protections. Legal experts note that Kansas is a critical state for abortion access, and the fight is far from over.

Medication abortion, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all abortions in Kansas, typically involves two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, to terminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks. Some residents have already sought abortion pills from overseas sources like Aid Access. Despite this, the legal status of telemedicine abortion remains in flux, with Kansas being one of 19 states that had banned such services.

In addition to legal challenges, practical concerns remain about implementing telemedicine abortion programs in Kansas clinics. Although Planned Parenthood Great Plains has not yet indicated when it might offer such services, the decision provides a potential pathway for expanding access to reproductive healthcare, particularly in underserved areas.",L,
"A year after Roe v. Wade overturned, abortion rights advocacy groups keep fighting ‚Ä¢ Louisiana Illuminator","A year after Roe v. Wade overturned, abortion rights advocacy groups keep fighting Louisiana Illuminator HOME NEWS Election 2024 Govt Politics Environment Health Criminal Justice Education Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 930 News Story CourtsGovt PoliticsHealth Policy A year after Roe v. Wade overturned, abortion rights advocacy groups keep fighting By Josie Abugov, Verite - June 26, 2023 930 am Protestors march toward City Hall in New Orleans to protest the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling June 24, 2022, that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Louisiana is now trying to develop a list of conditions that would warrant an abortion, despite the states abortion ban. Piper HutchinsonLouisiana Illuminator NEW ORLEANS In its nearly 40 years of existence, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has never offered abortions in Louisiana. The state never authorized the organizations two clinics one in New Orleans and one in Baton Rouge to do so. Planned Parenthood began construction for its South Claiborne Avenue facility in 2015. Its first location, which opened in 1984 on Magazine Street, did not meet the legal code for a facility to provide abortions, so the organization decided to build a new clinic that did. That aim never came to fruition, and the construction process itself was tumultuous. Anti-abortion advocates and the Archdiocese of New Orleans protested and threatened Planned Parenthood. The archbishop even published an open letter vowing not to enter into business relationships with any person or organization that participates in actions that are essential to making this abortion facility a reality. After a controversial building period, the New Orleans Planned Parenthood clinic opened in 2016 and applied for a license under Gov. John Bel Edwards, an anti-abortion Democrat. Planned Parenthood said it heard no response. They never denied it, but they never gave us our license, said Petrice Sams-Abiodun, the vice president of strategic partnerships at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion access in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health, giving the states the authority to ban abortion. The decision overturned a longstanding national right to abortion established in the 1972 Roe v. Wade decision. The decision allowed Louisianas trigger law banning nearly all abortions to take effect immediately, making New Orleans Planned Parenthoods push for a license to perform abortions moot. Before Roe, Louisiana was already an abortion desert In the 40 years between the Roe and Dobbs decisions, Louisiana lawmakers had passed 89 restrictions to abortion access, more than any other state. In 2006, the state legislature passed the trigger ban that would ultimately go into effect with the court ruling 16 years later. The state also instituted a policy banning Medicaid providers from offering abortions, a law that Sams-Abiodun described as a catch-22, since almost 70 percent of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast patients receive Medicaid. There are currently zero abortion clinics operating in Louisiana after the Dobbs decision. But the number had already been dwindling for decades. In 1992, there were 17 clinics. Then, there were 11, then five, then three. We have always looked to the national government. Weve always looked to Roe in Louisiana to be a buffer for us, so that we could have access, even though it was very limited, Sams-Abiodun said. And when that fell, we didnt have anything else. With three abortion clinics in Louisiana prior to the Dobbs ruling, the state was already an abortion desert, but Planned Parenthood could connect patients seeking the procedure to a facility in the state. After the ruling, they expanded an initiative that they had started in Texas to also help people get care outside of Louisiana. We have staff that are specially trained to look at, How far along is the pregnancy? Do you need travel support? Do you want to take a flight? Do you want to drive? Sam-Abiodun said. All these barriers, now, with these laws, are put on the individual. By working with the Planned Parenthood national office and the Louisiana Coalition for Reproductive Freedom an umbrella organization with 30 partners Sams-Abiodun said Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has helped more than 1,500 Louisianians and Texans access out-of-state abortion care. In the 10 months following the Dobbs decision, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has provided more than 650,000 in direct assistance for travel-related costs, such as airfare, lodging, and childcare. But how many other people needed those services? Sams-Abiodun asked. An abortion rights supporter sits outside a New Orleans clinic June 24, 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled its 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. Its one of three Louisiana abortion clinics that will resume services after a state judge temporarily stopped a state abortion ban from taking effect. Piper HutchinsonLouisiana Illuminator The national landscape Louisiana is now one of 13 states where nearly all abortions are banned. The state has one of the toughest bans in the country. Some states, such as Georgia and West Virginia, have enacted bans that include exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. Louisianas law only allows exceptions when a pregnant persons life or health may be at risk a standard that doctors have said is vague. The states list of conditions that warrant an exception, doctors have complained, fails to reflect the range of health presentations that a person with a nonviable pregnancy might have. An additional four states ban abortion at 15 weeks or earlier, with Georgia banning the procedure at six weeks. These new restrictions had an immediate impact on the number of abortions nationwide. According to a national report released on June 15, there were 25,640 fewer abortions after the Dobbs decision when compared to a pre-Dobbs period. Notably, the surge of abortions in less restrictive states did not account for the reduction in states where the procedure is banned. In Louisiana, there were an average of 785 abortions a month in the two months before Dobbs. From August 2022 through March 2023, the number of abortions in the state has dropped to near zero per month. People of color, low-income communities more vulnerable In the past year, New Orleans-based reproductive justice advocacy groups have been increasing their efforts to promote abortion rights, particularly for the most marginalized groups. Before Dobbs, we had already been doing this same work, especially Black women in the South had always been doing this same exact work, said Elyse Degree, reproductive justice engagement coordinator at Women with a Vision, a nonprofit with programs on reproductive justice, harm reduction, STD prevention, and sex worker advocacy. Now, the organization is striving to amp up visibility through outreach and programming, including their Survival Guide to a Post-Roe Louisiana and weekly library visits with pregnancy tests, emergency contraception, and sexual health resources. The Louisiana Abortion Fund, meanwhile, has spent the past year connecting more than 2,000 callers across 27 states and paying for the travel, clinic, and other associated fees for 1249 people. Their average round-trip to receive an abortion was 891 miles. More than 90 of their callers lived in Southern states where abortion is banned, and more than 75 of their callers were Black. The demographics of the Louisiana Abortion Fund callers reflect statewide and national trends when it comes to abortion, which disproportionately affects Black women and other women of color. I definitely dont want to downplay the significance of the Dobbs decision, but those intersecting difficulties have already been oppressing our people, have already been impacting peoples ability to make a choice for their reproductive health and reproductive futures, said Tyler Barbarin, director of grants and development at the Louisiana Abortion Fund. Last summer, Baton Rouge resident Nancy Davis garnered national attention when she was denied an abortion in Louisiana after learning that the fetus she was carrying had acrania, a fatal condition in which the fetus develops without a skull. Planned Parenthood and a New York abortion fund ultimately covered her procedure and expenses outside support that Davis said she needed. Thank God for a strong support system, because if it wasnt for that, I would not have been able to do it, she said. We have three kids that we have to care for and look after, so you know we didnt have those resources. That was one of the reasons I came out for help. In a sense, it was a cry for help. Acrania was added to the list of medical exceptions to the Louisiana abortion ban earlier this year, but doctors continue to complain that the law creates confusion when treating pregnancy complications and miscarriages. Providing an abortion that does not adhere to the bans specific exceptions holds penalties of up to 20 years in jail and fines of 200,000. Advocates push for legislation Lift Louisiana, an advocacy organization that promotes state policy change, pushed for a bill that the groups executive director Michelle Erenberg said would have made a modest change to the language in the law and addressed doctors confusion over when they can perform a procedure technically considered an abortion. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mary DuBuisson, R-Slidell, was rejected by the state House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee in May. Prior to the Dobbs decision, legislative staff sent abortion-related bills to the House Health and Welfare Committee. But since the overturning of Roe and the outlawing of abortions, these bills have gone to the criminal justice committee, due to abortions being outlawed. This committee is composed of some of the states most conservative representatives. We werent able to get a fair hearing on that legislation. It was all sent to a committee that really has no expertise in these medical issues, Erenberg said. Still, she said that Lift Louisiana is not going to stop their legal fight. The organization plans to bring back the bill in the next legislative session, as well as another recently defeated bill that sought to make exceptions to the abortion ban for cases of rape and incest. In addition to pushing legislation, Erenberg noted that theyre also monitoring trends in other states, adding that if Louisiana isnt the first one, its usually close to follow some of these bad, bad ideas. The recently defeated bills do not seem to align with public opinion on abortion. According to a recent LSU survey, 77 of Louisiana residents believe that abortion should be legal for victims of rape. The Pew Research Center found a rise in support for abortion access in states where bans have taken effect. People may consider themselves pro-life but they do strongly support having more exceptions to the law, Erenberg said. Despite the ongoing efforts of local reproductive justice organizations, Erenberg said that the onslaught of work is not sustainable. Sams-Abiodun echoed that sentiment while stressing the importance of a network of these groups. The services are complementary because the need is so great, she said. One organization cant do this alone. We need the Louisiana Abortion Fund, we need what Lift is doing, we need what Planned Parenthood is doing. And even with that, its still very difficult to get done. For Barbarin, now is the time to increase these advocacy efforts. Were trying to break down systems and address root causes, but also just love on our people, she said. In many ways, this work is committing to not abandoning the South. This is the moment that you need to double down on your commitment and your care for the South, she said. We invite people to continue to do this with us, like even past the one-year mark, even past the five-year mark, well still be here.

Wade in 2022, abortion rights advocacy groups in Louisiana are continuing their fight against restrictive abortion laws. Louisiana, one of the states with the strictest abortion bans, has seen a sharp decline in abortion access. Before the ruling, Louisiana had already limited abortion options, with only three clinics operating in the state. Following the Dobbs decision, the state’s trigger law banned nearly all abortions, and the number of abortions has dropped to near zero.

Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which has never provided abortions in Louisiana, shifted its focus to help patients access abortion care out of state. Through collaborations with national offices and local organizations, it has provided travel assistance for over 1,500 people from Louisiana and Texas, spending over $650,000 on travel-related costs. Despite these efforts, the state’s abortion law remains one of the most restrictive in the country, with few exceptions, creating confusion for medical professionals.

Local organizations, including Women with a Vision and the Louisiana Abortion Fund, are working to provide resources and support to marginalized communities, particularly people of color and those with low incomes. These groups have helped hundreds of individuals cover travel and clinic expenses, but the demand far outstrips their capacity. Advocacy efforts continue to push for legislative change, although efforts have faced setbacks, such as the failure of bills that sought to clarify medical exceptions or expand access in cases of rape or incest.

The ongoing challenges reflect broader issues of systemic inequality, with Black women disproportionately impacted by the abortion ban. Advocacy leaders emphasize the need for continued, coordinated efforts to support those most affected and to fight for future legislative changes, despite the toll it takes on resources and manpower. The battle for abortion rights in Louisiana is seen as part of a larger commitment to support reproductive justice in the South.","['Roe v', 'Wade', 'Louisiana', 'Illum', '##inator', 'Justice', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Josie Abugov', 'City Hall', 'New Orleans', 'U', 'S', 'Supreme Courts', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Louisiana', 'Piper HutchinsonLouisiana Illum', '##inator', 'ORLE', 'Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast', 'Louisiana', 'New Orleans', 'Baton Rouge', 'Planned Parenthood', 'South Claiborne Avenue', 'Magazine Street', 'Archdiocese of New', 'Orleans', 'Planned Parenthood', 'New Orleans', 'Planned Parenthood', 'John Bel Edwards', 'Democrat', 'Plan', 'Sam', 'Plan', '##hood', 'Gulf', 'Coast', 'U', 'S', 'Supreme Court', 'Dobbs', 'Health', 'Wade', 'Louisiana']","The article discusses the ongoing fight for abortion rights in Louisiana, one year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. The ruling allowed Louisiana’s trigger law to take effect, banning most abortions in the state. Prior to the Dobbs decision, Louisiana had already severely restricted abortion access, with only three clinics operating in the state. Now, with the law banning nearly all abortions, no clinics currently provide the service in Louisiana.

Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which had long been involved in reproductive health advocacy, faces obstacles in Louisiana. While the organization had attempted to build a clinic in New Orleans capable of performing abortions, the project faced protests, particularly from anti-abortion groups and the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Despite opening a new clinic in 2016, the organization was never granted the necessary license under Governor John Bel Edwards, an anti-abortion Democrat.

The Dobbs decision amplified the already limited abortion access in Louisiana, where restrictions had been in place for decades. Abortion rights groups like Planned Parenthood and the Louisiana Coalition for Reproductive Freedom, which includes 30 partners, have focused on helping individuals travel to states where abortion remains legal. In the first 10 months following Dobbs, the group assisted over 1,500 people from Louisiana and Texas, providing travel, lodging, and childcare support.

Louisiana’s abortion law only permits exceptions when a person’s life or health is at risk, but doctors argue that the law’s vague language leaves them uncertain about when to perform life-saving procedures. The law imposes severe penalties for violating these restrictions, including up to 20 years in prison and fines.

Advocacy groups are pushing for legislative change, such as a bill introduced by Lift Louisiana to clarify the law’s provisions, but this was blocked by the state’s conservative House committee. Despite this setback, organizations remain determined to continue their fight for reproductive rights, stressing the need for cooperation across various groups. As Louisiana’s laws become stricter, activists stress the importance of sustained efforts and support for the most vulnerable populations, particularly Black women, who are disproportionately affected by the ban.

In addition to Planned Parenthood, other groups like Women with a Vision and the Louisiana Abortion Fund are increasing their outreach efforts. These organizations help marginalized groups access reproductive care, with the Louisiana Abortion Fund assisting over 2,000 callers across 27 states and helping people travel an average of 891 miles to obtain an abortion. Reproductive justice activists also emphasize the need to address the root causes of reproductive oppression, aiming to provide support in the face of increasing legal and financial barriers.",L,
Louisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban ‚Ä¢ Louisiana Illuminator,"Louisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban Louisiana Illuminator HOME NEWS Election 2024 Govt Politics Environment Health Criminal Justice Education Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 1743 News Story HealthHealth CareHealth PolicyLegislative Louisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban A pregnancy could be terminated if fetus is missing a skull, under proposed health rule By Julie O'Donoghue - October 19, 2022 543 pm Photo by Astrid RieckenGetty Images Louisiana has proposed adding one new condition to the list of medical diagnoses that permit a person to have an abortion under the states strict abortion ban. It comes after a woman complained publicly that she couldnt terminate her compromised pregnancy. The state Department of Health quietly suggested an update to state abortion regulations in September that would put acrania a disorder where a fetus develops without a complete skull in the group of medically futile pregnancy conditions that can justify an abortion under state law. The change was proposed about a month after Nancy Davis told reporters she had been denied an abortion at Womans Hospital in Baton Rouge for a fetus diagnosed with acrania. The condition results in miscarriage, stillbirth or a very short lifespan for an infant born after the prognosis. Davis said Womans Hospital in Baton Rouge told her it could not end her pregnancy because of Louisianas abortion ban that went into effect last summer. She ended up traveling to New York in early September to undergo the procedure. Womans Hospital has not responded to a request for comment for this story. Slow process to add exceptions Adding acrania to the states medically futile pregnancy conditions list would change that dynamic moving forward. Once it is on the list, a person with a pregnancy affected by acrania should be able to get to an abortion, and a hospital could provide one without question. Still, the process for putting acrania on that list is slow-going. The health department has opted to update the states abortion regulations through a process that takes at least four months and often as long as six or seven months. Officials decided not to use an emergency process that would add acrania to the list immediately. I am very pleased they are adding acrania to the medically futile conditions list, but it should be added as an emergency item immediately, Davis said in an interview. There are women who are in underserved communities who need access to medical care and they need access now. The health department, which is in charge of drafting and amending abortion regulations, has not answered questions about why it wants to add acrania to the pregnancy conditions list. Health Secretary Courtney Phillips declined in person last month to respond to a reporters question about whether state abortion regulations would be updated. Instead, she referred the reporter to her agencys communications department. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX Confusion in state law There is confusion about whether acrania diagnoses could currently justify an abortion under a catch-all exception included in Louisianas abortion regulations. After Davis case garnered media attention, state Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, and several other anti-abortion legislators released a written statement saying Womans Hospital grossly misinterpreted Louisianas abortion policies. Jackson helped write the states strict abortion ban, including the statute that provides for exceptions for medically futile pregnancies. Abortions are allowed if a fetus has a profound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly that is inconsistent with sustaining life after birth, according to a state regulation. The lawmakers said this provision should have applied to Davis case. The law in conjunction with the emergency rule is very clear that this young lady is within the exception, lawmakers said in their statement. Jackson said health officials told her in August that an acrania diagnosis would justify an abortion. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel sent a general statement Monday that suggested that might be the case, but stopped short of confirming what Jackson said. This is an evolving document and LDH has always said that the list would not be able to encompass every possible diagnosis that would meet the definition of medically futile, Neel wrote. That is why the current regulation does and the final regulation will provide for physician certification of other conditions that would allow for termination. LDHs final rule will include acrania. Emergency option The confusion over acranias status may be cleared up if health officials added it to the medically futile condition list immediately. Regulations can be adopted or amended on an emergency basis under state law if they prevent an imminent peril to the public health, safety or welfare. The current list that doesnt include acrania was established under an emergency rule in August. The health department hasnt answered questions about why it isnt using that process to update the list. State officials routinely approve or amend emergency regulations. Recent emergency rules include those that closed the red snapper fishing and oyster harvesting seasons as well as adjustments to the minimum qualifications for a licensed teacher. In August and September alone, there were 10 new state emergency rules adopted, including one to establish weight classes for London Ring Fighting, described as the sport of boxing conducted without the use of boxing gloves or other padding on the participants hands. In recent years, legislators have complained that state officials, particularly those in the health department, use the emergency regulation process too often. It allows state agencies to initially bypass the public hearing and comment period required before a regulation can be permanently adopted, which makes some lawmakers uneasy. Acrania is unlikely to be the only new condition proposed for the medically futile list. Doctors have already said other illnesses will come up regularly that might justify the termination of a pregnancy. The health department will never be able to think of everything because medicine doesnt work like that, said Dr. Rebekah Gee, an obstetriciangynecologist based in New Orleans and the former head of the Louisiana Department of Health. You will never be able to come up with a complete list. Anti-abortion advocates could also push back on adding more conditions. The states leading anti-abortion organizations didnt want the state to allow as many exceptions to the abortion ban in the first place. They unsuccessfully fought to take the language that created the medically futile pregnancy conditions list out of the law before it was approved last spring. We were not excited about this list, said Gene Mills, head of Louisiana Family Forum, a conservative Christian organization. I think it creates as an illustrative list does winners and losers, and there are always unintended consequences in doing that. Some anti-abortion advocates said conditions expected to be fatal to an infant, including acrania, do not justify abortion because they believe it amounts to ending a life prematurely. We know that it is a heartbreaking situation, and we know people who have been through similar circumstances who have chosen to carry the baby to term. Sometimes the child can live much longer than the medical diagnosis predicts, said Benjamin Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, the states leading antiabortion organization. We are certainly not making light of this in any way, Clapper said. Its a heroic thing to love that child until the end. SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

This proposed change came after a woman, Nancy Davis, publicly shared her experience of being denied an abortion for a pregnancy diagnosed with acrania, despite the condition typically resulting in stillbirth or a very short lifespan for the infant. Davis ultimately sought an abortion in New York.

Currently, abortions in Louisiana are allowed under certain exceptions, such as when a fetus has severe, life-threatening conditions. However, there has been confusion over whether acrania qualifies under the existing law. Some lawmakers, including State Senator Katrina Jackson, have argued that acrania should have been covered under the medically futile pregnancy exception, as the condition is incompatible with sustaining life.

Despite this, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) is slowly moving through the process of adding acrania to the official list of medically futile conditions, a process that could take several months. This update, while a step forward, has been met with calls for a faster response, with some advocates urging for an emergency rule to address the issue more quickly.

Opponents of broader abortion exceptions, including anti-abortion groups, argue that conditions like acrania should not justify abortion, as they believe in preserving life as long as possible, regardless of medical prognosis. These groups also opposed the initial creation of the medically futile pregnancy conditions list.

The situation underscores ongoing debates in Louisiana over the limits of abortion exceptions, with further discussions expected as other medical conditions might be proposed for inclusion.","['Louisiana', 'Louisiana', 'Justice', 'Care', 'Louisiana', ""Julie O ' Donoghue"", 'Astrid Riecken', '##G', 'Louisiana', 'Department of Health', 'Nancy Davis', 'Womans Hospital', 'Baton Rouge', 'Davis', 'Womans Hospital', 'Baton Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'New York', 'Womans Hospital', 'Davis']","Louisiana is considering expanding the list of medical exceptions to its strict abortion ban, with a proposal to include acrania—a condition where a fetus develops without a skull—as a medically futile pregnancy condition.

The state Department of Health (LDH) suggested adding acrania to the list of conditions that justify abortion under the state’s laws, but the process of officially updating the regulations is slow and could take several months. This delay has sparked frustration, with Davis and others advocating for an emergency update to expedite the process. State officials have not provided clear answers on why acrania was not added immediately.

There is also confusion surrounding whether acrania is already covered under the state’s existing “catch-all” exception for medically futile pregnancies. Some lawmakers, including state Sen. Katrina Jackson, argue that the law already allows for abortion in such cases, but health officials have not confirmed this interpretation.

While the health department plans to eventually include acrania in the official regulations, it is uncertain if other conditions will be added in the future, as medical diagnoses evolve. Anti-abortion groups have expressed concern about the potential expansion of exceptions, arguing that conditions like acrania do not justify abortion, as they believe in the sanctity of life, even when a child may have a very short life expectancy.

The debate is ongoing, with medical professionals acknowledging that a comprehensive list of conditions cannot be easily created, given the complexity of medical diagnoses. The situation highlights the tensions between Louisiana’s abortion laws, public health concerns, and the rights of women seeking abortion under extreme circumstances.",L,

On June 1, 2020, the Health Ministry published a technical note highlighting the difficulties women and girls may encounter in getting sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic and suggested measures to improve access. Two days later, President Jair Bolsonaro distorted the notes content in a tweet, saying that the ministry was trying to identify its authors and did not support any proposal to legalize abortion. The ministry then removed two of the three public servants who signed the note from leadership positions. The Brazilian health system is under strain because of Covid-19, but women and girls who need abortions cant wait until the end of the pandemic, said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, Americas acting deputy director at Human Rights Watch. Instead of ensuring that women and girls have access to essential health care and support during this crisis, President Bolsonaro ignored expert guidelines, lied about a Health Ministry document that recommended improving services, and punished the officials who signed it. As of June 11, Brazil had 800,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and about 41,000 deaths.Several news reports in Brazil have suggested that some local authorities have suspended sexual and reproductive services considered not urgent, including providing contraception, during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, only 42 hospitals, in a country of about 210 million people, are currently performing legal abortions, according to a study conducted by the nonprofit Article 19 and news sites AzMina and Gnero e Nmero. In 2019, it was 76 hospitals. On June 1, three offices within the Health Ministry, including the Office of Coordination of Womens Health, jointly published Technical Note 162020, with support from the Pan American Health Organization PAHO, which serves as Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization WHO. The note was posted on a Health Ministry website. The five-page note underscored the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on access to health services for vulnerable populations, particularly poor women and girls. It warned that women and girls may not have access to contraceptives and also may suffer increased gender-based violence during the pandemic, leading to unwanted pregnancies. It said that the authorities should make all possible efforts to maintain sexual and reproductive health services to prevent causing important and irreparable harm to womens comprehensive health. Among those essential services it listed services for victims of sexual violence access to contraception, particularly emergency contraception prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and access to safe abortion in the cases contemplated by Brazilian law. Abortion is legal in Brazil in cases of rape, when necessary to save a womans life, or when the fetus has anencephaly, a fatal congenital brain disorder. Human Rights Watch has urged Brazilian authorities to decriminalize abortion and ensure access to safe abortion and post-abortion care, in line with its obligations under international human rights law. On June 4, the Health Ministry acknowledged in a statement that its Office of Coordination of Womens Health had written the note. But it claimed that the note was not discussed within the Ministry of Health and said that the ministry had initiated disciplinary proceedings to identify those responsible for writing and publishing it. The next day, the acting health minister removed two of the people who signed the note from their positions as coordinators for womens health and for life cycles, respectively. Both are public servants, who can only be fired if they commit a crime or a serious infraction. They continue to work for the ministry in lower-level positions.In a joint letter released on June 6, 98 civil society organizations, including Human Rights Watch, rejected the governments distortion of the notes content and expressed their solidarity with the two public servants who suffered reprisals and all other employees of the Health Ministry who are trying to ensure high quality public health.The WHO has warned that reductions in the availability of essential sexual and reproductive health care, including maternal and newborn health services, around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic will result in many thousands of maternal and newborn deaths due to millions of additional unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and complicated deliveries without access to essential and emergency care. The WHO has recommended that governments prioritize ensuring access to contraception, abortion to the full extent allowed by law, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, many pregnant women and girls in Brazil had to choose between continuing dangerous or unwanted pregnancies or seeking unsafe methods to end them. A case challenging the criminalization of abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is pending before the Supreme Court. In a different case, in April, the court rejected on a technicality a petition to allow pregnant women infected with the Zika virus, which can cause microcephaly and other harm when a fetus is exposed in utero, to choose whether to continue their pregnancy. In both cases, Human Rights Watch submitted amicus briefs arguing that Brazils abortion laws are incompatible with its human rights obligations under international law.

On June 1, 2020, Brazil’s Ministry of Health issued a technical note acknowledging the challenges women and girls face in accessing sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic. The note emphasized the importance of maintaining services like contraception, safe abortion, and care for victims of sexual violence.

However, after the Ministry of Health released the note, President Jair Bolsonaro distorted its message and downplayed its support for abortion services, claiming the note sought to legalize abortion. This led to the removal of two public servants who had signed the document from their leadership positions. This action drew criticism from civil society groups, including Human Rights Watch, who condemned the distortion of the note’s content and the retaliation against the officials.

The pandemic exacerbated existing issues, such as a decline in the availability of sexual and reproductive health services. Only 42 hospitals in Brazil were performing legal abortions, down from 76 in 2019. Moreover, with the pandemic’s strain on healthcare, vulnerable groups like low-income women and girls were increasingly unable to access essential services, potentially leading to unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.

Human Rights Watch has been advocating for Brazil to decriminalize abortion and ensure safe access to abortion care in line with international human rights law. They have also submitted briefs in cases challenging Brazil’s restrictive abortion laws in the Supreme Court.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of global consequences due to the reduction of essential healthcare during the pandemic, which could result in increased maternal deaths and unsafe abortions. Human Rights Watch continues to call for the prioritization of sexual and reproductive health services during this crisis.","['Brazil', 'Rights', 'Pande', 'Human Rights Watch', 'Human Rights Watch', 'English', 'Franais De', '##uts', 'Port', '##ug', '##us Espaol', 'Brazil', 'Rights', 'Pande', '##sA', 'LinkedI', 'Red', 'Ro de Janeiro', 'Brasil', 'Paulo Brazil', 'Covid - 19', 'Human Rights Watch', 'Health Ministry', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'Brazilian', 'Tamara', 'Americas', 'Watch']","In June 2020, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on Brazil to ensure uninterrupted access to sexual and reproductive health services, including abortion, during the COVID-19 pandemic. HRW emphasized that these services are essential for women’s health and must continue despite the healthcare system’s strain due to the pandemic. Brazil’s Health Ministry issued a technical note on June 1, 2020, recognizing the challenges women and girls face in accessing these services, such as contraceptives and abortion, and suggested measures to improve access. However, President Jair Bolsonaro misrepresented the note’s content in a tweet, accusing it of supporting abortion legalization, which led to the removal of two officials involved in drafting the document.

Brazil’s health system was already under pressure from COVID-19, with over 800,000 confirmed cases and around 41,000 deaths by June 2020. Reports indicated that local authorities had suspended some non-urgent reproductive health services, including contraception and legal abortions, further exacerbating the challenges for women and girls. A study showed that only 42 hospitals in Brazil, out of its population of 210 million, were performing legal abortions, a decrease from 76 in 2019.

The technical note, which was supported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO, listed essential services such as emergency contraception, sexual violence care, and access to safe abortion in cases allowed by Brazilian law. Abortion in Brazil is legal only in cases of rape, when the woman’s life is at risk, or when the fetus has anencephaly. HRW has long urged Brazil to decriminalize abortion and ensure safe abortion access, in line with international human rights standards.

In response to the government’s actions, 98 civil society organizations, including HRW, expressed their solidarity with the dismissed officials and rejected the government’s distortion of the note. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic’s impact on reproductive health services could lead to thousands of additional maternal and newborn deaths due to unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and lack of emergency care.

HRW has also submitted amicus briefs in Brazil’s Supreme Court, challenging the criminalization of abortion in the first trimester and advocating for broader reproductive rights protections.",L,

Abortion rights supporters chant during rally in Tucson, Arizona, on July 4, 2022. Sandy HuffakerAFPGetty Images CNN An Arizona Superior Court judge ruled Friday that a 1901 ban on nearly all abortions in that state can be enforced, a decision that is likely to see an appeal and is all but certain to galvanize female voters to turn out in greater numbers in the states closely contested US Senate and governors races. In ruling that Arizonas near-total ban on abortion could take effect, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson granted a request by the states Republican attorney general to lift a court injunction that had barred enforcement of Arizonas pre-statehood ban on abortion after the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973. The court finds that because the legal basis for the judgment entered in 1973 has now been overruled, it must vacate the judgment in its entirety, Johnson wrote in the ruling released Friday. The case has thrust the issue of how restrictive abortion law should be in Arizona, a swing state that President Joe Biden carried by fewer than 11,000 votes. Its a controversial topic that has divided Republicans in Arizona and is reflective of a pitched debate nationwide in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in late June, with many GOP-led states passing increasingly restrictive measures that run the risk of alienating moderate voters. The judges ruling effectively outlaws all abortions in Arizona except when the procedure is necessary to save the mothers life. The decision came a day before a 15-week ban on abortion was slated to go into effect in Arizona. That law was passed by Arizona lawmakers before the US Supreme Court decision. Indiana Senator Susan Glick, author of Senate Bill 1, debates Senator Greg Taylor shortly before the vote to accept Senate Bill 1, which was passed by the House earlier in the day, making the Indiana legislature the first in the nation to restrict abortions, in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. August 5, 2022. REUTERSCheney Orr Cheney OrrReuters Related article Abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states. Here's where things stand Conservative Arizona lawmakers included language in the bill banning abortion after 15 weeks stating that the new legislation would not override the 1901 law which was passed before Arizona became a state and can be traced back to as early as 1864. In addition to barring abortion in all cases except when it is necessary to save the mothers life, the pre-statehood law carries a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers. While fighting the attorney generals move to allow the 1901 abortion ban to be enforced, abortion rights groups had argued that if both laws were to go into effect, it would create significant confusion for both abortion providers and women seeking care. But the judge said in her ruling that she was not weighing in on how the conflict between Arizonas abortion laws would be settled. While there may be legal questions the parties seek to resolve regarding Arizona statutes on abortion, those questions are not for this Court to decide here, Johnson wrote in the decision. The ruling drew a swift rebuke from several Democratic groups that favor abortion rights and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Katie Hobbs, who said she was outraged and devastated by the decision. Theres no doubt in my mind that this draconian 1901 law will have dire consequences on the health and well-being of Arizona women and their families, Hobbs said in a statement. This cruel law effectively outlaws abortion in Arizona with no exceptions for rape or incest and risks womens fundamental freedom to make their own health care decisions. To make matters worse, this law mandates jail time for abortion providers. Medical professionals will now be forced to think twice and call their lawyer before providing patients with oftentimes necessary, lifesaving care. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre criticized the Arizona court ruling as catastrophic, dangerous and unacceptable. Make no mistake this backwards decision exemplifies the disturbing trend across the country of Republican officials at the local and national level dead-set on stripping women of their rights, including through South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Grahams proposed national abortion ban, she said in a statement. Arizona GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who led the legal process to try to get the states pre-statehood ban on abortion put back into effect after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in late June, tweeted that he was pleased by the decision We applaud the court for upholding the will of the legislature and providing clarity and uniformity on this important issue. I have and will continue to protect the most vulnerable Arizonans, he tweeted. The disagreement over Arizonas abortion laws has created a confusing legal landscape in Arizona for much of the summer that has unfolded against the backdrop of a shifting national political mood ahead of Novembers midterm elections. While both historical trends and the nations sour mood about inflation had initially appeared to favor Republicans in their quest to take control of the US House and Senate this November, the Supreme Courts decision on abortion has energized female voters all over the country a dynamic that led to the surprising victory for proponents of abortion rights in Kansas and better-than-expected performances for Democrats in special elections for the US House since the Dobbs ruling. The ruling injects a new uncertainty into the marquee statewide races. Republicans, who need a net gain of just one seat to flip the Senate, are trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly as he runs for a full six-year term. And Democrats are trying to flip the governors mansion, currently held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. In the Arizona governors race, Hobbs has portrayed GOP opponent Kari Lake as extreme on abortion. Lake has repeatedly said she is opposed to the procedure and in an August news conference said that she would uphold the laws that are on the books. But she did not specify which laws she meant. If people dont like the laws on the books, then they need to elect representatives who will change the laws. Im running for governor, not for God. So I dont get to write the laws, she said. Her campaign has not responded to CNNs requests for clarification on her view of the pre-statehood law. Both Lake and GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters, who is challenging Kelly, have argued that their Democratic opponents have adopted positions that are too far out of the mainstream in favor of abortion rights. Masters removed language from his campaign website expressing support for a federal personhood law and other conservative anti-abortion stances after winning the GOP nomination last month. His campaign told CNN that Masters does support Grahams proposal for a federal ban on abortion at 15 weeks, which would provide exceptions to protect the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest. But before the ruling, Masters campaign did not respond to questions about his position on the pre-statehood law or the court case to enforce it. In a statement Friday, Kelly said the decision would have a devastating impact on the freedom Arizona women have had for decades to choose an abortion if they need one. Lets be clear, this is exactly what Blake Masters wants, to completely ban abortions in Arizona and across the country without even an exception for rape or incest. I will never stop fighting to restore these rights for Arizona women. Planned Parenthood Federation of America fought Brnovichs move in Pima County Superior Court the court that handled the 1973 injunction. The groups lawyers had argued that the court had a duty to harmonize all of the Arizona Legislatures enactments as they exist today. In the post-Dobbs era, the group argued that the pre-statehood law could be enforceable in some respects but that it should not apply to abortions provided by licensed physicians and instead that the ban should apply to anyone other than a licensed physician who attempts to provide abortion services. In a statement, Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona, said Fridays ruling has the practical and deplorable result of sending Arizonans back nearly 150 years. No archaic law should dictate our reproductive freedom and how we live our lives today. This story has been updated with a statement from the White House on Saturday.

This decision came after the Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected abortion rights nationwide. The ruling effectively nullifies a 1973 injunction that had blocked the 1901 law, and it applies even as a separate 15-week abortion ban was set to take effect.

The ruling is part of a broader debate over abortion laws in Arizona, a key swing state, which has seen a shift in political dynamics since the Roe v. Wade decision. The judge’s decision was met with swift backlash from abortion rights supporters, including Democratic candidates like Katie Hobbs, who criticized the law for its harsh consequences on women’s health and freedoms. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also condemned the ruling as “catastrophic” and part of a larger, troubling trend across Republican-led states.

Arizona’s Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who had pushed to reinstate the 1901 law, expressed approval of the ruling, claiming it upholds the will of the state legislature. However, the ruling has raised confusion over the legal landscape for abortion in Arizona, especially as the state approaches critical midterm elections. Abortion rights groups, such as Planned Parenthood, plan to continue challenging the decision.

The decision has become a significant point of contention in Arizona’s gubernatorial and Senate races, with both Democratic and Republican candidates framing the issue as central to the upcoming elections. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly and gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs have voiced strong opposition to the decision, while Republican candidates like Kari Lake and Blake Masters have downplayed their positions on the pre-statehood law. The ruling, which is expected to energize voters, particularly women, will likely play a significant role in the state’s elections.","['Arizona', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'Congress', 'CNN', 'CNN', 'US International Arabic', 'CNN', 'World Africa', 'Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom', 'US', 'Bell', 'US', 'Olympics', 'Hockey Digital Studios CNN', 'CNN', 'Earth', 'World', 'Africa', 'CNN', 'CNN Leadership CNN', 'CNN', 'Arizona', 'Maeve Reston', 'CNN', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'CNN', 'Arizona', 'US', 'Senate', 'Arizona']","An Arizona judge ruled that the state can enforce a near-total abortion ban, effectively outlawing all abortions except when necessary to save the mother’s life.

The ruling follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, allowing states more authority to regulate abortion.

The Arizona law has been a point of contention, with Democrats criticizing the decision as harmful to women’s rights and public health, as it does not allow exceptions for cases of rape or incest and imposes prison sentences for abortion providers. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the ruling, calling it dangerous and an infringement on women’s rights. Arizona’s Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who advocated for the law’s enforcement, supported the decision, asserting it upheld the legislature’s will.

This ruling is expected to impact key upcoming elections, including the Senate and gubernatorial races in Arizona, where abortion rights are a central issue. The legal uncertainty in Arizona, combined with national trends following the Dobbs decision, could energize female voters, especially in swing states like Arizona, where President Biden won narrowly in 2020. Governor Doug Ducey’s seat is contested, with Hobbs challenging Republican Kari Lake, who supports abortion restrictions but has not clarified her stance on the 1901 law.

In response, Planned Parenthood Arizona vowed to continue fighting the law, arguing it harkens back to outdated practices and restricts reproductive freedom. The legal battle is set to continue as both sides prepare for further appeals.",L,

To do so would betray the very purpose of the institution. The university says its tweets saying an investigation was underway were inartfully worded. FIRE thanks UK for the timely response. Student to demonstrator Sorry! First Amendment, man. FIRE in letter to UK Yeah. What she said. The viral video spans just 22 seconds. But the stain on the University of Kentuckys reputation for threatening a lawful student protest on its public campus may last far longer. FIRE wrote to UK this afternoon urging it to immediately reverse course after it tweeted yesterday that it will investigate a group of four students who displayed mocking behavior toward a pro-life demonstrator. Or as we here at FIRE like to call it Fully protected, core political speech. In the video which was apparently taken last fall but went viral just yesterday the students are seen standing in front of a pro-life demonstrators sign which depicts an aborted fetus doing a roughly choreographed dance, and then grabbing their bags to leave. One of the women turns to the man and says, Sorry. No uterus, no opinion. She momentarily extends her middle finger and walks away, before turning back a final time to add Actually, I promise Id kill my baby if I got pregnant. One of the other students chimes in I literally would! Are you kidding me? No uterus, no opinion. At one point, another student shouts in feigned remorse to the demonstrator Sorry. First Amendment, man. Thats the essence of FIREs letter to UK, reminding the public, land-grant institution that not only does the First Amendment protect this kind of basic, political counter-protest, but so does Kentucky state law, which mandates that UK maintain policies that uphold the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, learn, and discuss any issue, and a marketplace of ideas where the free exchange of ideas is not suppressed because an idea put forth is considered by some or even most of the members of the institutions community to be offensive, unwise, disagreeable, conservative, liberal, traditional, or radical. The Kentucky law also bans unreasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of student speech that occurs in the outdoor areas of campus or is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. As we explain The students expressive conduct here is wholly protected by the First Amendment, does not constitute unlawful fighting words or harassment, and cannot be investigated or restricted on the basis that some may find it offensive. The First Amendment protects the display of the middle finger. Indeed, the display of the middle finger is so plainly protected by the First Amendment that officials who penalize such expressive activity have been held personally liable for violating clearly established constitutional rights. Citations omitted. Read more about the expressive qualities of middle fingers here. We also note that even mere investigations, without additional punishment, violate the First Amendment when an officials act would chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment activities. Even critics of the students expression have recognized it is plainly protected. Sorry. First Amendment, man. Mark Harrington, president of the pro-life group Created Equal, told local media today that it was his group that the students were confronting and that he flatly opposes UK investigating them. Free speech is a cornerstone of our republic, and we oppose universities investigating students for their free expression, Harrington told WTVQ. The university can play a role in teaching students to have respectful dialogue with those they disagree with. The universitys Twitter account responded to the video yesterday within roughly an hour, so we know theyre ready to spring into action when a policy violation occurs. Weve given the university until close-of-business tomorrow to confirm that it will publicly rescind its investigation threat and take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again.

The video, which emerged in early February 2022, shows four students confronting the demonstrator, mocking his pro-life message with remarks like “No uterus, no opinion” and other statements about abortion. One student also displayed a middle finger in the interaction.

In response, UK initially tweeted about investigating the incident, but quickly clarified that it was not pursuing an investigation, admitting that the wording was unclear. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) issued a letter urging UK to reverse its stance, emphasizing that the students’ actions were protected by the First Amendment and Kentucky state law, both of which guarantee free speech on public university campuses.

FIRE pointed out that even expressions such as the middle finger are constitutionally protected. Penalizing or investigating students for this kind of speech could chill future expression, violating their First Amendment rights. FIRE’s letter also highlighted that UK’s own policies, along with state law, require the university to uphold broad free speech protections and prevent unreasonable restrictions on student expression.

The pro-life demonstrator involved in the incident, Mark Harrington, also opposed any investigation, stating that the university should focus on fostering respectful dialogue, not suppressing free expression. FIRE called on UK to publicly retract its investigation threat and ensure that such actions would not occur again, urging the university to prioritize its commitment to free speech.","['University of Kentucky', 'Assembly', 'Student Network', 'Network', '##E Legal Network', 'FIRE Legal Network', 'FIR', 'Network', 'F']","The University of Kentucky (UK) faced criticism after threatening to investigate students who mocked a pro-life demonstrator in a viral video.

UK later clarified that it would not pursue an investigation, calling its previous statement a miscommunication.

May 18 AP Video by Nick Ingram AP produced by Javier Arciga Photos 5 By Margery A. Beck and Josh Funk Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print LINCOLN, Neb. AP Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a bill Monday that bans abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy and restricts gender-affirming medical care for people younger than 19.The abortion ban takes effect immediately, while the ban on gender-affirming care takes effect on Oct. 1. The hybrid measure ties together restrictions that Republicans have pursued across the U.S.Pillen called the law the most significant win for social conservative agenda in over a generation of Nebraska before he signed the law while holding the 5-day-old daughter of some friends as his two oldest granddaughters stood next to him.Its about protecting our kids and saving babies. Pure and simple, Pillen said. Opponents have promised to sue to try and block the law. The head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, Mindy Rush Chipman, said in a statement that every option is on the table to undo these regressive measures. The governors decision to sign these sweeping restrictions into law betrays a total disregard for Nebraskans freedom, health and well-being, Rush Chipman said. Just as we have seen in other states, these bans will result in significant harm, most intensely hurting already vulnerable communities. READ MORE A new kind of hospital is coming to rural America. To qualify, facilities must close their beds Nebraska governor blames university leadership for AD Trev Alberts sudden departure for Texas AM Trev Alberts is leaving Nebraska to become Texas AMs athletic director Nebraska had not passed a new abortion ban since 2010, when it became the first state to limit the procedure at around 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 12-week ban includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who pursued even tougher abortion restrictions during the session, wiped away tears as she said she hopes to eventually enact a ban at all stages of pregnancy.Planned Parenthood, which operates two of Nebraskas three abortion clinics, said the new law increases the burden on women who need abortions, forcing more of them to travel out of state. Its heartbreaking that we have to tell patients that they cannot receive their health care here in Nebraska anymore, said Andi Curry Grubb, Nebraska executive director for Planned Parenthood North Central States.The law forced Planned Parenthood to reschedule three patients this week, and Curry Grubb said that within her five-state region, there has been a 40 increase in second-trimester abortions since Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer. More women are being forced to push abortions later into pregnancy because of hurdles involved with seeking care out of state. She said its troubling that the new law doesnt include any exception for fetal anomalies, which may not be diagnosed until after the 12th week of pregnancy.North Carolina also recently passed a 12-week abortion ban, among a slew of restrictions enacted in states after the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. Fourteen states have approved an abortion ban throughout pregnancy.Nebraskas law also will prevent transgender people under 19 from receiving any gender-confirming surgery. It restricts the use of hormone treatments and puberty blockers in minors, putting the states chief medical officer a political appointee who is an ear, nose and throat doctor in charge of setting the rules for those therapies. In Nebraska, people younger than 19 are considered minors. The states unicameral Legislature passed the bill with the two contentious issues on Friday after hours of heated debate. Conservative lawmakers wrangled just enough votes to end a filibuster before approving the bill. The proposal restricting gender-affirming care was the flashpoint of an epic filibuster led by Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh. She and a handful of progressive allies slowed the business of passing laws to a crawl by introducing amendment after amendment to every bill that made it to the Senate floor. That sent leadership scrambling to prioritize which bills to push through. Omaha Sen. Kathleen Kauth, who introduced the proposal restricting gender-affirming care, said Monday that the filibuster actually gave senators more time to discuss and research the issue. The filibuster actually is what made this happen, Kauth said. And so I doubt it was their intention, but that gave us the time to make this work.Nebraska is now among at least 18 states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for minors. Proposals are pending before the governors of Texas and Missouri. Medical groups and advocates say such restrictions are further marginalizing transgender youth and threatening their health.One Nebraska lawmaker, Omaha state Sen. Megan Hunt, disclosed in March that her teenage son is transgender and said Friday that she now plans to leave the state.Pillen said he didnt want Nebraska families considering gender-affirming medical care to be duped into the silliness that if you do this, youre going to become happy. Funk contributed to this story from Omaha, Neb. Josh Funk Josh covers railroads Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway mailto","On May 20, 2024, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed a law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and imposes restrictions on gender-affirming medical care for minors. The law is a significant win for social conservatives and has been met with strong opposition. The abortion ban includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. Planned Parenthood expressed concerns that the law will force women to seek abortions out of state, especially for later-term procedures.

Additionally, the law prohibits transgender individuals under 19 from accessing gender-affirming surgeries and restricts hormone treatments and puberty blockers. The bill also empowers the state’s chief medical officer to regulate these treatments. This law, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, makes Nebraska one of 18 states that have enacted similar restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors.

The law was passed after a contentious debate in the state legislature, with a significant filibuster led by progressive senators. Supporters of the law, including Governor Pillen, argue that it is aimed at protecting children and preventing harmful medical practices. However, opponents, including the ACLU of Nebraska, warn that the measures will harm vulnerable communities and undermine individual freedoms.","['Nebraska', 'AP', 'World U', 'S', 'Election', 'Israel', 'Hamas War Russia', 'Ukraine War', 'Asia', 'Pacific', 'Latin', 'America', 'Europe Africa Middle East China', 'Australia Joe', 'B', '##iden Congress March Madness MLB NBA NHL NFL Soccer Golf Tennis AP', 'Associated Press', 'AP', 'AP', 'Associated Press', 'AP', 'AP', 'Associated Press', 'Israel', 'Hamas', 'Unilever', 'Haiti', 'Elon Musk', 'Nebraska', 'Nebraska Legislature', 'Nick Ingram', 'AP', 'Javier Arc', '##ger', 'Beck', 'S', 'Co', 'Em', 'Facebook X Red', '##I', 'Pi', '##COLN', 'N', 'AP', 'Republican', 'Nebraska', 'Go', 'Pi', '##ir', '##ir', 'Republicans']","On Monday, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed a law that introduces a 12-week abortion ban and limits gender-affirming medical care for minors. The abortion ban, effective immediately, includes exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, while the restrictions on gender-affirming care will take effect on October 1. The law, which has sparked significant controversy, ties together two major conservative goals in the U.S.—restricting abortion access and limiting transgender care for minors. Governor Pillen described the law as a significant victory for Nebraska’s social conservatives, emphasizing its focus on protecting children and unborn babies.

Opponents, including the ACLU of Nebraska, argue that the law disregards personal freedoms and health, and threaten legal action to block its enforcement. Planned Parenthood, which operates in Nebraska, criticized the law for increasing burdens on women, pushing many to seek abortions out of state. The law does not allow exceptions for cases of fetal anomalies, a point of contention among some health advocates.

Nebraska also joins at least 18 other states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for minors. These restrictions include bans on surgeries and hormone treatments for those under 19. The law was passed after a contentious legislative battle, including a filibuster led by Senator Machaela Cavanaugh, which delayed the process but allowed for further debate on the issues.

The debate over these measures reflects a broader national trend of conservative states pushing for tighter regulations on abortion and transgender rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.",R,

While many students at our school hold pro-life values considering their religion, its still important to provide opportunities to discuss pro-life apologetics so students can defend their beliefs. One of our groups most popular apologetics events is National Pro-Life Chalk Day, where we chalk pro-life art and sayings on the sidewalk in front of our school building. Heres how we switched things up this year and the reaction it received We wanted to hold something like a Cemetery of the Innocents display where crosses or flags are put out to memorialize preborn children lost to abortion to inform our student body of the widespread effects of abortion and to show them that, despite Roe v. Wade being reversed and the loss of the Value Them Both Amendment, abortion is a prevalent issue in our state and nation. Thats why for National Pro-Life Chalk Day this fall, our SFLA group, Heritage Students for Life, chalked 2,363 hearts on the sidewalk in front of our school to represent the 2,363 preborn children killed in the United States daily by abortion. We had thirteen students come out to help, and it took us thirty minutes to chalk all of the hearts. We also created posters sharing what the hearts represented and directed students to Live Actions website 2363.org. Our display caused quite a bit of discussion among our school community which is exactly what we had hoped for. We focused our conversations on the violence of abortion and the scale at which it occurs, especially in our community. Not many people who live in our city know that there are two abortion facilities nearby that perform abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy, or that the abortion industry in Kansas has been booming due to travelers from other states with more stringent abortion restrictions coming to Kansas. We challenged students to define their position on abortion, and we had four new students who were interested in joining us in our mission to make abortion inaccessible and unthinkable. They became members of our group, and we are excited to have them. At our school, we have lots of students who hold pro-life convictions, but many do not know how to put those beliefs into practice. Our display helped students get plugged into pro-life activism and supportive services, and the response that the student body had makes me hopeful for the pro-life movement in Kansas and throughout the nation.

The author discusses an event organized by the Heritage Students for Life group at Heritage Christian Academy in Kansas.

For National Pro-Life Chalk Day, the group chalked 2,363 hearts on the sidewalk to represent the daily number of preborn children lost to abortion in the U.S. They aimed to educate their peers about the ongoing prevalence of abortion, especially in Kansas, where the industry is expanding due to increased out-of-state demand. The event was designed to raise awareness about the violence of abortion and to provoke discussions among students, many of whom were unaware of the abortion facilities near their community.

The display not only spurred important conversations but also led to four new members joining the pro-life group. The event served as a valuable tool for helping students translate their pro-life beliefs into activism. The author expresses hope for the future of the pro-life movement, both within Kansas and nationally, underscoring the need for continued efforts to make abortion “inaccessible and unthinkable.”","['Christian', 'Pro', 'Life', 'Students for Life of America', 'SFLA', 'Christian', 'Pro', 'Life', '##line Wharton', 'SFLA', '##deus Stevens', 'Rebecca Rose', 'Students for Life of America SFLA', 'Heritage Christian Academy', 'Kansas', 'National Pro - Life Cha', 'Day', 'Cemetery of the Innocents', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Value Them Both Amendment', 'National', 'Day', 'SFLA', 'Heritage', 'Life', 'States']","The article “Why Christian Schools Still Need a Pro-Life Presence” by Rebecca Rose, a Thaddeus Stevens Fellow at Students for Life of America (SFLA), highlights the importance of maintaining a pro-life presence in Christian schools.

Despite this, she emphasizes the need for ongoing discussions and opportunities for students to defend these beliefs, particularly through pro-life apologetics.

A key event organized by the school’s SFLA group is National Pro-Life Chalk Day. This event involves students chalking messages and art about the pro-life cause on sidewalks. In one recent instance, the group chalked 2,363 hearts to represent the 2,363 preborn children killed daily by abortion in the U.S. This initiative spurred significant discussion among the student body, raising awareness about abortion’s widespread impact, including the presence of two abortion facilities in their city.

Rose notes that while many students at Heritage Christian Academy hold pro-life convictions, some are unsure how to translate those beliefs into action. The chalk event provided a platform for pro-life activism and led to four new students joining the school’s pro-life group, Heritage Students for Life. Rose expresses optimism for the future of the pro-life movement, both locally in Kansas and nationally, stating that their efforts fostered deeper engagement in pro-life activism among students.

This article underscores the ongoing need to engage students in pro-life discourse and activism, even in Christian environments where many already share pro-life values.",L,
Here‚Äôs where Minn. congressional candidates stand on national abortion ban ‚Ä¢ Minnesota Reformer,"Heres where Minn. congressional candidates stand on national abortion ban Minnesota Reformer HOME NEWS election 2024 Work Money Civil Rights Health Care Schools Housing Transportation Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 800 News Story Election 2022Government PoliticsHealth Care Heres where Minn. congressional candidates stand on national abortion ban By Maia Irvin - September 22, 2022 800 am The exterior of a Planned Parenthood Reproductive Health Services Center is seen on May 28, 2019 in St Louis, Missouri. Photo by Michael B. ThomasGetty Images. For decades, Republicans promised voters theyd ban abortions if only the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade. Sure enough, abortion was swiftly banned in Republican-controlled states around the country in the wake of the courts June decision striking down Roe. But a public backlash evident in polls, a Kansas ballot question and several special elections around the country has Republicans often looking to change the subject before the fall election. Not Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., though, who recently introduced a bill to ban abortion nationally after 15 weeks. States would also be allowed to enact stricter bans. Minnesota remains a safe haven for abortion rights in the upper Midwest under the state Supreme Court case Doe v. Gomez, but that could change with a federal ban. Heres where the 16 candidates for U.S. House stand on Grahams abortion proposal District 1 Rep. Brad Finstad, R Finstad did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill, but he has previously stated he is anti-abortion and believes the states should decide abortion rights. Jeff Ettinger, DFL Ettinger went to Twitter after the news of Grahams bill broke, calling the bill an egregious threat to womens rights. Ettinger has stated he wants to codify Roe into national law. Ettinger lost the First District special election to Finstad in August by 4 percentage points and will face Finstad again in November. District 2 Rep. Angie Craig, DFL Craig also took to Twitter to criticize Grahams bill on Sept. 14. We need to codify Roe ensure women not government are in charge of their own healthcare decisions, Craig said. Tyler Kistner, R Craigs Republican competitor Kistner did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. In 2020, Kistners stance on abortion was 100 pro-life, something he is now trying to distance himself from. A Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life survey from this summer showed Kistner said he would uphold anti-abortion laws. In a Star Tribune article published Wednesday, Kistner called abortion an extremely complex issue, but did not expand. District 3 Rep. Dean Phillips, DFL Phillips opposes Grahams bill. In response, Phillips introduced the PRO-LIFE Act, which is a set of bills to invest in maternal and childrens health, paid leave and adoption support. Rep. Phillips has been a vocal advocate for womens reproductive freedom, Phillips spokesperson Sam Anderson said. Tom Weiler, R Weiler did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. After Roe was overturned, Weiler issued a statement saying, We have a duty to care for the most vulnerable among us from the very beginning of life until the end. He has stated he would support laws that allow for abortion in the cases of rape, incest or if the mothers health is at risk. District 4 Rep. Betty McCollum, DFL McCollum responded to Grahams bill via Twitter on Sept. 13. Now that places like Kansas are deciding to protect reproductive rights, extreme Republicans are proposing a national abortion ban to control women, McCollum said. We must keep fighting to DefendWomensRights reproductive rights. May Lor Xiong, R Xiong said the states should make abortion access decisions. Keeping this debate closest to the people is where this issue should remain, Xiong said. District 5 Rep. Ilhan Omar, DFL Omar also responded to Grahams bill via Twitter on Sept. 13 saying, Roe was just the tip of the iceberg. Republicans have now made it plain as day that they do not just want to keep state abortion bans in place, but that they will ban abortions nationwide if they seize power. Cicely Davis, R Davis did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill, but she told the Star Tribune that abortion access is protected in Minnesota and she respects life from conception to death. District 6 Rep. Tom Emmer, R Emmer did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. Every life is precious, and the decision to defend it should remain with the states, Emmer said after Roe was overturned. But Emmer also co-sponsored the Heartbeat Protection Act, which was introduced in Congress in February 2021. The bill would prohibit an abortion if a doctor detects cardiac activity from the fetus, which can happen as soon as six weeks, before many women know theyre pregnant. Jeanne Hendricks, DFL Hendricks did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill specifically but has stated she wants to codify Roe. District 7 Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R Fischbach declined to comment on Grahams bill, Fischbachs spokesperson said. In her statement after Roe was overturned, Fischbach said, Todays Supreme Court decision was a step to protect the most precious and basic right the right to lifethe American people will be able to decide the issue of abortion through their elected officials. This is what democracy looks like. Jill Abahsain, DFL Abahsain did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. Abahsain told the Star Tribune that abortion is a medical procedure and should not be up for public debate. District 8 Rep. Pete Stauber, R Stauber did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. After Roe was overturned, Stauber said, This ruling is a win for the sanctity of life. Additionally, this decision also returns decision-making power back to elected officials in states as intended Jennifer Schultz, DFL Schultz opposes Grahams bill and reaffirmed her support for reproductive rights. A proposed national abortion ban on a right that we have had for the last 50 years is another attack by the Republicans to take away our freedom, Schultz said. Politicians should not be dictating our health care decisions.

Mark ReinsteinCorbis via Getty Images Why didnt Congress codify abortion rights? In the 49 years since the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade, lawmakers have attempted to both shore up abortion rights and to overturn the decision all while abortion transformed national politics. Washington Correspondent Published 2022-01-26 0940 940 January 26, 2022 am Share Twitter Facebook Your trusted source for contextualizing politics news. Sign up for our daily newsletter. When the U.S. Supreme Court in September left Texas restrictive six-week abortion ban in place, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly responded that the conservative majoritys dark-of-night decision was flagrantly unconstitutional and would be met with swift congressional action. It was. Three weeks later, the House passed by a 218-to-211 vote the Womens Health Protection Act, which would prohibit states from passing most abortion restrictions prior to fetal viability. It was opposed by all House Republicans, along with Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, the chambers last anti-abortion Democrat. The Senate has yet to act. Even if it did, the bill is unlikely to pass the evenly divided 100-seat chamber, where nearly all legislation needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster. So even as Republican state lawmakers introduce copycat bans based on the Texas law, and the Supreme Court weighs a case that could upend abortion rights, the chance of federal legislation making it to President Joe Bidens desk by November, when Democrats could lose control of the House, the Senate or both, is basically nonexistent. Forty-nine years have passed since the Supreme Courts 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade established the constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. There have been congressional attempts to pass a constitutional amendment overturning Roe, as well as efforts to codify the decision. All have failed. Along the way, abortion has transformed national politics and created a gulf between voters and party leaders to the extent that by 2019, as many as 3 in 10 Democrats and Republicans did not agree with their party on abortion, according to the Pew Research Center. Happening Now What we know about the Supreme Court draft opinion and what it could mean for abortion access Impacts of leaked Supreme Court draft decision could have a chilling effect on abortion access Calls from Democrats to codify Roe have intensified in recent months, with Roes 49th and potentially last anniversary last week, several intermediary decisions on the Texas law, and a separate case Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization before the Supreme Court concerning a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. Last month during oral arguments in that case, a majority of justices indicated that they are willing, at minimum, to weaken the viability standard set by Roe at approximately 24 weeks pregnancy. A Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs is expected by summer, and it has the potential to cap a decades-long effort by conservative abortion opponents to gut the Roe ruling and leave the issue up to the states. How the two parties arrived at this pivotal moment for abortion access involves the emergence of a new wedge issue, a realignment of the political parties, and decisions they made along the way about when and how to push for abortion regulations and to what extent. And it all happened within the past 50 years. Cecile Richards, president of the reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood and its affiliated political arm from 2006 to 2018, bristles when she hears the word controversial used to describe abortion. Public opinion has shown a majority support for abortion access that has remained remarkably consistent, she said. A June 2021 survey of U.S. attitudes about abortion rights and Roe from public opinion polling firm Gallup, for example, showed that 58 percent of Americans opposed overturning the 1973 ruling and 32 percent favored it mirroring public opinion in 1989. I think some people have a hard time wrapping their head around two different ideas One is that people have their own personal feelings about abortion, their own experience with it, what they feel like they would do, what they would want their daughter to do, Richards told The 19th. The other is that they absolutely do not want the government to make these decisions. The only thing thats changed is the politics of the Republican Party and frankly, the Democratic Party, she added. In 1975, when abortion was a newly established constitutional right, 19 percent of Democrats told Gallup that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 51 percent said it should be legal in certain cases, and 26 percent said it should be illegal in all cases. Among Republicans, the numbers were strikingly similar 18 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 55 percent said it should be in some and 25 percent said it should be illegal in all. The same poll taken in 2021 showed more Democratic voters supporting abortion in all or most cases and more Republicans supporting it in none, with sizeable majorities in both parties 91 percent of Democrats 69 percent of Republicans continuing to support abortion access in at least some cases. But the parties in Congress are less nuanced. In the House, Texas Cuellar is considered the only reliably anti-abortion Democrat and, as of 2019, there are no Republicans who support abortion rights. In the Senate, Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania both self identify as pro-life, though they have at times supported forms of abortion access, and Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have both embraced some abortion rights. As political scientists Scott Ainsworth and Thad Hall write in the 2010 book Abortion Politics in Congress When it comes to abortion, the increasingly partisan nature of abortion politics represents a case of issue evolution driven by party elites and filtering down to the masses.

She said one key to understanding abortion politics in 2021 is knowing that just several decades ago it was not considered a political issue at all. Von Hagel recalled a student who told her about a conversation with their grandmother and several others from that generation about studying the politics of reproductive rights. These older ladies were just like Why in the world is this a political issue? We never talked about it like that in the past, Von Hagel remembers the student relaying. I can still picture her face, thinking How is this possible? It was a very, very purposeful realignment that happened, Von Hagel added. Heading into the 1970s, political affiliation was not an accurate predictor for whether an individual supported abortion rights for voters or elected officials. But over the next 20 years, a political party realignment around abortion would begin to take shape.

Kevin LarkinAFP via Getty Images The term pro-life was not even in the political lexicon in 1972, when Republican Richard Nixon adopted anti-abortion positions during his presidential reelection campaign in a successful bid to win over Catholic voters, who had traditionally backed Democratic presidents, including the two before Nixon. The Supreme Courts 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade energized the anti-abortion coalition of evangelical as well as Catholic voters that began to emerge during Nixons presidency and still exists in politics today. Privately, Nixon told top aides that while he feared the ruling could encourage sexual promiscuity, he believed abortions should be available in certain circumstances, such as for pregnancies resoluting from incest or interracial relationships. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies abortion, believes that the Senate probably had a bipartisan majority that supported abortion rights when Roe was decided, but advocates did not feel a pressing need to pass legislation. It seemed to be kind of like overkill, because at the time, the abortion rights movement trusted the courts to protect abortion rights for some time, Ziegler told The 19th. During the 1976 presidential campaign, both Republican Gerald Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter opposed abortion in some cases. That year Congress for the first time approved the Hyde Amendment, which bars using federal dollars for most abortions, including in the governments Medicaid health insurance program. More Democrats than Republicans voted for for it, handing abortion rights opponents their first post-Roe victory. But some of those Democrats did so because it seemed like abortion rights were settled law and the Supreme Court would step in when it was challenged, according to Ziegler. There were some Democrats and progressives who voted for the Hyde Amendment in part because they thought the Supreme Court would invalidate it it was part of an appropriations bill, so if you liked other stuff in the appropriations bill, that was fine, because the Supreme Court would take care of it, Ziegler said. It didnt. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment in 1980. Marchers protesting the Supreme Courts decision in Roe fill Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Capitol on January 22, 1981. Herbert K. WhiteAP It was around this time that abortion started to become linked to ideology and party in ways that had not occurred before, according to Ainsworth and Hall. Republican Ronald Reagan who had relaxed abortion restrictions as Californias governor called for the appointment of anti-abortion judges during his 1980 White House campaign. By the late 1980s, he had nominated more federal judges than any president before or since, and abortion rights groups began to realize we cant really rely on the courts anymore, we need to find a way through the political process to protect access to abortion, Ziegler said. When Democrat Bill Clinton campaigned for the White House in 1992, he did so with the message that abortion should be safe, legal and rare. At the time, that was the most forceful support for abortion rights from a post-Roe president, but it has since become outmoded in Democratic politics. When Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii repeated it during the 2020 presidential primary, abortion rights advocates said she was out of step with a movement that believed rare was a concession to their opponents. Once president, Clinton marked the 20th anniversary of the Roe decision by reversing abortion restrictions put in place by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. But legislation proved harder. Though Clinton began his presidency with Democrats in control of both the House and Senate and with a majority that backed abortion rights, according to Ziegler disagreements in his own party remained over how to handle the Hyde Amendment and other specifics. Abortion rights demonstrators at the March for Womens Lives rally in Washington, D.C., on April 5, 1992. In 1992, the Supreme Court had affirmed the right to an abortion in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which challenged restrictive Pennsylvania laws. But the ruling also said states had some leeway to add some limits to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. So Democrats revived the Freedom of Choice Act that eras attempt to codify Roe. When it failed in 1993, Democratic leaders turned their focus to health care legislation. When it starts to take too long, you see the Democratic Party essentially saying Well, were not going to worry about this, well get to this later, Ziegler said. According to Michele Swers, a government professor at Georgetown University, the most aggressive Democrats got on abortion rights during this time period was the FACE Act, a law that protected clinic entrances. The window for any broader effort closed when Democrats lost control of both chambers of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections. In 1994, the Republican Party ran on its newly released Contract with America. Though by that time the partys candidates and lawmakers were increasingly aligning with the anti-abortion movement, the contract focused on 60 percent issues that had broad support from the electorate like slashing welfare programs and a balanced budget amendment. Overturning Roe was not one of them, so it was silent on abortion. The contract fueled Republican victories in the House and Senate, putting them in control of both congressional chambers for the first time since the 1950s. In early 1995, the Christian Coalition, a group founded in 1987 by religious conservative and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson that became emblematic of the Christian right, released its own contract with the American family at a news conference alongside then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of the authors of the partys 1994 platform. That contract did not propose a constitutional amendment to ban abortion outright due to practical concerns, political analysts said at the time, but it did call for restrictions on late-term abortions. Even still, intraparty divides over abortion existed. Then-Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who was considering a Republican presidential bid based on curbing religious influence on the party, told ABCs Good Morning America that he would not support it because it opposes a womans right to choose. What followed was a period when increasingly socially conservative Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents became more tenacious in supporting incremental restrictions. Republicans attached abortion-related riders to appropriations bills and repeatedly introduced what would become known as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which the Republican-controlled Congress passed twice only to be vetoed by Clinton, then eventually signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush in 2003. More from The 19th Texas six-week abortion ban will stay in effect indefinitely after Supreme Court decision to allow legal delays Abortion rights groups tie their fight to voting rights Abortion rights advocates want to hear more from Joe Biden It was during debate over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which banned abortions by dilation and extraction in the second trimester of pregnancy, that public opinion about an absolute right to legal abortion began to shift, according to tracking polls and Zieglers research and reproductive rights advocates worried they were losing the messaging battle. Even the name of the law, which adopted a term not used in medicine to describe late-term abortions, was seen as a victory for abortion opponents. In the House, the final version of the legislation was backed by 218 Republicans and 63 Democrats in the Senate, 47 Republicans and 17 Democrats. Its constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. Richards said that when she got to Planned Parenthood in 2006, the Democratic Party was still recruiting congressional candidates who did not support abortion rights. The organization really worked hard to establish that it was a fundamental right, and that it was something that the Democratic Party needed to lead on. Abortion rights advocates found an ally in then-Sen. Barack Obama, who told Planned Parenthood early in his Democratic White House bid that the first thing Id do as president would be to codify Roe by signing the latest iteration of the Freedom of Choice Act. But four months into his presidency, Obama said it was not my highest legislative priority and suggested energy would be better spent reducing unintended pregnancies. But Democratic differences on abortion threatened to derail Obamas namesake health care law. With Republicans united in opposition, Democrats could not afford to lose a single senator, and Ben Nelson, an anti-abortion Democrat from Nebraska, was the final holdout. To win his support, party leaders included a version of an amendment that does not mandate Affordable Care Act plans cover abortion, which was originally offered by another anti-abortion Democratic representative, Bart Stupak of Michigan. To appease opponents, Obama also issued an executive order reiterating that federal money would not be used to pay for abortions. Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates tried to take solace in the fact ACA plans would cover contraception. Anti-abortion activist stage a die-in in front of the White House in on January 21, 2015. Nicholas KammAFP via Getty Images In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans picked up more than 60 House seats to retake control of that chamber and added seven in the Senate as part of the tea party wave. Republican efforts picked up to defund Planned Parenthood by denying the organization state and federal money throughout the rest of Obamas presidency, many of them spearheaded by then-Rep. Mike Pence. In 2015, Republican House Speaker John Boehner resigned in part due to repeated battles with the conservative Freedom Caucus over their desire to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood funding. In January 2016, Planned Parenthood, under Richards leadership, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clintons White House bid. It was the first time the organization had made an endorsement in a presidential primary, but as Richards told the New York Times Everything Planned Parenthood has believed in and fought for over the past 100 years is on the ballot. When Clinton accepted the endorsement and announced that she supported repealing the Hyde Amendment, the Guardian called it truly surprising and Salon said it was a game changer. Hyde Amendment repeal ended up in the Democratic Partys official policy platform a move polling showed was popular with the partys base but less so with the broader electorate. Clinton went on to lose the November 2016 election to Republican Donald Trump, who said he was running to be a pro-life president and had taken a number of anti-abortion stances during his campaign. He was the first sitting president to attend the annual March for Life rally and appointed three Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett who cemented the courts conservative anti-abortion majority. By the time the 2020 Democratic presidential primary got underway, the sizable field of contenders all supported some version of Roe codification and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, citing the Trump administrations attempts to curb abortion access and restrictive laws recently enacted in Georgia and Alabama. To run for president as a Democrat in 2020 meant unequivocally supporting abortion rights and for Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, it necessitated an evolution. After Biden joined the Senate in 1973, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to overturn the courts Roe ruling. In a Washingtonian magazine interview at the time, he said of Roe I think it went too far. I dont think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body. But times changed, and so did he. In a 2007 book, Biden said he had arrived at a middle-of-the-road position on abortion. In 2008, he described Roe as close to a consensus that can exist in a society as heterogeneous as ours. As Obamas vice president, Biden said the government had no right to tell other people that women, they cant control their own body. By the 2020 presidential primary, his abortion politics matched the partys base. Biden went on to drop the Hyde Amendment in his first budget proposal. Early in his presidency, he also rescinded the Mexico City Policy, known as the global gag rule, which requires foreign organizations to certify they will not promote abortion as a condition for receiving U.S. aid for reproductive health care. In October, his administration reversed a Trump-era regulation that barred health care providers receiving Title X family planning funds from mentioning abortion care to patients as an option. People attend this years March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington on January 21. Susan WalshAP Biden has emphasized codifying Roe as a proxy for his larger abortion messaging and has said he would sign the Womens Health Protection Act if it were to make it to his desk. But, with anti-abortion conservatives anticipating judicial victory, it is unclear what, if anything Bidens administration or Democrats in Congress can deliver legislatively. Since Democrats lack a legislative path to head off the Dobbs decision, they have turned to making the case that voters should reinforce their congressional majorities in the 2022 midterms, believing the partys support for abortion access will benefit their candidates up and down the ballot. We are in a total stalemate in Congress and it would take extraordinary leadership by this president and frankly, by the Democrats in the United States Senate, to do anything legislatively to codify Roe, Richards said. I dont think most people, unless they live in the state of Texas, know what is potentially coming, she added.

Key developments include:
	1.	Reagan Era: President Ronald Reagan, who initially had a moderate stance on abortion, shifted right during his 1980 campaign, emphasizing anti-abortion policies. He appointed a record number of federal judges who shared his views, signaling to abortion rights advocates that they could no longer rely solely on the courts and must pursue legislative solutions to safeguard abortion access.
	2.	Clinton Administration: When Democrat Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992, he supported making abortion “safe, legal, and rare,” the most progressive stance on abortion for a president up to that time. Once elected, he reversed Reagan-era abortion restrictions but faced intra-party divisions on how to legislate these protections, especially around the Hyde Amendment. His attempt to pass the Freedom of Choice Act to codify Roe failed due to these divisions.
	3.	1990s Shifts in Republican Strategy: The 1994 “Contract with America,” which led Republicans to significant victories, focused on unifying issues rather than polarizing ones like abortion. However, the Christian Coalition later pushed the GOP towards stricter abortion stances. Republican lawmakers increasingly supported incremental restrictions, such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which Clinton vetoed but was eventually signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003.
	4.	Obama’s Approach: Barack Obama, who initially promised to codify Roe, prioritized other issues once in office. Despite securing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), internal divisions over abortion, especially from pro-life Democrats, resulted in compromises like not requiring ACA plans to cover abortion. Obama later issued an executive order ensuring federal funds wouldn’t pay for abortions, further highlighting Democratic divisions on the issue.
	5.	Republican Gains During the Tea Party Era: The 2010 midterms saw Republicans regain the House, spurred by the Tea Party movement, leading to intensified efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. High-profile clashes included demands to shut down the government over abortion funding, which contributed to Speaker John Boehner’s resignation in 2015.
	6.	Clinton vs. Trump (2016): Planned Parenthood’s endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary marked its first primary endorsement. Clinton, running on a pro-choice platform, advocated for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, signaling a shift in Democratic attitudes. Conversely, Donald Trump’s campaign marked the GOP’s firm anti-abortion stance, which he underscored by appointing conservative judges to the Supreme Court.
	7.	Biden’s Shift: Joe Biden’s stance on abortion evolved over the decades, culminating in his 2020 campaign supporting codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment. As president, he dropped the Hyde Amendment from his budget and rolled back Trump-era restrictions on reproductive health care. However, with a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, his administration faces challenges in enacting federal abortion protections.
	8.	Democratic Strategy Ahead of 2022: Facing potential challenges from a Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Democrats have focused on the importance of state and midterm elections, urging voters to support pro-choice candidates to preserve abortion rights legislatively.

In sum, the article traces the decades-long, contentious interplay between U.S. political parties, judicial rulings, and public opinion on abortion, culminating in the present-day uncertainties surrounding federal protections for abortion rights.","['Congress', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'NonCom', 'No', '##D', '##ives Creative Commons', 'The 19th', 'The 19th', '19th News Network', '19th News Network', 'Black South Carolinian', 'Nikki Haley Brandon Tensley', 'Capital B', 'Alabama Supreme Court', 'Alander Rocha', 'Alabama Reflector', 'Bekah McNeel', 'So', '##rners', 'Amendment', 'Amendment Down South', 'Tressie McMillan Co', 'Errin Haines', 'Amendment', 'Amendment', 'Nikole Hannah - Jones', 'Chabeli Carrazana', 'Jasmine Mi', 'Marie', '##di', 'Dar', 'Davis', '##abby', 'Jennifer', '##erson', 'Sarah McBride', 'Congress', 'Orion', 'First', 'Hawaiian', '##dice Norwood']","This article traces the evolution of abortion rights in the United States from the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 to the shifting political landscape of recent decades. Roe initially provided a federal right to abortion, sparking long-standing debates and partisan divisions. In the 1980s, Republican President Ronald Reagan, who had previously supported some abortion access, shifted his stance to call for anti-abortion judicial appointments, signaling a conservative push to limit Roe’s impact. This era catalyzed a reliance on political avenues by abortion rights groups who felt they could no longer depend on the courts.

President Bill Clinton campaigned with the message that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” representing the strongest pro-abortion rights stance in the presidency post-Roe, though this has since evolved in Democratic circles. Clinton’s presidency saw the revival of the Freedom of Choice Act aimed at codifying Roe, but intraparty disagreements and a Republican-controlled Congress in the mid-1990s stymied further legislative progress. Republicans, propelled by their Contract with America and increasingly influenced by the Christian Coalition, avoided an outright abortion ban but advocated for incremental restrictions, like the controversial Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which eventually passed under President George W. Bush.

The Obama administration promised to codify Roe but faced significant internal conflicts, notably within the Affordable Care Act’s drafting, where compromises on abortion provisions were necessary to secure votes from anti-abortion Democrats. Despite Obama’s symbolic actions, like rescinding the global gag rule, these compromises underscored the party’s evolving but still complex stance on abortion.

The rise of the Tea Party in 2010 amplified Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, with anti-abortion leaders like then-Congressman Mike Pence leading initiatives to restrict funding. Planned Parenthood responded by endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2016, marking its first endorsement in a presidential primary, as Clinton took a strong stand on abortion, including advocating for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal abortion funding.

Donald Trump’s presidency marked a conservative turning point with his anti-abortion judicial appointments, including three Supreme Court justices who shifted the court’s balance. In response, the Democratic field in the 2020 primary uniformly supported codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment. President Joe Biden, who once held a moderate stance on abortion, evolved in line with his party’s base, supporting Roe’s codification and removing the Hyde Amendment in his budget proposal.

Biden’s administration has taken steps to reverse Trump-era restrictions, such as rescinding the Mexico City Policy and allowing Title X funds to be used by providers that discuss abortion. With the Supreme Court’s anticipated ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Democrats have increasingly framed abortion as a critical electoral issue for the 2022 midterms, warning that expanded Republican majorities could lead to further restrictive laws across the nation.",L,

Wade, the legality of abortion was sent back to states immediately reviving Wisconsins pre-Civil War abortion ban. Few if any states reverted to laws as old as Wisconsins. Over the nearly 50 years the ban was unenforceable, why had lawmakers never revoked it? Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPRs email newsletter. Email PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. In some ways, the answer is simple There was never the political will. And in the years immediately following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the political lines when it came to abortion were blurred. It would take nearly a decade for the major parties in Wisconsin, and the nation, to begin to adopt unified stances on abortion.And even as those stances coalesced, Democrats never amassed the legislative majorities they would need in Wisconsin to revoke the ban. Joanne Duren of Cazenovia, speaks after an Assembly vote on the bill she authored to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions on March 8, 1978. The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images The first significant post-Roe abortion legislation in Wisconsin was a bipartisan bill to restrict the procedure.Rep. Joanne Duren of Cazenovia was a Democrat, a devout Catholic and a passionate abortion opponent. She shepherded the 1978 proposal, which would prevent people from using Medicaid to pay for abortions, through months of legislative wrangling.This will move the state from an economic policy of killing human life to a policy which favors child-bearing and childbirth, Duren told colleagues during one of the lengthy debates on the bill.Democrats held two-thirds supermajorities in both the Assembly and the Senate but they were deeply divided on this issue. Nevertheless, Duren was optimistic the proposal would pass. Religious organizations and church leaders supported the plan, calling and writing lawmakers and showing up to testify at hearings. A sizable majority of lawmakers, it appeared, was ready to listen.Abortion rights activists hoping to stop the bill descended on Madison, shouting at lawmakers in the Assembly and Senate. They were ejected from the chambers as some threw pipe cleaners shaped like coathangers from the galleries, a reference to a crude instrument sometimes used for dangerous, self-induced abortions. Youre killing women, a protester shouted, according to newspaper coverage of the time. Sen. Michele Radosevich was a freshman Democratic lawmaker when a bill to bar the use of Medicaid funds for abortion came before the Legislature. Radosevich said she was compelled to speak out against what she saw as a cruel bill. Her words landed her on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal on Feb. 17, 1978. Image courtesy Wisconsin State Journal Down on the floor, emotions among lawmakers also ran hot. One suggested government funded abortions would empower promiscuous women.The rhetoric rankled Michele Radosevich, then a freshman Democratic senator from North Hudson. She opposed the bill, which she described as cruel because it targeted poor women.Gentlemen, compassion, please, Radosevich said at the time. When you face your God, I wonder what you will tell him.The debate lasted days. There were lengthy hearings and dozens of amendments. The bill pinged back and forth between houses before it was finally approved by the Legislature on March 8, 1978. After all that, Gov. Martin Schreiber, also a Democrat, vetoed the bill the same night.I know for sure that a pregnant woman is a human being a person, he said when explaining his veto. I, in my own mind, do not know when a fetus becomes a human being a person.The infighting among Democrats did not end that night. They organized an attempt to override Schreibers veto. And they came within two votes of succeeding. Martin J. Schreiber was the Democratic governor of Wisconsin from 1977-79. In this speech from 1978, he says, I know for sure that a pregnant woman is a human being, a person. I, in my own mind, do not know when a fetus becomes a human being, a person. We are placing an unfair amount of weight imbalance to something which is unknown against that of a human being of which I can touch, of which I can relate to, of which I can have compassion for. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images Democrats would have restricted abortion further if it werent for pro-choice RepublicansAt this moment in time, the parties were split on abortion throughout the country, said Mary Ziegler, a leading expert on the history of abortion in the post-Roe v. Wade era.In the 70s, the parties didnt have clear identities yet entirely when it came to abortion, she said. The idea that the Republican Party was the party of life, as Ronald Reagan put it, or the anti-abortion party, and the Democrats were supportive of legal abortion wouldnt really coalesce until the early 80s.That divide played out in the 1978 debate on abortion. Rep. Sheehan Donoghue, a Republican, was instrumental in defeating the bill, not only voting to uphold Schreibers veto but also delivering an impassioned speech that at least one lawmaker credited with changing his mind.Ladies and gentlemen, Donoghue told her colleagues, What you do here today, you will have to live with the rest of your lives.Today, Donoghue is retired, living in northern Wisconsin. She still remembers the debate and her reasons for opposing the bill.This legislation, in my opinion, did damage to the equality of women in control over their own bodies, she said. She said she was particularly concerned the bill while it included exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother did not account for pregnancies that could harm the health of the mother. I found a real inconsistency there, she remembered. And I thought it was cruel towards women who happened to be on welfare, who had some problem, some physical problem, if the pregnancy would incapacitate them but not kill them.The veto override failed by two votes, meaning Donoghue and other Republicans who opposed the bill were critical to its defeat.But it wasnt a clear-cut victory for abortion rights lawmakers. Days after Schreibers veto, the Legislature passed a more limited bill that included protections for the health of a mother. Schreiber who said he was personally opposed to abortion signed it into law.

The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images As anti-abortion voters organize, the parties split The bipartisan coalitions that worked for and against the bill would be hard to imagine today, but Radosevich, the Democratic lawmaker who spoke so fervently on the floor, said they were common in the late 70s.It was a very different time in terms of party alignment, she said.Still, Radosevich, a freshman lawmaker from a competitive district, knew the power of the abortion issue with voters. She had originally planned to stay quiet during debate and acknowledge that some of her Democratic colleagues were just a little bit scared of the voters back home. Their silence, and the arguments from anti-abortion lawmakers, propelled her to speak up. That landed her on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal. She said she thinks that public stance, and the ensuing attention, contributed to her losing her next election.But, you know, theres no way I could have voted for the bill and looked at myself in the mirror the next day, she said.On the other side of the abortion debate from Radosevich was Gary Goyke, then a Democratic state senator from Oshkosh. He voted in favor of the bill restricting Medicaid funds, telling WPR he viewed it, at the time, as the government removing itself from the abortion decision.But Goyke described it as a turning point for him, personally. He said he began to move more toward embracing abortion rights, including in his unsuccessful bid for Congress just a year later.That personal evolution wasnt without consequence. Goyke, a Catholic, remembers being confronted at church.A lady would come sit right in the front row. And at every service that I was at every Mass I was at she would stand up and say, Let us pray that Sen. Goyke learns to respect life, he remembered. And then the parish would say, Lord, hear our prayer. And I am sitting right in front.It was around this time when politically active anti-abortion voters were becoming a force in the Republican Party. But it didnt happen overnight.

And its probably also what led me to be a Republican.Lorman said she always viewed her position on abortion as consistent with traditional Republican values, like minimizing government control over peoples lives. At the time, she says none of her Senate colleagues objected.You know, almost anybody could fit in either party, frankly, Lorman said.But by 1994, it was a different story. After the 1990 Census, Republicans redrew her district, making it a lot more conservative a safe seat for the GOP.She drew a primary challenge from Scott Fitzgerald whom she describes as a darling of the right wing and says anti-abortion activists threw their weight behind him immediately.Those are very devoted, conscientious voters. And like overnight, yard signs went up and down the highway, she said. And I saw that and I thought, Uh oh, this is gonna be a problem.Fitzgerald won and went on to serve in the Senate for decades. Hed later become the Senates Majority Leader and now represents the area in Congress.The win was more than symbolic. In 1997, Fitzgerald was the lead sponsor of a law that banned partial birth abortion in Wisconsin, one of several incremental abortion restrictions championed by the anti-abortion movement in the decades since Roe.

Angela MajorWPR Democrats undergo their own shift, but slowly Democrats were undergoing their own shift toward abortion rights politics. In the 1990 race for attorney general, for example, the Republican incumbent signed on to a legal brief that supported overturning Roe v. Wade. His Democratic challenger, Jim Doyle, used it to campaign against him.That was the number one issue, Doyle said. Thats how I got elected. So it really was always a very important issue to me.Doyle later became governor and in 2009, Democrats won majorities in the Senate and Assembly. The party once again had complete control over state government for the first time in decades.Among the Democrats swept into office was Kelda Roys, a Madison state representative who, at 29, was the youngest member of the Legislature. Roys won a Democratic primary for her seat, in part, by touting her work as a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice, an abortion rights group.I came in just full of energy and optimism, Roys said. Like, Lets do all the things.One of her most ambitious goals To overturn the dormant pre-Civil War abortion ban she knew was still on the books. Gov.

Behind are Senate President Fred Risser, left, and Speak of the Assembly Mike Huebsch, right. Morry GashAP Photo There were two problems, as Roys remembers. She said some abortion rights Democrats took Roe v. Wade for granted as settled law. And while Democrats held a slim overall majority, when it came to the issue of abortion, they didnt really have one at all. A handful of Democrats were still staunchly anti-abortion.It seemed like something that was symbolic, she said of taking on the dormant law. And so there just wasnt necessarily the big appetite to do it. And we didnt have the votes in that particular session, because we had all these anti-choice folks in our caucus.Bob Ziegelbauer was one of the Legislatures remaining anti-abortion Democrats. Now the Manitowoc County Executive, he says his stance on the issue was clear to everyone in the Democratic caucus. He doesnt remember ever being approached about working to lift the abortion ban.They wouldnt even think of asking me that, because it was so clear, he said. It didnt come up, because they knew me and I knew them.The cordial relationship came to an end during a debate on the 2009 state budget. Ziegelbauer supported a Republican amendment to restrict abortion, infuriating Democratic leadership. In response, they stripped him of a committee chairmanship. Later, Ziegelbauer left the party.That was the only time I crossed that line. And that line is pretty bright, Ziegelbauer said. They dont want you doing that.The 2009 session of the Legislature was defined by a difficult state budget and debates on issues ranging from payday loans to global warming to raw milk. Discussions of Wisconsins pre-Civil War abortion ban never surfaced publicly.The ironic twist to Democrats new fight The Democratic majority of 2009 was short-lived. In 2010, a Republican wave election gave the GOP control of the Legislature and brought Scott Walker into the governors office. That Republican coalition was much more willing to use its power to effect abortion law. In just a few years, they passed laws ending state funding for Planned Parenthood, requiring patients seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound first and banning abortion after 20 weeks.Anti-abortion victories around the country culminated in 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. For the abortion rights Democratic Party, it was the worst case scenario something advocates like Roys had warned could happen.Strictly politically speaking, however, that moment had a galvanizing effect for Wisconsin Democrats. Last fall, Democratic Gov.Tony Evers, who was viewed as vulnerable in his bid for reelection, ran hard on the issue of abortion and won. Kimberly resident Melissa Johnson holds a sign in support of Wisconsin state supreme court candidate Judge Janet Protasiewicz during a rally Saturday, March 11, 2023, in Appleton, Wis. Angela MajorWPR This spring, Justice Janet Protasiewicz likewise placed abortion rights front and center in her campaign for state Supreme Court. That proved a winning strategy for her campaign, too. When Protasiewicz was sworn in earlier this month, liberals gained a majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years. That state Supreme Court could have the final say on any challenges to Wisconsins abortion laws. If a pending lawsuit succeeds, the abortion ban could be gone.Todays Democratic Party is pushing hard for this. The state party poured millions of dollars into Protasiewiczs campaign, and earlier this year, every single Democratic member of the Legislature supported a proposal to overturn the states abortion ban.If the ban is overturned, abortion would once again be legal in Wisconsin, but the laws that were passed in the years after Roe would also be restored.That means decades worth of abortion restrictions would again be the law of the land from the Medicaid restrictions passed in 1978, to the 20-week abortion ban signed by Walker in 2015.With the parties now firmly entrenched on this issue, the fight over abortion in post-Roe Wisconsin would go on.For more from How We Got Here Abortion in Wisconsin since 1849, visit wpr.org1849.

This ban, dating back to 1849, was dormant for decades, only to be revived following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Despite periodic efforts to address abortion rights, Wisconsin lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, failed to repeal the ban during the nearly 50 years that it was unenforceable. One key reason was the lack of political will, as abortion politics were highly divided in the years after Roe v. Wade (1973). In the 1970s, even as abortion rights activists fought against restrictive measures, like the bill limiting Medicaid funding for abortion, there was no unified stance on abortion within either party. While the bill was vetoed by Democratic Governor Martin Schreiber in 1978, abortion opponents, including some Republicans, played a crucial role in defeating it.

Throughout the late 20th century, both parties saw shifts in their positions on abortion. For example, some Republican legislators, like Barbara Lorman, initially supported abortion access, but by the 1990s, the anti-abortion movement had gained significant traction, especially after redistricting led to more conservative Republican candidates like Scott Fitzgerald taking office. Fitzgerald would later sponsor laws that restricted abortion further, such as banning partial-birth abortions in 1997.

On the Democratic side, the shift towards pro-abortion rights stances was gradual. In the 2009 legislative session, Kelda Roys, a Democratic representative, sought to repeal the dormant 1849 abortion ban, but her efforts were hampered by internal divisions within her party. The Democratic majority in Wisconsin was short-lived, as the 2010 Republican wave saw anti-abortion policies gaining ground.

The 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade triggered renewed efforts to challenge the state’s pre-Civil War abortion ban. In the years since, Wisconsin Democrats have rallied around the issue, with Governor Tony Evers and Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz campaigning strongly for abortion rights. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, now with a liberal majority, may soon have the final say on whether the 1849 ban is overturned, potentially restoring abortion legality while also enforcing restrictions that were passed in the intervening years.

Ultimately, the battle over abortion in Wisconsin remains unresolved, with both parties now firmly entrenched in their respective positions.","['Wisconsin', 'Civil War', 'W', 'Wisconsin Public Radio', 'Wisconsin Public Radio', 'Supreme Court', 'Wisconsin', 'Civil War', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Anya van Wagtendonk', 'Shawn Johnson', 'Madison', 'Madison', 'Wis', 'Midwest Medical Center', 'Dade County', 'AP', 'Wisconsin Public Radio', 'We', 'Wisconsin', 'WPR', 'Wisconsin', 'U', 'S.

This dormant law, which was resurrected following the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, had remained largely untouched despite decades of political debate.

Key points include:
	•	Historical Context: Wisconsin’s pre-Civil War abortion ban had been on the books since 1849. Following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the law was unenforceable, but it was never formally repealed.
	•	Political Dynamics: In the 1970s and 1980s, abortion politics were less polarized. In 1978, a bipartisan bill to restrict Medicaid funding for abortion sparked intense debates, with some Democratic lawmakers, like Rep. Joanne Duren, advocating for restrictions, while others, like Sen. Michele Radosevich, opposed it. Ultimately, Democratic Governor Martin Schreiber vetoed the bill, though anti-abortion forces in the legislature continued to push for restrictions.
	•	Shifting Alliances: Over time, the political parties began to solidify their positions on abortion. The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of anti-abortion activists within the Republican Party, while Democrats gradually embraced abortion rights as a key issue. In 1994, Scott Fitzgerald, a rising Republican star, became a vocal advocate for anti-abortion laws.
	•	2009 and Beyond: In 2009, when Democrats gained control of Wisconsin’s state government, efforts to repeal the old abortion ban were stymied by divisions within the party, with some Democrats opposing abortion rights. This window of opportunity closed after the 2010 Republican wave, leading to stricter abortion laws under Governor Scott Walker, including a 20-week abortion ban.
	•	Post-Roe Era: The 2022 Roe v. Wade reversal reignited the abortion debate in Wisconsin. Democratic Governor Tony Evers and state Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz prominently campaigned on abortion rights, leading to victories that could potentially overturn the dormant 1849 ban. With a more liberal majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the issue is likely to be revisited, with the potential to restore access to abortion while keeping other state-level restrictions intact.

The article underscores how Wisconsin’s abortion laws have evolved amid shifting political allegiances and the ongoing battle between pro-choice and anti-abortion factions. The state’s legal landscape remains uncertain, with the future of the 1849 abortion ban potentially resting on upcoming judicial decisions.",C,

Zurawski and a dozen other women argue in a lawsuit that Texas doctors and hospitals denied them necessary care because the providers were afraid to run afoul of the states abortion ban. Eric GayThe Associated Press Read more Stateline coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions. AUSTIN, Texas A lawsuit in Texas asserting that the states abortion ban imperils women by dissuading doctors from ending dangerous pregnancies could provide a template for similar challenges across the country. Texas is one of 14 states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The Texas ban includes an exception that allows physicians to end a pregnancy if it could result in the death of the woman or a substantial impairment of a major bodily function. But the plaintiffs in the case, more than a dozen Texas women, argue that doctors and hospitals denied them necessary care because the providers were afraid to run afoul of the law. Those who violate the ban could face up to 99 years in prison, a 100,000 fine and loss of their medical license. Even before the Texas case was filed in March, the same issues were surfacing in other abortion-ban states, generating national attention and intense interest among elected officials in Washington, D.C. Attorneys for the Texas plaintiffs predict that similar suits will be filed in other states. Nicolas Kabat, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, the New York-based advocacy group that filed the Texas suit, said the problem is widespread across states that ban abortion. Were being contacted by dozens of women telling us similar stories, Kabat told Stateline, saying were really only scratching the surface here. Positive polling, past successes dont guarantee victory for abortion rights at the ballot box Citing press accounts, the plaintiffs petition points to about two dozen women in 11 states outside Texas who have had experiences like those of the Texas women Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. Its an incredibly important lawsuit and it has implications not only in Texas but in other states that have denied people the right to safe abortion health care, said former Texas Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, a senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes who gained national attention a decade ago for her filibuster against a polarizing anti-abortion rights bill. Attorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights are asking Travis County District Judge Jessica Mangrum to grant a temporary injunction and craft a new exception to Texas abortion ban that gives physicians and hospitals more latitude to provide pregnancy care and perform abortions. But lawyers for the Texas attorney generals office, representing the state, depict the suit as a bald attempt to usurp state authority over abortion policy. Mangrum, elected as a Democrat, presided over two days of arguments and testimony in mid-July. She told lawyers at the end of the hearing that it will likely be several weeks before she returns a ruling. First State Law to Criminalize Abortion Trafficking May Inspire Others At last months hearing, the plaintiffs recounted their anguishing personal ordeals after they were refused abortions. Amanda Zurawski of Austin, the lead plaintiff, nearly died after she was refused an abortion after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy. Zurawski and her husband, Josh, had already picked the name for their unborn daughter Willow and were planning a baby shower when they received the devastating news that they would lose their first child before birth. Amanda, 36, was diagnosed with a weakening of cervical tissue and told that Willow would not survive. But doctors initially refused to perform an abortion, she said, because they could detect fetal cardiac activity. Several days later, she developed sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection, and spent three days in intensive care, struggling to survive. Zurawski told Stateline in a phone interview that hundreds of people have reached out to her via social media to share similar stories and offer support. After the hearing last month, Zurawski said, she heard from tons and tons and tons of people just an outpouring of support, people wanting to get involved, wanting to help. Other plaintiffs told similarly harrowing stories at the hearing. Taylor Edwards, also from Austin, said she learned when she was 17 weeks pregnant that her daughter had a fatal condition called encephalocele, a protrusion of the brain through an opening in the skull, and would die at or before birth. She had to leave Texas to get an abortion. Lauren Hall, who lives near Dallas, discovered that her unborn child had anencephaly, a serious birth defect that prevents the fetus from developing parts of the brain and skull. Halls obstetrician refused to perform an abortion and was afraid to refer her to an abortion provider in another state. Hall eventually got an abortion at a clinic near Seattle. Studies conducted by abortion rights university research groups suggest that abortion bans are dissuading doctors in many states from providing care they would otherwise provide. Its an incredibly important lawsuit and it has implications not only in Texas but in other states that have denied people the right to safe abortion health care. Former Texas Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis A total of 50 anonymous surveys from health care providers in states with abortion restrictions detailed cases of care that deviated from the usual standard due to new laws restricting abortion, according to a study jointly conducted by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin and Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. In several cases, patients experienced preventable complications because clinicians reported their hands were tied, making it impossible for them to provide treatment sooner, according to the study. But anti-abortion rights advocates, including some physicians, dispute the contention that Texas medical exception is too vague to give doctors the confidence to perform necessary procedures. The language of the exception, they say, clearly gives doctors the leeway to use their medical judgment and to intervene in an emergency. They say they have sympathy for the plaintiffs but support the states contention that it would be inappropriate for Mangrum or any other judge to rewrite the abortion ban exception, since that would usurp a legislative function. Theyre trying to have the judiciary write the law, which is not appropriate, said Dr. Ingrid Skop, a San Antonio OB-GYN who testified for the state at last months hearing. The current state law clearly allows a doctor to use his reasonable medical judgment to determine when to intervene in a medical emergency to protect a womans life. Theres not a problem with the way the law is worded, she said. The problem is that the doctors have become confused, and they become frightened. In many cases, they have not been given guidance by medical societies or by their hospitals, and they often have been slow in offering interventions. Joe Pojman, founder and executive director of the Texas Alliance for Life, one of the states leading anti-abortion rights groups, also defended the medical exception. The law is already clear, he said. Judges are supposed to interpret the law, not rewrite the law. Activists Aim for Supreme Court With Local Abortion Bans in Blue States The suit names the state of Texas, the Texas Medical Board and Board Executive Director Stephen Brint Carlton as defendants. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, is also a defendant, though he is currently suspended pending a state Senate trial on impeachment charges alleging bribery and other wrongdoing. Lawyers for the attorney generals office, who could not be reached for comment, are asking the court to dismiss the suit. In a rebuttal petition, they accuse the plaintiffs of staging splashy news conferences and media tours to get a favorable court ruling after failing to convince the Legislature to adopt their preferred version of the medical exception. A proposed court order by the plaintiffs asks the court to give physicians discretion to use good faith judgment in providing abortion care to someone with unsafe pregnancy complications or instances in which a fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy or live after birth. But attorneys for the state say the plaintiffs proposed exception would, by design, swallow the rule, permitting abortions for pregnant females with medical conditions ranging from a headache to feelings of depression. Amanda Zurawski said shes always supported abortion rights but that her personal experience molded her into an impassioned advocate of the right to an abortion. She and her husband, she said, never wanted to be the poster family for this cause, but now theyre in the fight wholeheartedly. Id rather be at home with my newborn right now. Thats the life that I was envisioning. I would rather be on maternity leave with my daughter, not having to fight this fight, she said. But, you know, I think its really been empowering for me. And its actually been quite healing to have a cause and a purpose to put behind our loss and our grief.

Texas, along with 13 other states, banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. While the law permits abortions to save a woman’s life or prevent major bodily harm, the plaintiffs claim that physicians are fearful of violating the law, which could lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

The plaintiffs, including Amanda Zurawski, who nearly died from sepsis after being denied an abortion when her water broke at 18 weeks, argue that hospitals and doctors are refusing essential care out of fear of legal repercussions. Their stories highlight cases where medical conditions, such as fatal birth defects, were not treated promptly, as doctors were hesitant to intervene due to the vagueness of the law’s medical exception. This lawsuit, which seeks to expand the exception and allow doctors more discretion, is seen as a potential model for similar cases in other states with abortion restrictions.

The case is not only significant for Texas but could also have wide-reaching implications for other states with similar abortion bans. Attorneys for the plaintiffs are asking for a temporary injunction to modify the law, while state attorneys argue that the law already provides adequate flexibility for medical judgment. The outcome of this lawsuit may shape future legal challenges to abortion bans nationwide, as it highlights the potential risks of limiting access to abortion care and the concerns raised by healthcare providers under these restrictions.","['Texas', 'care Education Environment Society', 'Justice', '##IB', 'Texas', 'David Montgomery', 'Amanda Zurawski', 'Molly Duane', 'Travis County Courthouse', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'Zurawski', 'Texas', 'Eric Gay', 'Associated Press', 'AUSTIN', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'U', 'S', 'Supreme Court', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'Washington', 'Texas', 'Nicolas Ka', 'Center', 'York', 'Texas', 'Ka']","A lawsuit filed in Texas challenges the state’s abortion ban, asserting that it endangers women’s health by discouraging doctors from terminating dangerous pregnancies. The plaintiffs, including Amanda Zurawski, claim that doctors and hospitals refused to provide necessary medical care out of fear of violating the law, which penalizes violators with up to 99 years in prison. The case is particularly significant as it may set a precedent for similar lawsuits in other states with abortion bans following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade.

The Texas law permits abortions only if a woman’s life is at risk or there is a significant risk to major bodily functions, but the plaintiffs argue that the law’s vagueness has led to confusion and fear among healthcare providers. In some cases, such as Zurawski’s, women have suffered health complications or life-threatening conditions while waiting for treatment. Zurawski, who developed sepsis after being denied an abortion despite her water breaking at 18 weeks, is one of several women who have shared similar harrowing experiences in the lawsuit.

Attorneys representing the plaintiffs, led by the Center for Reproductive Rights, seek a new legal exception to allow more flexibility for physicians to provide necessary care. They also argue that the issue is not unique to Texas, as women in other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Arizona, and Florida, have faced similar issues. Former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis supports the lawsuit, asserting its broader implications for states that restrict abortion access.

On the other hand, opponents of the lawsuit, including anti-abortion advocates and some doctors, defend the medical exceptions in the law, claiming they allow enough leeway for medical judgment in emergencies. They argue that the confusion among doctors is due to a lack of guidance rather than an inherent flaw in the law itself.

The case is still ongoing, with Travis County District Judge Jessica Mangrum expected to rule in the coming weeks. The outcome could have significant implications for abortion laws in other states and could influence future legal challenges across the nation.",L,

Wade, undoing a nationwide right to abortion that had been in place for nearly 50 years. It comes as state lawmakers in Republican-led states have moved to drastically limit abortion access and as GOP presidential candidates wrestle with how to approach the issue. While the laws have changed over the past year, the poll found that opinions on abortion remain much as they were a year ago complex, with most people believing abortion should be allowed in some circumstances and not in others. Overall, about two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, but only about a quarter say it should always be legal and only about 1 in 10 say it should always be illegal.

Id rather the person abort the baby than harm the baby or throw the baby out or anything, she said in an interview. But she said that around 20 weeks into pregnancy, she thinks abortion should not usually be an option. When theyre fully developed and the mother doesnt have any illnesses or anything that would cause the baby or her to pass away, its like youre killing another human, she said. Thomas state allows abortion until the fetus would be viable, generally considered to be around 24 weeks, and has become a destination for people from neighboring Kentucky, Missouri, Wisconsin and other places with travel bans for abortions. The poll finds that 1 in 10 Americans say they know someone who has either been unable to get an abortion or who has had to travel to get one in the last year, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and that this is especially common among young people, people of color and those living in states where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. Nearly half the states now allow abortion until between 20 and 27 weeks but bar it later than that in most cases. Before the end of Roe, almost every state fell in that range. Now, abortion is banned with varying exceptions at all stages of pregnancy in 14 states, including much of the South.The poll found that 73 of all U.S. adults, including 58 of those in states with the strictest bans, believe abortion should be allowed at six weeks of pregnancy. Just one state currently has a ban in effect that kicks in around then. Thats Georgia, where abortion is banned once cardiac activity can be detected around six weeks and before women often know theyre pregnant. Ohio and South Carolina have similar bans that are not being enforced because of court action, and Florida has one that hasnt taken effect. Iowa lawmakers late Tuesday passed a bill that would add it to those ranks once it is signed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds later this week. About half of Americans say abortions should be permitted at the 15-week mark, though 55 of those living in the most restrictive states say abortion should be banned by that point. And by 24 weeks, about two-thirds of Americans, including those who live in states with the fewest restrictions, say it should be barred.While most GOP-controlled state governments have been pushing for more abortion restrictions, the poll finds that theres not always support for doing so. Nationally, about 4 in 10 people said it was too difficult to access abortion in their community, compared with about a quarter who think its too easy.

People in states with the strictest bans were slightly more likely to say abortion was too difficult to access compared with those living in the least restrictive states. Overall, about half of Democrats say its too difficult, compared with 22 of Republicans.And women were more likely to say access was too challenging in their area. For both Republicans and Democrats, there was not much of a gender divide on the topic About half of both Democratic men and women found it too challenging, and around 2 in 10 GOP men and women did. But nearly half of independent women thought so, compared with about one-third of independent men.The poll of 1,220 adults was conducted June 22-26 using a sample drawn from NORCs probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

She develops and writes about polls conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, and works on AP VoteCast.","A recent AP-NORC poll reveals that a majority of U.S. adults, including those in states with strict abortion laws, support the legality of abortion at least through the early stages of pregnancy. Conducted in late June, the poll highlights that most Americans, one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, still believe abortion should be permitted in certain circumstances, though opinions vary by stage of pregnancy.

While about two-thirds of Americans generally support abortion rights, only around 25% believe abortion should always be legal, and just 10% say it should always be illegal. A majority agree that abortion should be allowed at least until six weeks of pregnancy, which is the current limit in Georgia. However, by the 15-week mark, half of Americans favor restrictions, with the majority in stricter states advocating for a ban at this stage. Most Americans oppose abortion after 24 weeks.

The poll also found that nearly half of Americans say it is difficult to access abortion services in their community, especially in states with stricter laws. Young people, people of color, and those living in abortion-restrictive states report more challenges in accessing the procedure. The data underscores the divide between public opinion and state-level restrictions, particularly in GOP-controlled states.","['US', 'AP', 'NORC', 'AP', 'U', 'S', 'AP', 'Israel', 'Hamas War Russia - Ukraine War', 'Asia', 'Pacific', 'Latin', 'America', 'Europe Africa Middle East', 'China Australia Joe', '##iden Congress', 'Madness MLB NBA NHL NFL Soccer Golf Tennis AP', 'Markets', 'Associated Press', 'AP', 'AP', 'Associated Press', 'AP', 'AP', 'Associated Press', 'Israel', 'Unilever', 'Elon Musk', 'US', 'AP', 'NORC', 'U', 'S', 'Associated Press', 'NORC Center for Public Affairs Research', 'GEOFF MULVIHILL', 'L', '##LE', 'SAND', '##S S', 'Co', 'Em', 'Facebook X Reddit', '##I', 'Pi', 'U', 'S', 'Associated Press', 'NORC Center', 'Affairs Research', 'U', 'S', 'Court', 'Roe', 'Wade']","A recent AP-NORC poll reveals that most U.S. adults, even in states with strict abortion laws, believe abortion should be permitted in early pregnancy stages. Conducted a year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the survey shows that two-thirds of Americans support abortion being generally legal, although only a minority (about 25%) believe it should always be legal, while around 10% think it should be completely illegal.

The study highlights that support for access diminishes as pregnancy progresses: 73% favor access at six weeks, and about half at 15 weeks, but only around a third believe it should be available at 24 weeks. People in restrictive states are more likely to feel abortion access is too difficult, with this view more common among women, Democrats, and independents than among Republicans.

The poll reflects ongoing complexities in public opinion on abortion, as legislative efforts in several states continue to either tighten or clarify abortion restrictions.",C,

Wade was overturned, most adults still believe that abortion should be legal and most are in favor of Congress guaranteeing access to legal abortion. Topline Results Public Use Files Methodology July, 12, 2023 A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, most adults still believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and most are in favor of Congress passing a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion. This is similar to the results of an AP-NORC poll conducted July 2022 when Roe v. Wade was first overturned. Opinions are more divided over the timeframe of when abortion should be allowed. Seventy-three percent of respondents think that it should be allowed within the first 6 weeks, but that drops to 51 for 15 weeks. Most people living in states where abortion is highly restricted say it should be legal at least up to six weeks, even as they generally favor tighter access to abortion than adults overall. Most adults believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, consistent with a July 2022 poll. And 60 of the public think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. However, a partisan divide persists. Most Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while most Republicans think it should be illegal in most or all cases. Similarly, 84 of Democrats support a federal law ensuring access to the procedure, compared to just 32 of Republicans. Democrats are more supportive of legal abortion than Republicans regardless of religion. Among Catholics, 85 of Democrats believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared to 39 of Republicans. People living in states with the most restrictive abortion laws are less likely than those living in states where abortion is broadly available to say abortion should usually be legal, 53 vs 70. Still, even in those most restrictive states, only 14 say abortion should always be illegal. And while most people believe that their state should allow legal abortion 6 weeks into pregnancy, opinions are more divided later into pregnancy. About half of adults say states should allow legal abortions at 15 weeks, and just 27 say the same at 24 weeks into a pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of those living in states with the most restrictive abortion laws people say abortion should be allowed at six weeks along with more than 7 in 10 people in the rest of the country. At 15 weeks, 59 of those living in the least restrictive states say it should be legal compared with about 4 in 10 people in more restrictive states. Only 31 of people living in states where abortion is broadly available say the procedure should be legal at 24 weeks as well as about one in four residents of states with at least some restrictions. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans believe that a pregnant person should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion in certain circumstances, including if the child would be born with a life-threatening illness, the pregnant persons own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy, or the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. And majorities of born-again Christians and Catholics agree that a pregnant person should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion if the pregnant persons own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy or if the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. But if a person does not want to be pregnant for any reason, just 29 of Republicans believe they should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion compared to 79 Democrats. These opinions have remained relatively consistent since AP-NORC last asked these questions in July 2022. Most adults know someone who has had an abortion, including 63 of Democrats and 53 of Republicans. Despite the overturning of Roe v. Wade, few Americans know someone who has been unable to get an abortion 7 or who had to travel to another state to do so 7 in the last year. The public is divided about how easy it is to access abortion in their community. Thirty-nine percent think it is too difficult, 24 think it is too easy, and 32 think it is about right. About half of adults say access is about right when it comes to family planning services and birth control and prenatal care, while 28 say it is too difficult to access these services. People living in states with highly restrictive abortion policies are somewhat more likely to say its too difficult than people in states where abortion is broadly available, 44 to 36, even though people in these states generally favor more restrictions on abortion. Overall, 39 of adults approve of how President Biden is handling abortion policy, including 61 of Democrats and just 18 of Republicans. States where most abortions are illegal at all stages of pregnancy with few exceptions include Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Abortion is illegal after about six to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah. And states where abortion is legal at least until 22 weeks include Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. The nationwide poll was conducted June 22-26, 2023 using the AmeriSpeak Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,220 adults. The margin of sampling error is - 3.9 percentage points.

The Associated Press and NORC.","A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a majority of Americans continue to support legal abortion, although opinions vary on the specifics. According to an AP-NORC poll from June 2023, most adults believe abortion should remain legal in all or most cases, with 60% advocating for a federal law to guarantee abortion access nationwide. However, views on the timing of abortion are divided. While 73% think abortion should be legal within the first six weeks of pregnancy, that support drops to 51% at 15 weeks, and only 27% support it at 24 weeks.

Political party affiliation heavily influences views: most Democrats support broad access to abortion and a federal law to protect it, while Republicans tend to favor restrictions or complete bans. This divide also extends to religious groups, with Democrats more likely than Republicans, even among Catholics, to support legal abortion. People in states with more restrictive abortion laws are more likely to support limitations but still generally favor abortion at least up to six weeks.

Public opinion also reflects support for abortion in specific circumstances, such as when a pregnancy poses a risk to the person’s health or results from rape or incest. However, only 29% of Republicans support abortion for any reason, compared to 79% of Democrats. Despite the legal changes, the majority of Americans still know someone who has had an abortion, though fewer know someone who faced barriers to obtaining one.

While public views are mixed on how easy it is to access abortion, with 39% stating it is too difficult, there is significant concern over access to family planning and prenatal care, especially in states with restrictive policies. In terms of the current political climate, 39% of adults approve of President Biden’s handling of abortion policy, with notable partisan differences.

The poll highlights that while the country remains divided over abortion access, most Americans support some form of legal abortion, with significant regional, political, and personal circumstances influencing opinions.","['Americans', 'AP', 'NORC', 'NORC', 'Ethnic', 'Americans', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Congress', 'Supreme Court', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Congress', 'NORC', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Congress', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Catholics', 'Democrats', 'Republicans']","According to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June 2023, a year after the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, most Americans continue to support legal abortion with certain restrictions. The study reveals that a majority favor Congressional action to protect abortion rights, although opinions on the timing of permitted abortions vary. While 73% support abortion access within the first six weeks of pregnancy, this drops to 51% by 15 weeks. Support for abortion access is significantly higher in states with fewer restrictions compared to those with stricter laws.

A sharp partisan divide persists, with most Democrats supporting legal abortion in most cases and a national law ensuring access, while most Republicans oppose it. For example, 84% of Democrats favor federal protections, compared to only 32% of Republicans. Views on abortion are also influenced by religious affiliation; 85% of Democratic Catholics support legal abortion in most cases, whereas only 39% of Republican Catholics agree.

In cases where the pregnancy poses a life-threatening risk to the mother or results from rape or incest, both Democrats and Republicans generally support abortion rights. However, if the reason for abortion is non-specific (e.g., simply not wanting the pregnancy), only 29% of Republicans support it, compared to 79% of Democrats. Despite the legislative changes, few Americans report knowing someone who has been denied an abortion or had to travel to access one.

The study further indicates that public opinion is mixed on abortion access in their communities, with 39% finding it too difficult, 24% too easy, and 32% feeling it is adequate. Access to related family planning services is generally rated as satisfactory, although those in restrictive states are more likely to say it is too limited. President Biden’s handling of abortion policy has 39% approval, with support primarily among Democrats.

The poll, based on responses from 1,220 adults, highlights regional differences in abortion laws: in some states, abortion is prohibited at all stages, while others permit it up to 22 weeks. The margin of error for the poll is ±3.9 percentage points.",L,

Photo Allyson Escobar WASHINGTON With a handmade sign Im smiling because my birthmother chose life! and a big smile on her face, Natanya Stark, 18, proudly walked with her family during the annual national March for Life on Jan. 24 in Washington. I find the pro-life movement very compelling. My birth mother was very young when she had me, and I was very inspired by her courage, Natanya, the adopted daughter of Adam and Marisa Stark, said. I wanted to show people my activism, and to talk about supporting adoptions, because I have a lot of siblings who are also adopted. I want to spread the word that adoption is an option and the best thing to do. The Starks, who live in Pound Ridge in Westchester County, have seven children, six of them adopted, including three from China. The familys story shows another facet of the pro-life movement adoption. Its very important for them to see that there are lots of people who share our beliefs and to know theyre not alone, said Adam Stark, the father, whos a real estate manager. Going to the March for Life was very important for our kids, especially for our kids who are adopted and even our biological son. Its the whole idea that there are no unwanted children. There are always families these children belong to. Over the course of almost 15 years, the Starks, who are Jewish, adopted three children from the United States Natanya, David and Maya and then three from China Jessica, Ella and Celia. Adam Stark, who married his wife, Marisa, in 1998, said the couple just always knew that they would adopt. We wanted to create a big, special family, and its the best thing weve ever done. We have the means to give a child in need a family. I wouldnt have done it any different way. To benefit from having that child as part of your family, its created a very special dynamic for us, he said. My children wouldnt be here if their birth mother decided against life. Marisa Stark Natanya, their first child, was adopted from an agency the couple found in Kansas. After doing the routine paperwork and social worker home study, they were paired with the birth mother, a teenager who wasnt able to support her baby but who wanted the child to grow up with a good life and a good family, Adam said. Adam and Marisa flew to Kansas and met Natanya on the night she was born Jan. 21, 2002. Adam remembers the very first time he held his adopted daughter, and later taking her home to New York. She was very tiny, he recalls. She was the smallest baby ever on that plane. The Starks knew that they wanted their child to have siblings of her own to play with, and in 2004, with the help of another agency, they brought home twins from Texas David and Maya, who are now 15. Ella, David, Celia, Natanya, Zachary, Jessica, Maya, and Marisa Stark at their home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. Photo courtesy of Marisa Stark In April 2007, their biological son, Zachary, was born, but for Marisa, four wasnt enough. She read articles about foster care and learned about abandoned children in orphanages in need of homes, especially in China. She saw a photo of Jessica, who was burned as a child and was only a couple of months younger than Natanya. The process of international adoption took about 13 frightening months, Marisa says. By the time the Starks completed the paperwork, Jessica was already seven years old when she came to live with the family in 2009. There was this little girl on the other side of the world stuck in an orphanage I was beside myself because of all the quarantines and delays, Marisa said. But we brought her home, and I remember Natanya ran up to Jessica screaming, Jessie, Ive been waiting for you my whole life! She was so happy to have a sister her own age. After Jessica, whom the parents describe as the easy, artistic one, the Starks wanted to continue to add to their family. A little over a year later, in 2010, Natanya and Marisa went back to China to pick up their fifth toddler, Ella, who was born with one eye. Then five years later, Celia came along after the Starks participated in a Chinese government-led temporary host family adoptee program. Under the program, Celia went to live with the Starks in late 2015 for four weeks. She had cerebral palsy and the biggest grin wed ever seen, Marisa said. We always called her Ms. Happy. Natanya Stark attended her first March For Life in Washington D.C. on Jan. 24. She says she was excited to see young people her age marching for the cause. Photo Allyson Escobar Marisa described Celia as the sweetest, happiest, most cheerful kid in the whole world Adam and I and the kids knew, we couldnt let her go. They went through the adoption process once more and brought Celia, then 9, home in late 2016. Now 12 years old, she is enrolled in a special education program. She has certain developmental challenges, but everyone knows and loves her, Adam says. Celia lights up a room. My kids are all so different, and its so nice to be a part of that, Marisa says. One day I can be in the theater with Maya, to watching debates with Zachary, or cheering David at cross-country meets. Or Jessica, who came into the States not speaking any English, and now shes a top student and into photography. My children wouldnt be here if their birth mother decided against life. All of them understand that, she said. Tags adoption, Catholic News, March for Life, New York, pro-life Login here to comment with a friend.

Natanya Stark, adopted at birth, attended the 2020 March for Life in Washington, D.C., to advocate for adoption, sharing her belief that it is the best choice for children born into difficult circumstances. The Stark family, from Pound Ridge, New York, has seven children, six of whom are adopted, including three from China. They are committed to spreading the message that adoption is a loving alternative to abortion and that no child is unwanted.

Adam and Marisa Stark, both of whom are Jewish, decided to build a large family through adoption early in their marriage. Their first child, Natanya, was adopted from Kansas in 2002, followed by twins David and Maya in 2004. The couple then had a biological son, Zachary, in 2007, and later adopted children from China: Jessica, Ella, and Celia, with Celia having special needs.

The Starks’ story demonstrates the positive impact of adoption, emphasizing how their children’s lives have been enriched by their adoption experiences. Marisa Stark also highlights how the family’s diverse experiences, such as Jessica’s success despite language barriers and Celia’s joy despite developmental challenges, prove that every child has a place in a family. The family’s story serves as a powerful testament to the value of life and the transformative power of adoption.","['Life', 'Tablet', 'Policy', 'Table', '##oc', 'News New York News National News International', '##w New York News', 'Life', 'Allyson Escobar Zachary', 'Adam', 'Natanya Stark', 'March For Life 2020', 'Washington D', 'C', 'Allyson Escobar', 'Natanya Stark', 'March for Life', 'Washington', 'Natanya', 'Adam', 'Marisa Stark', 'Stark', 'Pound Ridge', 'Westchester County', 'China', 'Adam Stark', 'Stark', 'Jewish', 'United States', 'Nat', 'David', 'Maya', 'China']","In a feature by The Tablet, the story of the Stark family highlights their journey of adoption as a significant part of their pro-life commitment. The Starks, a Jewish family from Pound Ridge, Westchester County, New York, have seven children, six of whom are adopted, three from China and three from the United States. Their story is closely linked to the pro-life movement, as they emphasize that adoption offers a positive alternative for children in need of homes. Natanya Stark, their eldest adopted child, has been particularly inspired by her birth mother’s decision to carry her to term. At the 2020 March for Life in Washington, D.C., she advocated for adoption with a sign that read, “I’m smiling because my birthmother chose life!” expressing gratitude for her birth mother’s courage and the love of her adoptive family.

The Starks’ adoption journey began in 2002 with Natanya, followed by David and Maya, twins from Texas. In 2007, the family’s only biological child, Zachary, was born, after which Marisa Stark was moved by stories of children in need and began looking into international adoption. Jessica, a burn survivor from China, joined the family in 2009, followed by Ella in 2010, and finally Celia, who has cerebral palsy, in 2016. Celia initially joined them through a temporary hosting program led by the Chinese government, but the family soon decided to adopt her permanently.

Each child brings unique qualities and challenges, enriching the family dynamic. Jessica has developed a passion for photography, Maya is involved in theater, Zachary debates, and David participates in cross-country running. Despite their diverse backgrounds and talents, the family unites around the pro-life philosophy that every child deserves a loving family. Marisa Stark reflected on the joy of parenthood, saying that each child’s life was made possible because their birth mothers chose adoption, underscoring the family’s mission to advocate for adoption as a life-affirming choice.",R,

Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion, handing a victory to abortion-rights supporters who have seen access to the procedure eroded by Republican lawmakers in the deeply red state. The outcome of the election that concluded Tuesday highlighted what appeared to be a gap between voter sentiment and the expectations of Kentuckys GOP-dominated legislature, which imposed a near-total ban on abortions and put the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. While a significant moral victory for abortion-rights advocates, the amendments defeat will have no practical impact on the right to an abortion if a sweeping ban on the procedure approved by lawmakers survives a legal challenge presently before the state Supreme Court. Still, the amendments rejection leaves open the possibility that abortion could be declared a state right by the court. Rachel Sweet of Protect Kentucky Access, an abortion-rights coalition, hailed the outcome as a historic win against government overreach into the personal medical decisions of Kentuckians. The people of Kentucky have spoken and their answer is no - no to extremist politicians banning abortion and making private medical decisions on their behalf, said Amber Duke, interim executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky.

Abortion-rights supporters who suffered years of setbacks in Kentuckys legislature were jubilant, but said considerably more work is ahead in their quest to restore access to the procedure. The Family Foundation, a faith-based organization opposed to abortion, said Wednesday that the fight for the unborn will continue. While we are disappointed in the results of Amendment 2, the pro-life movement in Kentucky and across the nation, is steadfast in its resolve to continue defending life, David Walls, the groups executive director, said in a written statement. Kentuckys laws protecting preborn children remain in place and Kentuckians have returned large, pro-life legislative majorities to the General Assembly. The Kentucky ballot question had asked voters if they wanted to amend the constitution to say To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion. A year ago, lawmakers had added the proposed amendment to the 2022 general election slate in a move some thought would drive more conservative voters to the polls at a time before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June overturning Roe v. Wade. Since then, voters in Kansas have rejected a ballot measure that would have changed that states constitution to let lawmakers tighten restrictions or ban abortions. Kentucky was among a handful of states with abortion referendums on the ballot this fall. The Kentucky Supreme Court has a hearing next week on challenges by the states two remaining abortion clinics to the near-total abortion ban approved by lawmakers. The high court ruled this summer that the ban would stay in place while it reviewed the challenges. Abortion-related court battles have been frequent and fierce in Kentucky since Republicans took full control of the legislature after the 2016 election. Lawmakers enacted a series of laws adding restrictions and requirements for those seeking to end their pregnancies. Fervor ran high on both sides during the campaign, as donations poured in, politicians spoke out, volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and advocates accused the opposition of misleading voters. The legislature previously enacted a so-called trigger law banning nearly all abortions if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The only instances when abortions are currently allowed in Kentucky are to save a pregnant womans life or to prevent disabling injury. There are no exceptions for rape or incest victims. Pointing to the extremely narrow exceptions, abortion-rights supporters said the legislatures hardline stand on abortion made constitutional protections necessary. Abortion opponents, in pushing for the amendment, said it would have ensured abortion policy comes from the legislature where they say it belongs and not from the courts.

Support for NewsHour Provided By","In November 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at removing protections for abortion rights, marking a significant victory for abortion-rights advocates. This amendment would have prevented the state constitution from securing or protecting a right to abortion. Despite this defeat, the rejection of the amendment does not immediately alter the legal status of abortion in the state, as a near-total abortion ban, approved by the Kentucky legislature, is under review by the state’s Supreme Court. The court’s ruling on the ban is expected to have a greater practical impact on abortion access.

The outcome reflects a divide between Kentucky’s voters and its Republican-dominated legislature, which has enacted restrictive abortion laws in recent years. The amendment’s defeat was celebrated by abortion-rights groups like Protect Kentucky Access and the ACLU, who framed it as a rejection of government interference in personal medical decisions. On the other hand, pro-life organizations like the Family Foundation expressed disappointment but reiterated their commitment to defending anti-abortion policies.

The proposed amendment was part of a broader trend of state-level referendums on abortion, following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. While abortion access in Kentucky remains severely restricted—only permitted to save the life of the mother or prevent disabling injury, with no exceptions for rape or incest—the voters’ decision leaves open the possibility for future legal protections for abortion. The Kentucky Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on the state’s abortion ban could further shape the future of abortion rights in the state.","['Kentucky', 'PBS NewsHour', 'PBS News', 'and Cape', '##hart', 'Supreme Court Arts', 'Race', 'Paul Sol', 'PBS NewsHour', 'Bruce Schreiner', 'Associated Press', 'Beth Campbell', 'Associated Press', 'Pinter', 'Kentucky', 'LOUISVILLE', 'Ky', 'Kentucky', 'Republican', 'Kentucky', 'GOP', 'Supreme Court', 'Rachel', 'Kentucky', 'Kent', 'Kentucky', 'Duke', 'AC', 'Kentucky']","In a recent Kentucky election, voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at eliminating protections for abortion rights. This outcome represents a notable win for abortion-rights advocates in a state that has faced restrictive laws imposed by its GOP-dominated legislature. The amendment’s defeat highlights a disconnect between the state’s voter base and the conservative legislative agenda, which has pushed for a near-total abortion ban.

Though the amendment’s rejection does not directly impact existing abortion laws, it leaves open the possibility that Kentucky’s Supreme Court could later recognize abortion as a constitutional right within the state. Rachel Sweet of Protect Kentucky Access, an abortion-rights coalition, celebrated the result as a significant step against governmental interference in personal medical decisions. Similarly, Amber Duke from the ACLU of Kentucky viewed the result as a rejection of extreme anti-abortion legislation.

In contrast, David Walls of the Family Foundation, a pro-life organization, expressed disappointment but reaffirmed the group’s commitment to advancing anti-abortion policies. He emphasized that pro-life advocates in Kentucky remain influential, with large legislative majorities supporting their cause.

The ballot question, which asked voters if the state constitution should explicitly deny abortion rights, was introduced by lawmakers in hopes of galvanizing conservative voters. This came before the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, a ruling that removed federal protections for abortion and activated Kentucky’s existing “trigger law,” which bans nearly all abortions except in cases where the pregnant person’s life is at risk.

Kentucky’s ballot measure was one of several abortion-related referendums across the country. In Kansas, a similar proposal to allow legislative abortion restrictions was also rejected by voters, indicating a trend where voters in traditionally conservative states are pushing back against restrictive abortion laws. Kentucky’s Supreme Court is set to review legal challenges to the state’s abortion ban, which has intensified efforts on both sides to sway public opinion and shape abortion policy.",L,

Kleinfelds lawyers had determined that the mandate included medication abortions, which are administered by pillthe kind that Kleinfeld offered at her clinic.Kleinfeld went to each of her patients, one by one, that morning and explained that she would have to cancel their appointments. They were distraught, upset, angry, saddened, confused, panic stricken, Kleinfeld remembers. Every single woman was planning to proceed with her decision in whatever way was necessary, she adds. Now, just at greater risk and compounding the health crises with more health risks.But if the decision was personally disruptive for Kleinfelds patients, Texass sweeping order was also an early sign of a soon-to-be explosive battle against abortion providers nationwide. On April 7, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas ban on abortions could stand, potentially triggering a petition to the Supreme Court.Planned Parenthood, which along with the Center for Reproductive Rights and other lawyers had sued Texas on behalf of a group of abortion providers, said earlier in the day on April 7 that if the Fifth Circuit did not rule, they planned to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Alexis McGill Johnson, the groups acting president, said on Twitter after the Fifth Circuit ruling Tuesday afternoon, that they would push forward.We wont let this injustice stand. Our patients deserve better, McGill Johnson wrote.The fight in Texas is just one of many battles nationwide. Five other Republican-led statesOhio, Texas, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahomahave taken similar steps to temporarily ban abortions during the coronavirus outbreak. While all of those have been challenged in court, more conservative states are considering following suit.Reproductive rights advocates are used to fighting state laws and court battles to preserve abortion access. But this is different. By using executive orders and other emergency measures, a handful of governors and state attorneys general have managed, at least temporarily, to all but shut down legal abortions. Abortion providers say these new restrictions will likely have lasting impacts, not only on the patients in search of abortions, but also on independent abortion clinics ability to survive financially in the months ahead.The challenges that independent clinics and their patients have had to contend with have not disappeared. Medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion raised enormous barriers before the pandemic and those barriers are becoming increasingly insurmountable now, said Jay Thibodeau, communications director for the Abortion Care Network, a national group for independent abortion providers.Independent clinics provide the majority of abortions in the United States. They often have small staffs, run on tight budgets and are constantly navigating new restrictions on the way they can provide services to their patients. While the increasing number of abortion regulations in recent years has led many clinics around the country to close, every state has maintained at least one abortion provider. Now the COVID-19 pandemic is testing that reality.Its going to strain any nonprofit small business who works near the margins, Dr. Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director at the Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa City, says of states banning abortions during the pandemic. Some of these clinics have found emergency relief. Abortion providers, represented by lawyers and reproductive rights groups, have sued and won temporary injunctions in Ohio, Alabama and Oklahoma, and come to an agreement with Iowa. Theyve argued that abortion is time-sensitive, essential health care, a position supported by seven national medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But nearly all abortions remain banned in Texas, and officials in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia have questioned whether abortions should be allowed to continue in those states as well. Eighteen other states have also joined briefs supporting Texas in its fight.Hundreds of laws placing restrictions on abortion access have been passed over the last decade, and 2019 saw a particularly large wave of legislation seeking to curtail abortions across the country. These laws have an overwhelming chilling effect. Even in cases where reproductive rights advocates ultimately win in court, providers or patients feel the consequences. For example, in 2016, the Supreme Court sided with abortion providers in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, striking down regulations in Texas HB 2 law, which required all abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and clinics to be equipped with hospital-level surgical centers. But the court ruling came too late for many providers. We certainly saw after HB 2, when half the clinics closed, we went from 42 clinics to 21 virtually overnight, says Dr. Robin Wallace, co-medical director at Southwestern Womens Surgery Center in Dallas. And then with the favorable Supreme Court ruling in 2016, only a handful of clinics reopened. We did not see a rebound in terms of access. In addition to finding an abortion provider, patients must now worry about whether they are going to spread, or contract, COVID-19, Wallace notes. They are not only being turned away from the health care that they would normally be able to access in their home state, she says, but now theyre having to grapple with this decision of, do I violate this stay at home guideline in order to seek my abortion?In Texas, patients have had to travel particularly far from home. Nearly half of the states 254 counties were 100 miles from the nearest U.S. abortion provider before the COVID-19 order, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin. With all Texas clinics now blocked from offering abortion, 94 of the states counties are more than 100 miles from a provider, and nearly three quarters are more than 200 miles away.And the situation isnt great for abortion providers going forward, Wallace adds. While Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and other abortion providers continue to pursue legal action, the current ruling has allowed Abbotts order stopping abortions, which currently lasts through April 21, to stand. That amount of time not being able to provide care absolutely could be financially devastating and result in more clinic closures across the state, Wallace says.In Oklahoma, the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma city was facing similar conditions until April 6 when a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the states abortion ban. In the first week that Oklahomas order stopped abortions, Trust Women had to cancel about 160 appointments, according to Julie Burkhart, its CEO and founder. Most of her staff was already working remotely, and she had started to think about what would happen if the clinic had to stay closed for longer. That would absolutely impact us financially, Burkart said in an interview on March 31. Within the month I would really have to sit down and make some tough decisions.The courts decision on April 6 will let Trust Women to start providing some abortions again, but not all procedures are allowed and the picture could change. Its a huge relief that we can start seeing patients again, at least for now, Burkhart said on April 6. We hope the court will keep the ban blocked so our patients arent forced to travel to other states to find abortion care at a time when travel is risky and discouraged.COVID-19 has brought up other concerns for abortion providers, too. In Iowa, where Hardy-Fairbanks says shes grateful that her states agreement now allows her to make case-by-case determinations and provide abortions in compliance with the governors order, the clinic has had to cut back in other ways.The coronavirus in general has had a big impact, she says. Were a healthcare clinic. We do trans care and contraception care and well visits, and all of those kinds of visits we definitely cant do right now because they need to be delayed in order to allow people to stay home and to conserve our resources. Those restrictions create complications for patients who need that care, but providers say they were making those tough choices and taking COVID-19 precautions on their own before states stepped in. As family planning specialists, we were already acutely aware that an appropriate public health response was going to include some limitations on how other health care services continued during the crisis, Wallace says.Weeks before the Texas order to stop providing abortions, Wallace says her clinic was in touch with local health officials and had started screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms, practicing social distancing and limiting the number of people in the clinic. All the abortion providers who spoke with TIME said they had previously added these elements, as well as other measures including staggering appointment times, increasing cleaning and cutting back on other services.As abortion providers face destabilizing conditions, its unclear whether they will be able to access government relief funding the way other medical providers and nonprofits will be able to do. The CARES Act stimulus package gives President Trumps Small Business Administration the leeway to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, and the final law also includes Hyde Amendment-like language, which experts say prevents state and local governments from using COVID-19 funds to help abortion services. Several providers told TIME that they were unsure if they would be able to keep their staffs paid and protected during this time. Ive been working in Texas for seven and a half years now and have weathered the storms of HB 2 and other threats to access over time. And this by far is the most painful, Wallace says. When you layer this restriction of necessary health care on top of the publics concerns about the unknown of their future well being, it is just really beyond tragic. It was devastating.More Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?

This amendment would have blocked the state constitution from guaranteeing a right to abortion. However, the outcome does not immediately affect abortion legality, as a near-total abortion ban passed by the legislature is currently under review by the Kentucky Supreme Court, with its decision expected to have a more significant impact on abortion access.

The vote outcome highlights a divide between Kentucky voters and the Republican-controlled legislature, which has passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years. Abortion-rights groups, like Protect Kentucky Access and the ACLU, celebrated the vote as a victory against government interference in medical decisions. In contrast, pro-life organizations such as the Family Foundation expressed disappointment but vowed to continue advocating for anti-abortion policies.

The amendment was part of a broader wave of state referendums on abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. While abortion access in Kentucky remains extremely limited—only allowed to save the life of the mother or prevent serious injury, with no exceptions for rape or incest—the voters’ rejection of the amendment leaves the door open for future legal protections. The Kentucky Supreme Court’s forthcoming ruling on the state’s abortion ban will further influence the future of abortion rights in Kentucky.","['S', '##TI', 'TIM', 'TIM', '##IM', 'Care', 'CanadaG', '##bal Help Center', ""Whole Woman ' s Health"", 'San Antonio', 'Texas', 'Matthew Busch', 'Abigail Abrams', 'Klein', '##feld', 'Houston', 'Texas', 'Klein', 'Klein']","In April 2020, a TIME article by Abigail Abrams reported on the impact of COVID-19 on abortion access in the U.S., focusing on states that temporarily banned abortions during the pandemic, claiming them as non-essential procedures. Kathy Kleinfeld, of Houston Women’s Reproductive Services, was forced to cancel appointments after Texas Attorney General classified abortion as a non-essential service, heightening the already strained access to reproductive care. This decision reflected a growing trend, with states like Ohio, Alabama, and Oklahoma issuing similar restrictions. Legal battles quickly ensued, with Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights challenging these bans in court, arguing that abortion is essential, time-sensitive healthcare.

These restrictions placed significant pressures on independent abortion clinics, which already operated on limited budgets and faced existing legal obstacles. Many clinics faced financial uncertainty, as prolonged closures threatened their sustainability. Notably, the Fifth Circuit Court upheld Texas’ ban, leading to a potential escalation to the Supreme Court.

Experts and abortion advocates, including Jay Thibodeau of the Abortion Care Network, warned that the new restrictions could have lasting consequences, not only for patients but also for the survival of independent clinics, which provide the majority of abortions nationwide. Clinics like the Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa managed to secure temporary injunctions allowing limited abortion services to resume, but access was still significantly curtailed.

The closures forced patients to travel further distances, increasing health risks during the pandemic and further straining healthcare resources. For instance, 94 Texas counties became over 100 miles away from the nearest abortion provider after the state’s restrictions, with three-quarters of counties over 200 miles away. These measures compounded the health risks and logistical burdens on patients needing urgent reproductive care.

Financial support for clinics remained uncertain. The federal CARES Act stimulus package contained provisions allowing the denial of funds to Planned Parenthood and restricted funds from supporting abortion services. As clinics struggled to maintain operations, staff, and safety during the pandemic, many feared that they would not qualify for the relief granted to other medical providers. Dr. Robin Wallace of the Southwestern Women’s Surgery Center described the experience as the most challenging to date, exacerbating concerns over access to essential health services amidst a public health crisis.",L,

Credit CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS The steps of the Supreme Court are a popular place to be when abortion rights are at stake. On Wednesday morning, actresses Elizabeth Banks and Busy Philipps showed up there to headline a rally attended by abortion rights activists. They were joined by liberal Congresswomen, including Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Barbara Lee of California. Abortion rights opponents gathered on the steps in protest as well. Inside the court, the justices heard oral arguments in June Medical Services v. Russo, a case that will determine the fate of abortion access in Louisiana and has the potential to undermine abortion rights across the United States. Banks, who most recently directed the Charlie's Angels reboot, and Philipps, formerly the host of Busy Tonight, are members of the Center for Reproductive Rights Creative Council, an initiative meant to harness Hollywood's influence to advocate for sexual reproductive health and rights. Lawyers from the Center for Reproductive Rights, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization, presented arguments to the Supreme Court, asking the nine justices to strike down a law in Louisiana that would ostensibly shutter all but one abortion clinic and leave an estimated 10,000 women who seek abortion annually in the state with access to a single doctor. In 2016, the Supreme Court found the same law, when implemented in Texas, unconstitutional. ""Today we are taking the opportunity to present reproductive freedom, including abortion, for exactly what it is no less than liberty itself,"" Banks said. SEE ALSO Inside the abortion clinic where no one whispers, no one shames For Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO and founder of the abortion provider Whole Woman's Health, the case feels like a ""time warp."" Nearly four years ago, Hagstrom Miller challenged Texas' law and descended triumphantly down the Supreme Court steps when the justices struck it down in a 5-3 ruling for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The victory created a new standard for states hoping to pass abortion restrictions Legislators had to demonstrate with clear, fact-based evidence that regulations protect women's health and do not pose an undue burden on patients. Previously, lawmakers could merely assert they were acting on behalf of women's health and safety without providing compelling evidence to back that up. The decision was the first in decades to fundamentally strengthen abortion rights.""Some days I feel like, wait we already did this, we already proved this, and the court ruled in our favor,"" says Hagstrom Miller. ""But look, theyve been trying to unravel Roe v. Wade for pretty much my whole life time. I cant be surprised."" Tweet may have been deleted At issue then and now is whether it's constitutional for states to require physicians who work at abortion clinics to obtain hospital admitting privileges. Advocates of the law say the regulation safeguards a woman's health in the event that she needs to be admitted to the hospital following an abortion procedure. Opponents argue that abortion-related hospital admissions are exceedingly rare and that the process for getting privileges is often unpredictable and onerous. Hospitals don't need to respond to every request and may not explain why they've rejected applications. They might dismiss an application because they don't want to be affiliated with an abortion provider, or because they know abortion-related admissions are rare and therefore a physician won't be a reliable source of income. Some clinics in Texas that were subject to admitting-privileges regulations prior to the Supreme Court decision closed because they could not comply with the law. The Center for Reproductive Rights expects the same to happen in Louisiana if Act 620 goes into effect. The law will effectively shutter two of the three abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving one physician who already has admitting privileges to provide abortion care to thousands of women who seek them in the state each year, creating a clear undue burden on patients. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry says the restriction would not close clinics. The law, which passed in 2014, reached the Supreme Court because the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a district court finding that the law was unconstitutional. Landry has argued that the legislation is significantly different than Texas' bill because, among other things, it didn't impose criminal penalties on providers. The Supreme Court will now potentially uphold its previous decision, or narrow its finding, which would weaken Whole Woman's Health. Reversing or watering down that decision would undermine abortion rights by opening the floodgates for new legislation designed to restrict abortion access under the guise of ensuring women's health and safety. Should the majority choose to overturn the decision, it will erase the victory advocates claimed in 2016. ""Some of those justices would like for Whole Woman's Health to not have happened in the first place,"" says Hagstrom Miller. ""Now that it is precedent, how will they apply it? Will they narrow the scope in some way? Those are the things I dwell on and think are likely."" In addition to taking up admitting privileges again, the Supreme Court will also consider whether abortion providers can challenge state restrictions as a third party. June Medical Services is the corporate name of Hope Clinic, a provider in Shreveport, Louisiana, that sued the state to stop the implementation of Act 620. While legal rulings over the past 50 years have held that providers can sue on behalf of their patients' constitutional rights, lawyers representing the state of Louisiana have argued that providers don't share a close relationship with their patients and that their interests compete with those of their patients. ""It's bullying for really powerful people to say, 'You can't have your rights unless you stand up and speak in front of us.'"" If the Supreme Court agrees, it could prevent providers from making legal challenges and effectively force patients to file their own lawsuits. An amici brief filed by Whole Woman's Health lays out a compelling case for why patients wouldn't or couldn't pursue a complex and expensive legal strategy, including the ""profound stigma"" of seeking an abortion and the ""personal struggles"" many women endure during that time. ""If providers such as Amici are no longer permitted to enforce the constitutional rights of their patients, those patients voices will likely go unheard and their rights un-vindicated,"" the brief argues. Hagstrom Miller describes asking a pregnant person to bring a lawsuit on behalf of themselves as ""ridiculous"" and ""cruel."" Doing so, she says, would require significant personal and financial resources, surrendering confidentiality, and subjecting oneself to public scrutiny and shame. ""We've endured all of these things as an organization and we barely made it through,"" says Hagstrom Miller. ""It's bullying for really powerful people to say, 'You can't have your rights unless you stand up and speak in front of us.'"" Following the oral arguments in June Medical Services, the justices will spend the next few months formulating and writing its decision. Its ruling is expected to come this summer.

Russo, a case challenging Louisiana’s abortion laws. These laws could close most of the state’s abortion clinics, leaving only one physician to serve thousands of women. The rally, joined by other activists and lawmakers, focused on preventing the law, which mirrors a Texas law previously ruled unconstitutional by the Court in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016).

Banks and Philipps, who are part of the Center for Reproductive Rights Creative Council, emphasize the importance of reproductive freedom as a fundamental liberty. The case revolves around a law that requires abortion providers in Louisiana to have hospital admitting privileges, which critics argue is an unnecessary and burdensome requirement that could force many clinics to close. This law, if upheld, would likely create a severe barrier to abortion access, particularly in a state with limited healthcare options for women.

The legal issue at hand is whether requiring admitting privileges for physicians is unconstitutional, as it places an undue burden on women’s access to abortion. Advocates point out that such regulations do not actually improve patient health, as abortion-related hospital admissions are rare. The outcome of this case could have national implications, potentially weakening or overturning previous Supreme Court rulings that protect abortion rights, including the 2016 ruling that strengthened the need for evidence-based regulations rather than just assertions about health safety.

Additionally, the case also explores whether abortion providers can challenge state laws on behalf of their patients, a decision that could significantly limit legal recourse for patients and providers alike. The outcome of this case, expected in the summer of 2020, will have profound consequences for abortion access in Louisiana and across the country.","['Elizabeth Banks', 'Busy Philipps', 'Supreme Court', '##ble', 'LGBT', '##ble', 'Apple', '##ble', 'VIDEOS Ma', '##ble', 'Elizabeth Banks', 'Busy Philipps', 'Supreme Court', 'U', 'S', 'Rebecca Ruiz', 'Elizabeth Banks', 'Supreme Court', 'Supreme Court', 'Elizabeth Banks', 'Busy Philipps', 'Congress', 'Rashida Tlaib', 'Michigan', 'Ayanna Pressley', 'Massachusetts', 'Barbara Lee', 'California', 'Russo', 'Louisiana', 'United', 'States', 'Banks', 'Charlie', 'Philipp', 'Center', 'Council', '##yers', 'Center', 'Rep']","Elizabeth Banks and Busy Philipps rallied in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on March 4, 2020, in support of abortion rights as part of a protest against Louisiana’s Act 620. This law requires physicians at abortion clinics to have hospital admitting privileges, a mandate critics argue imposes an undue burden on women seeking abortions, as it could result in the closure of two out of three abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving a single doctor to serve the state’s needs. Banks and Philipps, part of the Center for Reproductive Rights’ Creative Council, joined the rally along with Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, and Barbara Lee. The Center’s attorneys presented their case, arguing that the law is identical to a Texas law struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016 in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which established a precedent that abortion restrictions must be based on fact-based evidence showing they protect women’s health without imposing undue burdens.

Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, expressed frustration at revisiting issues settled in 2016, stating that opponents of abortion rights have continued to challenge Roe v. Wade. Supporters of Act 620 claim it ensures women’s safety, though critics highlight that abortion-related hospital admissions are rare and that the admitting privileges process is opaque, often resulting in refusals due to hospitals’ reluctance to associate with abortion services.

Additionally, the Supreme Court will determine whether abortion providers can challenge restrictive state laws on behalf of their patients, an established practice that allows providers to represent patients’ rights. If overturned, this change could prevent providers from legally challenging restrictive laws, requiring patients to represent themselves—a daunting and potentially stigmatizing process. The ruling on this case is expected in summer 2020 and could either uphold the 2016 decision or weaken its protections, potentially leading to increased abortion restrictions across the United States.",L,

Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.ArrowRightA week later, Leonard Leo, the head of the conservative Federalist Society and a McConnell ally, was sitting with the president-elect and his advisers in Trump Tower in New York with a list of six potential conservative nominees alphabetically typed onto a piece of personalized stationery, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions.AdvertisementAs incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trumps daughter, Ivanka, came in and out of the room, Leo laid out a road map for Trump on the federal court system, potentially transforming the foundational understanding of rights in America.It was a moment antiabortion activists had been working toward for decades The highest reaches of Republican power finally focused, in unison, on achieving the once implausible goal of revisiting the jurisprudence of the 1960s and 1970s, including Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.The leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion on abortion this past week showed that a majority of the court is now poised to do just that, with three of the five potential votes for overturning Roe coming from justices recommended by Leo, appointed by Trump and confirmed under the leadership of McConnell.AdvertisementFor the activists who have fought against enormous odds to elevate the issues of abortion and judicial selection, the sudden turnabout is nearly as shocking as Trumps election was for McConnell. Interviews with more than two dozen movement leaders, Republican officials and operatives describe a half-century journey that began to settle only over the last decade, as the politics of abortion finally polarized itself as a partisan issue and emerged as a top-tier Republican priority.An annotated Supreme Court draft opinion overturning Roe v. WadeI think even until earlier this week most pro-life leaders were holding their breath, said Charles Donovan, a former Reagan White House aide, who began working as legislative director for National Right to Life in the late 1970s. I do think its pretty stunning.Abortion rights advocates have also been stunned by the transformation, accusing Republicans of hijacking the courts for partisan and unpopular ends.AdvertisementThis is exactly what we feared was coming, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Womans Health, a network of abortion clinics. Republicans just do this and all the gloves are off.With almost no change in national public opinion over the past five decades, and as a majority of Americans remain opposed to overturning Roe, the movement succeeded by mobilizing a determined minority of Americans and adopting the protest tactics and sometimes the language of the left. They transformed religious interpretations of prenatal life, embraced medical advancements that gave new understanding of the fetus and helped to build an academic legal movement in the Ivy League universities that railed against the evolution of American jurisprudence.Most importantly, they nurtured a generation of political and legal leaders who saw in the setbacks of the 1970s to 1990s a defining cause. As a young man in the 1970s, McConnell, 80, had worked with the late Justice Antonin Scalia, an avowed opponent of Roe, in the Justice Department. A photograph of the two men from that time still hangs in McConnells office.AdvertisementIf I was looking at ways to have an impact on the country that I thought would be good and positive, this would be the way to do it, McConnell said in the interview this past week at his office on Capitol Hill.Majorities change. Taxes go up. Taxes go down, he continued. If you prefer America right of center, which I do, and youre looking around at what you can do to have the longest possible impact on the kind of America you want, it seems to me you look at the courts.The BeginningsReturn to menuAt the time Roe was handed down in 1973, political leaders had no such conception of the judiciary. Both parties viewed the law as a practice mostly astride of politics. Abortion was an issue without clear political or religious boundaries beyond the Catholic Church.The former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, W.A. Criswell, who ran the First Baptist Church in Dallas, had argued that a child became an individual only after birth when it had a life separate from its mother. In both 1971 and 1974, Southern Baptists passed resolutions asking evangelicals to work for legal abortion in cases of rape, incest and fetal deformity, as well as cases where there was carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental and physical health of the mother.That permissiveness among pastors was about to run headlong into a cultural rebellion against the liberal social movements of the 1960s. Womens libbers are promoting free sex instead of the slavery of marriage, the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly wrote in a 1972 essay opposing the Equal Rights Amendment. They are promoting abortions instead of families.A topic once only whispered about was now openly debated. People in the pews were hearing arguments for abortion explicitly for the first time and rejecting those arguments, said Russell Moore, the former head of the Southern Baptist Conventions public policy arm. They did understand that when they were pregnant and when they were expecting their child, it was their child.AdvertisementRepublican election strategists had simultaneously identified the issue as a cleave to peel away Democratic Catholics and Southern Whites unsettled by social change. During the 1972 election, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott R-Pa. seized upon the new culture war message, denouncing Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern as the Triple-A Candidate Acid, Abortion and Amnesty.So began a three-decade transformation inside the Republican Party, marked by small victories and massive disappointments for the antiabortion cause. At the 1976 Republican convention, the party endorsed a constitutional amendment that would restore protection of the right to life for unborn children. More than two dozen female convention delegates signed a minority report urging the party not to take an abortion position.By 1980, the Republican Party had become more explicit, promising in its platform to promote judges at all levels that would respect the sanctity of human life. But the party, and even some advisers to the nominee, former California governor Ronald Reagan, were still deeply divided.AdvertisementDonovan remembers being approached at the convention by Marty Anderson, a senior policy adviser to the Reagan campaign who dismissively told antiabortion activists in the hallway to be happy with what you got.Some people on Reagans team were not pro-life and there were many of them that were unhappy, Donovan remembered.Those divisions would surface a year later with the naming of Reagans first Supreme Court nominee, Sandra Day OConnor. Her friend, Carolyn Gerster, who founded the Arizona Right to Life Committee, testified before the Senate that OConnor had repeatedly voted in the state Senate to protect abortion.We are concerned, John C. Willke, the head of National Right to Life, said that same day.OConnors confirmation set a template that would haunt the antiabortion movement for decades. She was followed onto the court by Reagan appointee Anthony M. Kennedy and George H.W. Bush appointee David Souter. Both joined OConnor in 1992 in endorsing the essential holding of Roe as part of the Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision.AdvertisementOn the legislative front, the antiabortion forces had still not found a way to power. In June 1983, a Senate vote on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion failed. Fifteen Democrats voted for the amendment, and 19 Republicans voted against it.Just two weeks prior, the Supreme Court had reaffirmed the right to an abortion, striking down a local ordinance imposing restrictive regulations on abortion providers.In the wake of defeat, Americans United for Life, an antiabortion law firm and advocacy group, convened a strategic national conference in March 1984 at the Palmer House Hilton Hotel in Chicago. The idea behind the event, titled Reversing Roe v. Wade Through the Courts, was to devise a coordinated legal strategy.It was a hopeful atmosphere, said Edward Grant, a past president and executive director of Americans United for Life and an attorney.AdvertisementAnother setback came in 1987, when Reagans nomination of Robert Bork, who publicly criticized the legal rationale that undergirded Roe, was defeated in the Senate, forcing yet another deep internal reckoning and retrenchment.Initially, it was people going, Oh my God, what just hit us? said Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network. It took a long time for people on the right to figure out what the best response was.New StrategiesReturn to menuThe organized response had, in fact, already begun, spearheaded by a group of law students at Yale, Harvard and the University of Chicago, who began meeting under the auspices of the Federalist Society in 1982. They were united by the idea that American law had strayed too far from the original intent of the nations founders.The group grew in the late 1980s, with chapters and members proliferating across the United States. It soon became an influential group in Washington with a sprawling budget and deep access across Republican levers of government.Abortion was not the motivating factor, said Edwin Meese III, a former Reagan adviser who has for decades led the fight for conservative legal reforms, in an interview last December. It was a matter of being honest and faithful to what the Constitution actually said.These self-described originalists came to reject Roe as judicial activism, and found common cause with abortion opponents who could mobilize voters. At the same time, antiabortion activists stepped back to reconsider their approach. They decided after the Casey decision that the anti-feminist rhetoric of Schlafly and the Equal Rights Amendment struggles from the 1970s had become counterproductive.Share this articleShareWe had to convince the public that we were compassionate to women, Willke would later write about the new strategy. Accordingly, we test marketed variations on this theme.The result was a new slogan Love Them Both, mother and child and a sharp rejection of some of the more aggressive methods of protest in the 1980s such as Operation Rescue, which had harassed women outside abortion clinics.What it is like to have a baby in states most likely to ban abortionsAmericans have usually been pretty unhappy about the idea of punishing patients, said visiting Harvard law professor Mary Ziegler, who has written extensively on the history of the movement.After the Year of the Woman swept four new female Democratic senators and Bill Clinton into office in 1992, abortion opponents founded the Susan B. Anthony List, named for the 19th century suffragist, aimed at electing more pro-life women to office.But as the movement made progress rebranding itself with the public, it found its foothold in the Republican Party remained tenuous. The 1996 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, asked to modify his partys plank to include a declaration of tolerance for those who did not oppose abortion.This is not compromise, it is civility, Dole said. A rebellion ensued, only to be settled by Dole making clear that he had not read the antiabortion platform on which his candidacy was based.The tensions within the party would only grow in the coming years as the evangelical right, which had by now fully unified against abortion, increasingly made threats against the Republican Party.Paul Weyrich, the founder of the Heritage Foundation who coined the term moral majority, declared in 1999, We probably have lost the culture war. Leaders like James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, began warning that evangelicals would bolt from the Republican Party.We were both saying to the party, you cant play games with this issue. So it was serious, said Gary Bauer, a candidate for president in 2000 who worked with Dobson. Many people felt that Republican leaders had to be educated about where their own voters were.Conservatives are winning the battle for Americas courts, a triumph decades in the making. This is how they did it. Video Dalton Bennett, Jesse Mesner-Hage, Jorge RibasThe Washington PostThe anger had the effect of solidifying support. When President George W. Bush nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court in 2005, the response was fierce. She had spoken about self-determination guiding abortion decisions and gave confusing answers on the right to privacy.There was a tremendous backlash, Bauer said.Miers withdrew her nomination within weeks. Her replacement as a nominee, Samuel Alito, was easily confirmed. He became the author of the draft opinion completely overturning Roe that leaked last week from the Supreme Court.ConsolidationReturn to menuThe consolidation of the antiabortion movements political power would only continue in the coming years, as the parties sorted themselves along culture war lines, even as the nations overall view of abortion remained constant.According to Gallup, the share of Americans who do not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe was 58 percent in both 1989 and 2021. In 1975, 22 percent of Americans wanted abortion illegal in all circumstances, compared to 19 percent in 2021.But the share of Democrats who said abortion should be legal under any circumstances rose from 19 percent to 50 percent between 1975 and 2021. The share of Republicans who want to outlaw all abortion went from 25 percent to 31 percent.In the Senate today, there are only three Democrats who oppose using federal funds for abortions. In the House, there is just one, and he is locked in a tight primary battle.The 2010 midterm elections were a major turning point in the partisan shift. Antiabortion Democrats were voted out of office for having supported the Affordable Care Act, which allows plans in the insurance marketplaces to cover abortion, although states are allowed to ban such coverage. At the same time, a new generation of Republican lawmakers who prioritized cultural issues were swept into office.How women are talking about the possible end of Roe v. WadeThe Republican midterm wins also gave states new powers to redraw legislative district lines, further growing the power of antiabortion forces in Republican-dominated states.The pushback to Obamas pro-abortion policies was so pronounced at the state level, said Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, who credits the former Democratic president with propelling the antiabortion cause. We began to see this wave of pro-life legislation.By the fall of 2011, antiabortion advocates had started pushing for bold restrictions with brash new tactics. When Janet Porter introduced the first heartbeat bill in the country to ban abortions after six weeks, she showed up in the Ohio Statehouse with ultrasound videos to demonstrate the cardiac activity of a fetus, which she described as the youngest person to ever speak at the Ohio Statehouse.Over 200 antiabortion restrictions were enacted between 2011 and 2013, more than had taken effect for the entire previous decade.We sent a signal that being pro-choice was a disqualifier, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List. Having an R next to your name was not enough.But even after 2010, when the vast majority of Republicans identified publicly as antiabortion, conservative advocates and lawmakers were bitterly divided on exactly how far that legislation should go. The most established antiabortion groups argued that proposed heartbeat bills went too far and would bait a liberal Supreme Court to issue a decision that might expand abortion rights even further.It was the right idea at the wrong time, said Michael Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life.The largest antiabortion groups, including National Right to Life, whose lawyer testified against the six-week ban in Ohio, had long taken a more incremental approach, pushing various clinic rules and restrictions that would make abortion care more difficult without banning the procedure outright, under the theory that such measures had a better chance of withstanding court challenges.National groups like Americans United for Life remained focused on a mother child strategy, which included talking about their belief that some forms of abortion are dangerous for the woman while pushing legislation that purported to make clinics safer. They sought to mandate clinics to widen their hallways or hire doctors with admitting privileges at local hospitals, moves that led to closure of some clinics.The Trump EraReturn to menuThe direction of the movement changed again when a New York businessman and television personality suddenly stormed his way into the 2016 Republican presidential nomination fight. With a documented personal life that did not lend itself to evangelical support, Trump made overturning Roe v. Wade a centerpiece of his campaign, at one point even suggesting that there needs to be some form of punishment for women who seek the procedure before backtracking.Here's a look back at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's changing views on abortion. Video Jenny StarrsThe Washington PostAt a lunch with more than a dozen others that year at the powerhouse law firm Jones Day, Trump said he wanted to make the Supreme Court a campaign priority, surprising some in the room, including Leo, a devout Catholic who regularly visits the Vatican. Leo told others it was easy to come up with list of judges that would please the Republican base because there were decades of conservative lawyers in the pipeline.The success of this movement has been the result of sharp and unwavering focus, growing public sentiment against overreach by judges, and consensus among conservative activists around a single principle that having judges who respect the limits on their power and who enforce the limits on the power of the rest of government, as set forth in the Constitution, is the best way to preserve the dignity and worth of all people in the long run, Leo said.Trump would benefit from the fact that when Scalia died unexpectedly in February 2016, McConnell immediately announced from a trip in the Virgin Islands that he would not replace him with Obamas nominee to the Supreme Court. McConnells critics called the move craven, and even some Republicans wondered if he could hold.Abortion rights leaders were furious. They broke all the rules, said Hagstrom Miller, who testified against Justice Neil M. Gorsuch during his confirmation hearings. It just feels like they lied and cheated and stole those really important roles, and now we cant rely on the justice system.Gorsuch, Trumps first Supreme Court nominee, was one of those included on the first list of six people that Leo had brought to Trump. Leo went to the White House in 2017 with a second list of five proposed candidates that included Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who would become Trumps next two picks for the high court, replacing the retiring Kennedy and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Leo, McGahn and McConnell became a team, working to keep the judicial nominations effort moving even as other parts of Trumps term fell victim to internal fighting. The three men usually agreed, with McGahn and Leo, among others, searching for nominees, and McConnell quickly confirming them. McConnell credited Trumps advisers for the picks and Trump himself for signing off on them.Republicans seek to change the subject on cusp of abortion winTrump would frequently ask advisers if his administration was setting records for judicial nominees, and if judicial candidates were tough and looked the part, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions. He never veered from the lists of candidates suggested by Leo and others, they said.Josh Holmes, a McConnell adviser, said it was an eternal campaign to keep the accolades rolling in so Trump would stay interested in the topic.Part of McConnells goal was to make sure that Trump was getting the accolades that he needed to keep on doing what he was doing, Holmes said. There was no shortage of effort to raise the profile of the judges issue so Trump would continue to have interest in it. Every time I saw Trump privately, hed say, Mitch McConnell. Judges. Judges. Judges. The only thing he wants is judges.A spokesman did not respond to a request to interview Trump for this story. Leo found he had extensive access in the White House, and that the judges issue moved quickly compared to previous White Houses, he told others.After Gorsuchs confirmation in 2017, Trump was delighted by the progress. Flying on Air Force One, Trump raved to McConnell and others about what a good nominee he had been, according to Rep. Garland Andy Barr R-Ky., who told the story on the Ruthless podcast last week.And he went on for a pretty good while with his monologue about how this was the greatest choice ever to the United States Supreme Court. And at some point, after about 10 minutes or so, the president took a breath, Barr recalled. When there was a pause in the action, leader McConnell didnt miss a beat. He kind of leaned forward and he said, 'Mr. President, when are you going to thank me for that?Ironically, the two men who had played such a central role in reshaping the nations judiciary have not spoken since the end of 2020, after Trump turned on McConnell for not attempting to overturn the results of the election he lost.By the end of his presidency, in part because of the 2020 death of Ginsburg, Trump had named over 220 conservative judges to the federal bench. Abortion rights advocates were helpless to stop the transformation, which culminated in the confirmation of Barrett, who took the oath of office eight days before Trump lost reelection.The most devastating gut punch was when Justice Ginsburg died, said Kristin Ford, the vice president of communications and research at NARAL, a national abortion rights group. I remember bracing for how much worse things were going to get.The AftermathReturn to menuThe sudden shift in the makeup of the high court opened the floodgates in state legislatures. At least nine states passed abortion bans in 2019 that clearly violated Roe, which protects abortion up to the point of viability, around 22 to 24 weeks, each hoping their law would make it all the way up to an increasingly conservative Supreme Court.In May 2021, the activists got what they were looking for when the Supreme Court agreed to consider a ban from Mississippi that outlawed abortion at 15 weeks in the case thats now poised to overturn Roe.By the time the Southern Baptist Convention gathered last year, they had fully repudiated their past views, embracing an aggressive approach that some in the antiabortion movement had rebuffed just a few years before.Some Supreme Court justices might contradict their confirmation hearing testimony if they side with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.s draft opinion on abortion. Video Blair GuildThe Washington PostWe will not embrace an incremental approach alone to ending abortion because it challenges Gods Lordship over the heart and the conscience and rejects His call to repent of sin completely and immediately, the platform read.Meanwhile, antiabortion advocates in Texas decided not to wait for a Supreme Court ruling. Frustrated by all the bans that had been blocked by the courts, former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell developed a novel legal strategy with lawmakers to evade a court challenge empowering private citizens to enforce the law. The gambit worked.PRAISE THE LORD! Texas state representative Matt Schaefer R texted Mitchell just after the Supreme Court ruled in early September to allow the six-week abortion ban in Texas to take effect.That night, Mitchell let the significance of the moment sink in.

As of the early 2020s, abortion debate in the United States saw the Supreme Court as a central battleground, especially with Roe v. Wade’s uncertain future and states increasingly challenging federal abortion protections.

Political Realignment and Consolidation

By the late 20th century, anti-abortion movements gained substantial influence, as both political parties became more polarized on the issue. Despite steady public support for abortion rights (Gallup reports showed that around 58% of Americans consistently opposed overturning Roe), the issue solidified partisan lines, with Republicans generally advocating for stricter abortion laws and Democrats largely supporting abortion rights. Notably, anti-abortion Democrats almost disappeared by the 2010s, as conservative Republicans won state and federal offices, pushing legislation focused on limiting abortion.

Strategic Shifts in Anti-Abortion Tactics

The 2010 midterm elections were pivotal, with Republicans gaining control of redistricting processes and sweeping anti-abortion legislation at the state level. Initially, anti-abortion advocates pursued incremental restrictions, like mandating clinic safety standards, which led to the closure of some clinics and skirted more direct constitutional challenges to Roe. However, more assertive measures—such as six-week “heartbeat bills”—eventually took hold, indicating a shift towards more aggressive legislative approaches.

Influence of the Trump Administration

Donald Trump’s presidency marked another significant shift. Despite his initially mixed stance on abortion, Trump capitalized on judicial appointments, making the Supreme Court a campaign priority. Backed by figures like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, Trump appointed over 220 conservative judges, including three Supreme Court justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. These appointments solidified a conservative majority on the Court, which had repercussions for abortion rights and other cultural issues.

State Responses and Texas’s Legal Innovation

In 2021, Texas enacted a six-week abortion ban using a legal maneuver that allowed private citizens, rather than the state, to enforce the ban, sidestepping court challenges. The law effectively restricted abortion access in Texas and inspired other states to adopt similar legislation, circumventing traditional judicial review and creating a precedent for state-driven enforcement mechanisms.

The Aftermath and Future Implications

As of 2021, several states passed abortion bans anticipating that the conservative Supreme Court might uphold them. The Supreme Court’s decision to consider Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban brought the issue of Roe v. Wade’s survival to the forefront. The Southern Baptist Convention, among other religious groups, repudiated prior incremental approaches, pushing instead for an immediate end to abortion.

Today, the national landscape shows a patchwork of abortion laws varying by state, with ongoing battles expected in court and through state-level referendums. With major implications for the 2024 election, abortion remains a polarizing issue likely to influence candidates, legislation, and the judiciary for years to come.","['Roe v', 'Wade', 'The Washington Post', 'Roe Roe', 'Wade', 'Dobbs', 'Jackson', 'Womens Health', '##bor', 'Roe Roe', 'Wade', 'Dobbs', 'Womens Health', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Republican', 'Supreme Court', 'Michael Scherer', 'Josh Dawsey', 'Caroline Kitchener', 'Rachel Roubein', 'Supreme Court', 'Bonnie Jo Mount', 'Washington Post', 'Trump Era', 'Mitch McConnell', 'Donald Trump', 'Supreme Court', 'McConnell', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee', 'Donald McGahn', 'White House', 'Arrow', 'Leonard Leo', '##onnell', 'Trump Tower', 'New', 'York', 'Trump', 'Ivan', 'Leo', 'Trump']","The article outlines the key moments and strategies that led to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court, focusing on the political and legal shifts in the anti-abortion movement over several decades.

Key Events and Strategies:
	1.	Harriet Miers’ Nomination (2005): President George W. Bush’s nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court faced intense backlash from conservatives due to her ambiguous views on abortion. Miers withdrew, and her replacement, Samuel Alito, was confirmed and later authored the draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade.
	2.	Shifting Politics: Despite public opinion remaining relatively constant on abortion (with around 58% of Americans opposing the overturning of Roe), the political landscape shifted significantly. By 2021, a majority of Democrats supported abortion rights, while a smaller but increasing number of Republicans sought to outlaw abortion entirely.
	3.	2010 Midterms and Cultural Politics: The 2010 midterm elections saw anti-abortion Democrats ousted and a new wave of Republican lawmakers elected, focusing on cultural issues like abortion. States gained more power to enforce restrictive abortion laws, and a new generation of pro-life legislation emerged.
	4.	Heartbeat Bills (2011-2013): Anti-abortion activists introduced extreme measures like the “heartbeat bill” to ban abortions after six weeks. While the more established anti-abortion groups favored a slower, incremental approach, these aggressive tactics signaled a shift in strategy and forced a political realignment.
	5.	Trump Era (2016-2020): Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign made the appointment of conservative judges a central issue, with promises to overturn Roe v. Wade. His Supreme Court nominees—Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett—shifted the Court to a more conservative stance. With Mitch McConnell’s support, Trump appointed over 220 federal judges, reshaping the judiciary in line with conservative values.
	6.	The Role of McConnell and Leo: McConnell and conservative activist Leonard Leo played pivotal roles in securing conservative judicial appointments. Trump’s focus on judicial appointments helped solidify support for his administration, and by the end of his presidency, the judiciary was solidly conservative.
	7.	Ginsburg’s Death and Texas Abortion Law: The death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020 was a turning point, enabling Trump to appoint Barrett, further cementing conservative dominance in the Court. In 2021, Texas passed a law banning abortions after six weeks, bypassing federal courts by allowing private citizens to enforce the law—an approach that ultimately succeeded when the Supreme Court allowed the law to stand.
	8.	Anti-Abortion Movement’s Bold Shift: By 2021, the Southern Baptist Convention had fully embraced a more aggressive anti-abortion stance, rejecting the gradual approach previously favored by some. This marked a shift toward immediate action to end abortion completely, mirroring the strategies of state-level lawmakers in Texas and other conservative states.

The article underscores the long-term, strategic efforts by conservatives to reshape the judicial landscape and push for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, culminating in the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case that would ultimately overturn the landmark ruling. This political realignment reflects broader cultural divides in the U.S. and the growing influence of anti-abortion advocates within the Republican Party.",L,

When it takes place outside abortion clinics, thus upsetting patients and medical staff, according to Nicola Sturgeon, Scotlands first minister. The presence of hard-praying anti-abortionists from 40 Days for Life, a group based in Texas, outside Scottish hospitals and clinics has prompted Ms Sturgeon to back legislation that would allow no-go buffer zones around abortion providers. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the element.Introduced into England in 2010 and Scotland in 2017, 40 Days for Life holds 40-day vigils twice a year in more than a dozen places across Britain. The latest began on September 28th. Though the group says it discourages volunteers most of whom are locals from using graphic images of aborted fetuses and yelling, it has attracted some protesters who do. Shawn Carney, its co-founder and chief executive, says that doesnt worry him. Our main concern is the bigotry of the government, he says. Sturgeondoesnt like us, so she wants to get rid of us. If the buffer law is passed, he says We will sue.Mr Carneys group is one of several American pro-life organisations that are stepping up their activities in Britain. CBR UK, an affiliate of the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform, a Californian anti-abortion outfit that disseminates particularly gruesome images, says its British network of volunteer educators, who set up street displays, has grown from 50 a decade ago to 500. Dave Brennan, head of the groups church ministry, says it wants to double that within a year. The group is currently focusing on universities. Stanton Health Care, from Idaho, which operates clinics that try to dissuade women from terminating pregnancies, opened in Belfast in 2015 and will do so in Edinburgh this year. British pro-lifers hope that they can learn from the long and successful campaign to overturn Roe v Wade, the American Supreme Court ruling of 1973 that enshrined the right to an abortion. American pro-lifers have also played prominent roles in campaigns to keep children on life support alive against the wishes of their doctors and the courts.Such activists are often supported in their efforts by ADF UK, the British chapter of Alliance Defending Freedom, an American conservative legal-advocacy group, which opened in 2015. With Christian Concern, a British association of similarly crusading lawyers, it set up the Wilberforce Academy, which trains young people for Christ-centred leadership. Freedom of speech and of religious expressionissues that have been more prominent in America than Britainare at the heart of ADF UKs battles. Its lawyers represented a midwifery student at Nottingham University who faced an investigation over her public opposition to abortion. In 2020 the university apologised and settled. The following year ADF UK helped a Catholic priest from Glasgow successfully challenge the governments attempt to close churches during lockdown.Future campaigns seem likely to focus on the push to introduce abortion buffer zones. In America ADF sued to strike down a law allowing such zones in Massachusetts and won. Though the British Pregnancy Advisory Service says protests outside clinics are becoming more common, a policy on buffer zones across England and Wales seems unlikely soon. In 2018 Sajid Javid, then the home secretary, said there was little need for one. Yet several councils have established their own zones or are considering doing so. The Supreme Court has been asked to consider whether a prospective law allowing buffer zones in Northern Ireland would disproportionately affect the right to protest.Claims that buffer zones criminalise free speech have begun to influence anti-abortionists arguments more widely, according to Lucy Grieve, co-founder of Back Off Scotland. She set up the group in 2020 to oppose protests in Edinburgh, where she is a student. She has noticed a shift, she says, away from moral objections to abortion to talk about free speech. That is good news for Mr Carney of 40 Days for Life. Even pro-choice Britons agree with him about its importance, he says. Freedom of speech is being butchered in Scotland. They can ban usbut they cant do that and call themselves a free democracy.

These groups, including those from the US, are working to influence public opinion on abortion and have been involved in efforts to introduce “buffer zones” around abortion clinics, where protests are restricted.

40 Days for Life, which holds 40-day vigils at abortion clinics twice a year, is a prominent example. While the group discourages confrontational tactics like graphic images, some volunteers have still resorted to such methods. Shawn Carney, co-founder of 40 Days for Life, insists that the group’s activities should not be viewed as disruptive protests, despite opposition from figures like Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon supports laws that would create buffer zones to prevent protests near clinics, which Carney has vowed to challenge if passed.

Other American-based groups, like CBR UK, have expanded their operations in Britain, with volunteer numbers growing. They aim to mirror the success of the US anti-abortion movement, particularly after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Groups like Stanton Health Care have also set up clinics in the UK, where they attempt to dissuade women from abortion. The legal arm of these efforts is supported by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF UK), which has backed legal cases in favor of free speech and religious freedom, including a notable case where a midwifery student in the UK was investigated for opposing abortion.

There is also significant debate over the introduction of buffer zones in the UK. While some local councils have already established them, the government has been reluctant to implement a national policy. Pro-life advocates argue that such zones infringe on free speech rights, a position that has gained traction in Scotland, where protests have become more common. Critics of buffer zones assert that they undermine democracy and free expression, even among some pro-choice individuals who support freedom of speech.

In summary, American pro-life groups are actively expanding their influence in Britain, with a focus on opposing abortion, promoting free speech, and challenging potential laws that would restrict protests at abortion clinics. These efforts are reshaping the debate around abortion rights and free expression in the UK.","['American', 'Britain', 'Economist', 'Econ', '##rael', 'Hamas', 'Ukraine', '##na', 'Economist', '##rael', 'Hamas', 'Ukraine', 'World', '##na', 'Economi', 'States', 'East AfricaAs', 'Americas', 'US', 'Economist', 'Economist', 'Economist', 'Economi', 'Britain', 'St', 'Scotland', 'Texas', 'Scottish']","American pro-life activism has increased in Britain, especially around abortion clinics where groups such as Texas-based “40 Days for Life” have held vigils. This organization, introduced in England in 2010 and in Scotland in 2017, organizes 40-day events twice annually, involving local volunteers who protest quietly, though some supporters use graphic images. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland supports creating buffer zones around abortion facilities to keep protesters away, aiming to reduce the distress caused to patients and medical staff. In response, 40 Days for Life’s leader, Shawn Carney, argues that such zones infringe on free speech and pledges legal action if the law is enacted.

In addition to “40 Days for Life,” other U.S.-based pro-life groups, such as Stanton Health Care from Idaho, have expanded into Britain, opening clinics that encourage alternatives to abortion. Another American organization, the Alliance Defending Freedom UK (ADF UK), provides legal assistance to pro-life activists in cases involving free speech and religious expression. For example, ADF UK supported a student and a priest in legal challenges related to abortion protests and religious freedom during the COVID-19 lockdown.

While the British government has not established a national policy on buffer zones, local councils have created or considered similar measures. Debate over buffer zones has spurred pro-life groups to frame their protests as free speech issues, resonating with some British citizens who may otherwise be pro-choice.",C,

Searcht Updates Countries Disasters Organizations Topics Jobs Training Informing humanitarians worldwide 247 a service provided by UN OCHA Chad 8 more Sahel project helps women raise themselves, their communities from poverty Format News and Press Release Source UNFPA Posted 16 Jun 2020 Originally published Origin View original Ms. Brema trains women in her village to become electricians. Vincent TremeauBanque mondiale AM TIMAM, Chad Once, Adouia Brema was a child bride forced to leave school. Today, she gives her community the gift of light. Her journey from vulnerable teen mother to solar cell electrician shows the remarkable feats that marginalized women and girls can achieve when they are empowered with information and economic opportunities. I was only 13 years old when I got married. The day I got married, I was in sixth grade, Ms. Brema recalled. At first, they let me continue going to school. Then I gave birth to my first two children. I found myself all alone in the house and I had to drop out of school so that I could take care of my home and my children. Today, I have eight children. Her experience is not unique Chad has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world 67 per cent of young women were married before age 18, according to the 2019 State of World Population report. For many child brides, marriage means a swift exit from schooling and entry into motherhood. They are less able to advocate for themselves, have less access to health services and higher vulnerability to violence. Their communities forgo the full fruit of their potential. But change is possible. Not just a mans job The Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Project SWEDD gives women and girls across West Africa vocational training so that they can earn more and have a better future. The project also strengthens girls education, increases access to reproductive health services, and engages whole communities on issues including child marriage, human rights and gender equality. Through SWEDD, Ms. Brema enrolled in a course to become an electrician. At first, we thought that electricity, with all those wires, was a mans job, she said. We felt like we couldnt do it. But we were told not to panic. We could do it. She and her classmates learned quickly. We started to grasp some of the notions, such as solar panels, batteries and all of the electrical connections, she said. I was able to learn the basics in two weeks, and I started to work on my first electrical installations with no fear. Now we have a business. Empowered women lift the community In Chad and other countries where it is working, SWEDD has already provided professional training to more than 154,000 women. When marginalized women and girls are able to access information and opportunities, the benefits accrue to their whole families and communities. Ms. Bremas own experience bears this out. With her business, she and her partners have been able to provide low-cost lighting to their community members. Once the panels have been installed, electricity is free because it comes from the sun, she said. You get electricity day and night. Children use it all the time. Ms. Brema also trains other women in the village. Before, I depended on my husband. But today, we make a profit from each installation. Ever since I learned how to do a paid job, Ive wanted my sisters to follow my example. If they learn skills, they will be able to work and earn money too. Expanding opportunities The World Bank recently approved 376 million in additional funds to support the implementation of SWEDDs phase 2, which brings the World Bank's overall support to 680 million. In addition to supporting existing initiatives, the new injection of funding will help governments strengthen legal frameworks that support womens rights to health and education. Parliamentarians, judges and lawyers have already been consulted for this part of the project. Joining phase 2 are the West Africa Health Organization and the African Union. UNFPA will continue to implement SWEDD and provide technical guidance. The countries implementing the project are Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and the programme will soon roll out in Cameroun and Guinea. Most recently, UNFPA has supported SWEDD in the regional campaign StrongerTogether, which has the rallying cry My empowerment, my future, even in times of crisis! The campaign shares information about COVID-19, positive gender roles, water and sanitation, and menstrual hygiene. It also highlights distance learning for girls and the importance of having them return to school. We men must seize this time of crisis to be role models for our sons by supporting our wives and daughters. Let's break the cycle of violence, and build a better world for our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters and for ourselves, the messages say. Protecting and promoting the rights of adolescent girls must be emphasized. As for Ms. Brema, she recently told UNFPA the pandemic has been hard on her family and business. Still, she has always said that with the right resources, women and girls can create a better world for all We will help each other and our combined efforts will make a better future, she said.

One of the featured stories is that of Adouia Brema, a former child bride, who became a solar cell electrician and now contributes to her community by providing affordable solar electricity. Brema’s journey reflects the positive changes SWEDD fosters by providing women with vocational training, educational opportunities, and access to reproductive health services.

In Chad, where 67% of young women are married before 18, child marriage often leads to early motherhood, limited education, and economic dependence. SWEDD works to change this, offering training in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as electrical work. Brema’s success has inspired other women in her community to pursue similar opportunities, leading to greater financial independence and improved quality of life.

Through SWEDD, over 154,000 women have received professional training, and the program has had a broader impact by addressing issues like child marriage and gender equality. This initiative, supported by the World Bank, has also led to a legal framework strengthening women’s rights to health and education. The ongoing phase 2 of the project, backed by $376 million in funding, will expand these efforts and include new regional partners like the African Union.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SWEDD also launched the StrongerTogether campaign to promote positive gender roles, provide information on sanitation, and encourage girls’ education. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, Brema remains optimistic about the future, believing that women and girls, when given the right resources, can build a better world.","['Sahel', 'Chad', 'ReliefW', 'UN OCHA', 'Chad', 'Sahel', 'UNFPA', 'Brema', 'Vincent Tremeau', 'TIMAM', 'Chad', 'Adouia Brema', 'Brema', 'Chad', 'State of World Population', 'West Africa']","The Sahel Women’s Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project, aimed at empowering women and girls in West Africa, has made significant strides in reducing poverty by providing vocational training and opportunities for marginalized women. In Chad, one inspiring example is Adouia Brema, who transformed from a child bride forced to leave school into a successful solar cell electrician. Despite initially believing that electrical work was a male-dominated field, Brema enrolled in SWEDD’s training program and quickly learned to install solar panels and other electrical systems. She now runs a business providing affordable solar energy to her community, empowering not only herself but also other women by teaching them the skills she acquired.

Chad, along with other countries in the Sahel region, faces challenges such as high rates of child marriage—67% of women in Chad are married before the age of 18, limiting their educational and economic opportunities. SWEDD addresses these issues by enhancing girls’ education, providing access to reproductive health services, and promoting gender equality and human rights.

The SWEDD project has already trained over 154,000 women across countries like Chad, Benin, Burkina Faso, and Mali. The World Bank recently committed an additional $376 million to expand the program’s second phase, with a focus on strengthening legal frameworks to support women’s rights and health. The project also includes a campaign, StrongerTogether, which highlights the importance of empowering women, ensuring girls’ education, and supporting families, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through these efforts, women like Brema are not only lifting themselves out of poverty but also contributing to the broader development of their communities. Brema, who once depended on her husband, now contributes financially to her household and trains other women to do the same, emphasizing the transformative power of economic independence and education for women.",L,

BridgesTallahassee DemocratUPDATE FDA rules abortion pills may be dispensed in pharmaciesOn Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that constitutionally established the right to abortion.That passed abortion laws to the states, where Republican lawmakers quickly began to ban abortion in about half of them while some Democratic-led states worked to reinforce protections for the procedure. Access to abortion, in other words, now depends almost entirely on where you live. What does that mean to Floridians?In April of that year, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state's most restrictive abortion regulations since Roe v. Wade, banning nearly all abortions in Florida after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest.The law went into effect July 1, was briefly stopped by a Leon County judge who called it a likely violation of the state constitutions right to privacy., and then went back into effect when the state appealed.Here's what the new law means for pregnant people in Florida.'Dream bigger'How weekend marches keep advocates' fight for Roe v.

Wade mean?Previously Florida's new abortion law may have faced a constitutional challenge since it was more restrictive than Roe v. Wade. That is no longer the case.What does Florida's abortion ban do?As of July 1, the ""Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality"" law HB 5 bans all abortions at 15 weeks and later. The only exceptions are if carrying the pregnancy to term would result in serious injury or death for the mother or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. Two physicians must certify, in writing, that one of those conditions warrants the procedure.

""After 15 weeks, that is a child. And so the argument is, should you kill a baby after 15 weeks because it was conceived under certain circumstances?"" Senate President Wilton Simpson said.Abortion bill amendments blockedDespite attempts to block it, Florida Senate prepares abortion ban for final vote this weekDoes Florida have a waiting period for abortions?Yes. As of April the state requires anyone seeking an abortion wait 24 hours after an initial doctors visit before returning to undergo the procedure.Waiting periodAfter 7 year legal battle, Leon County judge signs off on Florida abortion waiting periodCan minors get an abortion in Florida?Florida required minors seeking an abortion to notify at least one parent 48 hours before an abortion and obtain consent from a parent or approval from a judge through a legal mechanism known as judicial bypass.What happens to doctors who perform an abortion after 15 weeks?If a physician violates the ban, they would be guilty of a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a 5,000 fine. If I get an abortion after 15 weeks will I be charged with murder?Unlike Georgia's abortion laws, Florida's does not expressly define a fetus as a human being and there are currently no listed penalties for the person getting the abortion. The state's existing laws only penalize the doctors performing it or anyone actively participating in the procedure. If I'm pregnant in Florida and need an abortion after 15 weeks, what do I do?If your pregnancy threatens your life or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, or if the fetus has not achieved viability and has a fatal abnormality, you still can get an abortion but you would need to get two physicians to certify that in writing first. Otherwise, you would need to travel out of state, and you may need to drive a while. Like Texas, Georgia bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually about six weeks, often before some people even know they're pregnant.Florida's laws still are more lenient than other states, including the ones that border us.As mind-boggling as it sounds, even with the 15-week restriction, we will be seen as a haven state, said Alexandra Mandado, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida.Many states with newly-restrictive laws and states with bills ready to go are expected to increase restrictions or ban abortion outright now that the Supreme Court decision has come down.Which states have banned abortion or made it illegal?There are 44 states with some ban on abortions after a certain point in a pregnancy, according to The Guttmacher Institute, an organization that works to study, educate, and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.Twelve states Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennesee, Texas, and West Virginia ban abortions entirely.Georgia bans them at 6 weeks.Two states, Florida and Arizona, ban them at 15 weeks.North Carolina bans them at 20 weeks.Nine states, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin, ban abortions at 22 weeks.Nevada, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania ban them at 24 weeks.14 states California. Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, MInnesota, Montana, New York, Rhode Island, Washington and Wyoming ban abortions at the point of viability.Virginia bans abortion at the beginning of the third trimeser of pregnancy, 25 weeks.Many of these states are currently attempting to further restrict abortion or already have new laws on the books that have been blocked or contested in courts.Are abortion pills still legal in Florida?Sort of. In 2021 the Food and Drug Administration permanently removed a key restriction on medication used to terminate pregnancies, allowing so-called ""abortion pills"" to be available by mail and prescribed through telehealth medical consultations due to pandemic restrictions, and in January of this year they announced that they could be dispensed in some pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens. The U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills even in states that have banned or restricted abortion access, the Department of Justice announced, since senders cannot know if the recipient will us them illegally.But Florida law requires the physical presence of a doctor for the abortion process, which includes talking to the patient 24 hours before the procedure, so telehealth consultations are not permitted and other abortion restrictions apply. Medical abortions must be performed within the first 11 weeks of pregnancy, an even tighter deadline than the state's.The abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, also must be prescribed, although people in states where telehealth abortions are banned have started driving over the border to states where they are not, as that can be considerably cheaper than driving to a possibly-far-off and overbooked clinic. The day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department will protect providers and anyone seeking abortions in states where it is legal. In particular, Garland said the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of mifepristone for medical abortions.Medical abortion Qu0026AAre abortion pills safe?

Both challenges seek to block the ban from going into effect and charge that it violates the state constitutions privacy amendment.What other restrictions on abortion does Florida have?Along with the restricted time period, abortion law in Florida currently requires that 24 hours before an abortion can occur, the physician performing it or a referring physician must, while physically in the same room, inform the patient of the physical risks of both getting an abortion and carrying the pregnancy to term and the probable gestational age of the fetus as determined by mandatory ultrasound.The physician must also provide state-directed counseling materials. The patient may refuse to look at the ultrasound.How many abortions are done in Florida?There were 79,648 abortions performed in 2021 in Florida, of which 59,252 74 were listed as elective, according to data from the state Agency for Health Care Administration. About 75,000 of them occurred in the first trimester, or the first 12 to 13 weeks of pregnancy, compared with 4,850 in the second, according to state data.State data shows 16,822 abortions were done because of social or economic reasons and 1,503 abortions were for the psychological health of the mother. Another 1,060 abortions were for the health of the mother yet not for life-endangering reasons, the data shows.There were 757 abortions due to serious fetal genetic defect, deformity or abnormality, another 119 abortions were performed because of a life-endangering condition to the mother, eight abortions were performed because of incest and 118 were done because of rape.Of the abortions because of serious genetic defect or some other abnormality, the state data shows 64 of them, or 484 abortions, were done in the second trimester. The second trimester starts at week 13 and ends at week 26, according to the Mayo Clinic.Do Florida doctors support the new abortion ban?Some do, many don't. Roughly 700 physicians in Florida signed an open letter to the state Legislature opposing the 15-week abortion ban, calling it an alarming attempt to improperly insert politics into the patient-clinician relationship and said the consequences for Floridians would be dire.This legislation is bad medicine and bad policy, and we urge you to reject it for numerous reasons, the letter states.Do Florida voters support the new abortion ban?According to a poll by the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Laboratory, 55 percent of voters surveyed opposed the abortion bill. Opposition grew to 60 percent when people were told it didnt make exceptions for victims of rape or incest.Thirty-four percent of the people surveyed supported the idea, according to a release from UNF.Gallup PollMost Americans identify as pro-choice and believe abortion is 'morally acceptable'UNF pollMost voters don't back abortion ban, 'Don't Say Gay' bills in Florida LegislatureWill Florida pass more restrictive abortion laws?Quite possibly.Gov.

Wade, which returned the authority to regulate abortion to individual states. Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in April 2022, restricting abortion access after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Here’s a summary of the key points:
	1.	15-Week Abortion Ban: The law, effective July 1, 2022, bans most abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions only for cases where the mother’s life is at risk or the fetus has a fatal abnormality. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. This law redefines gestation from fertilization to the first day of the last menstrual period.
	2.	Enforcement and Penalties: Doctors who perform abortions after the 15-week limit face criminal penalties, including up to five years in prison and a fine of $5,000. However, individuals seeking abortions are not penalized under this law.
	3.	Waiting Period and Parental Consent for Minors: A 24-hour waiting period is required, and minors must notify a parent 48 hours before the procedure, or seek judicial approval for a bypass.
	4.	Abortion Pills: Abortion pills are allowed in Florida but must be prescribed by a doctor and can only be used within the first 11 weeks of pregnancy. Florida law requires in-person consultations, meaning telehealth options for abortion are not permitted.
	5.	Public Opinion and Legal Challenges: Public opinion is divided, with 55% of Floridians opposing the new law, especially its lack of exceptions for rape and incest. The law is being challenged in court by groups like Planned Parenthood, but it is currently in effect.
	6.	Abortion Access in Other States: While Florida’s law restricts abortion to 15 weeks, neighboring states like Georgia impose bans at 6 weeks. Some states, like California and New York, protect abortion rights more broadly.
	7.	Future Legislation: There is speculation that Florida may pass even stricter laws in the future, including a potential “heartbeat” law, which would ban abortion at around 6 weeks of pregnancy when a fetal heartbeat can be detected.

In conclusion, while Florida’s 15-week abortion ban is one of the more restrictive laws in the country, the state still provides relatively more access than others with stricter bans. Legal and political challenges are ongoing, and public opinion remains divided on the issue.","['DeSantis', 'Florida', 'News Sports Entertainment', 'Florida', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'C', 'A', '##allahassee', 'Democrat', 'FDA', 'Supreme Court', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Floridian', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Florida', 'Leon', 'County', 'Florida', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Roe v', 'Wade', 'Florida', 'Roe', 'Wade', 'Florida']","The article discusses the state of abortion laws in Florida following the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had federally protected the right to abortion. This decision shifted the regulation of abortion back to individual states, leading to a patchwork of laws across the country.

Key Points:
	1.	Florida’s Abortion Ban: In April 2022, Florida’s Governor, Ron DeSantis, signed into law a bill that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The only exceptions are if the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. The law went into effect on July 1, 2022, after being briefly halted by a Leon County judge, but was reinstated after an appeal.
	2.	Legal Landscape: The law redefines “gestation” from “fertilization” to “the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period.” The new law also includes a 24-hour waiting period for anyone seeking an abortion and requires parental consent or judicial approval for minors seeking the procedure. Violating the 15-week ban can lead to third-degree felony charges for doctors.
	3.	Impact on Access: Florida, under DeSantis, has become a key battleground in the abortion debate. While the 15-week ban is considered restrictive, it is more lenient than laws in neighboring states like Georgia, which bans abortion after 6 weeks. Florida remains a relative haven for those in neighboring states with stricter laws, such as Alabama and Texas.
	4.	Abortion Pills: Abortion pills, such as mifepristone, are still available in Florida, but the state law requires a physical doctor’s presence for the abortion process, which excludes telehealth consultations. The federal FDA allows abortion pills to be mailed in some states, but Florida’s regulations complicate their access.
	5.	Public Opinion: Polls indicate that the Florida abortion law is unpopular, with 55% of voters opposing it, and opposition rising to 60% when they learn the law does not include exceptions for rape or incest. Many Floridian physicians have expressed opposition to the law, citing concerns about its implications for patient care.
	6.	Future Legislation: Gov. DeSantis has signaled openness to further restrictions, potentially pushing for more aggressive legislation like a “heartbeat bill,” which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected (typically around 6 weeks). However, he has not made a clear commitment on this issue.
	7.	Abortion Statistics: In 2021, Florida recorded 79,648 abortions, with the majority occurring in the first trimester. A small number of abortions were performed for reasons such as rape, incest, or serious fetal abnormalities.

Conclusion: Florida’s abortion laws have become a focal point in the national debate following the Roe v. Wade reversal, with Governor DeSantis pushing for more restrictive measures. While the 15-week ban is one of the more moderate in the U.S., it still significantly alters access to abortion, with increasing legal and logistical barriers for women seeking the procedure.",R,

By Jim Denison, Op-ed Contributor Tuesday, August 04, 2020Every year, approximately forty thousand people die on American highways.Every ten days, that many abortions are performed in America.Doctors conduct 1.5 million abortions every year in the United States, more than the total of all Americas war dead across our history.Get Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get dailyweekly email with the top stories plus special offers! from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.SubscribeSince the U. S. Supreme Courts Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in January of 1973, more than 48 million abortions have been performed in America.This is a number larger than the combined populations of Kentucky, Oregon, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Iowa, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kansas, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, West Virginia, Nebraska, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Montana, Delaware, South Dakota, Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming.Depending on the year, an abortion occurs for every three or four live births in our country.Abortion is the moral issue of our time.It seems impossible to wrestle with the difficult issues of our day without addressing this crucial debate. Most conservative Christians believe that life begins at conception and abortion is therefore wrong. But are we sure? Is this a biblical fact?If the answer is clear, why have so many denominational leaders taken pro-choice positions?Is there a biblical, cohesive, practical position on this difficult subject?I began this essay with the conviction that the pro-life position is most biblical. But I did not know much about the legal issues involved, or the theological arguments for a womans right to choose abortion.As you will see, the debate is much more complex than either sides rhetoric might indicate. But I believe that there is an ethical position which even our relativistic society might embrace.Pro-life vs. pro-choiceAn abortion occurs when a conceptus is caused to die. To clarify vocabulary, conceptus is a general term for pre-born life growing in the mothers womb.More specifically, doctors often speak of the union of a sperm and an ovum as a zygote. A growing zygote is an embryo. When the embryo reaches around seven weeks of age, it is called a fetus. However, fetus is usually used in the abortion debate to describe all pre-born life.A miscarriage is a spontaneous, natural abortion.An indirect abortion occurs when actions taken to cure the mothers illness cause the unintended death of the fetus.A direct abortion occurs when action is taken to cause the intended death of the fetus.Why do so many people in America believe that a mother should have the right to choose direct abortion?In 1973, the Supreme Court issued Roe v. Wade, its landmark abortion ruling. In essence, the Court overturned state laws limiting a womans right to abortion. Its decision was largely based on the argument that the Constitution nowhere defines a fetus as a person or protects the rights of the unborn.Rather, the Court determined that an unborn baby possesses only potential life and is not yet a human being or person. It argued that every constitutional reference to person relates to those already born. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees protections and rights to individuals, but the Court ruled that the amendment does not include the unborn.The Court further determined that a womans right to privacy extends to her ability to make her own choices regarding her health and body. Just as she has the right to choose to become pregnant, she has the right to end that pregnancy.The Court suggested several specific reasons why she might choose abortionspecific and direct harm may come to hermaternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and futurepsychological harm may be imminentmental and physical health may be taxed by child careproblems may occur associated with bearing unwanted childrenand the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood should be considered.Since 1973, four positions have been taken in the abortion debateThere should be no right to an abortion, even to save the life of the mother. This has been the Catholic Churchs usual position.Therapeutic abortions can be performed to save the mothers life.Extreme case abortions can be permitted in cases of rape, incest, or severe deformation of the fetus. Most pro-life advocates would accept therapeutic and extreme case abortions.Abortion should be available to any woman who chooses it. This is the typical pro-choice position.Moral arguments for abortionPro-choice advocates make five basic claimsNo one can say when a fetus becomes a person, so the mother is the most appropriate person to make decisions regarding it.Abortion must be protected so a woman who is the victim of rape or incest does not have to bear a child resulting from such an attack.No unwanted child should be brought into the world.The state has no right to legislate personal morality.A woman must be permitted to make pregnancy decisions in light of her life circumstances.Many theologians, pastors, and denominational leaders consider these claims to be both biblical and moral.First, pro-choice proponents argue that a fetus is not legally a person.They agree with the Supreme Courts finding that the Constitution nowhere grants legal standing to a pre-born life. Only 40 to 50 percent of fetuses survive to become persons in the full sense. A fetus belongs to the mother until it attains personhood and is morally subject to any action she wishes to take with it.Second, abortion must be protected as an alternative for women who are the victims of rape or incest.While this number is admittedly small in this country approximately one percent of all abortions, it is growing in many countries around the world. As many as one in three women may become the victim of such an attack. They must be spared the further trauma of pregnancy and childbirth.Third, no unwanted children should be brought into the world.If a woman does not wish to bear a child, she clearly will not be an appropriate or effective mother if the child is born. Given the population explosion occurring in many countries of the world, abortion is a necessary option for women who do not want children. The woman is more closely involved with the fetus than any other individual and is the best person to determine whether or not this child is wanted and will receive proper care.Fourth, the state has no right to legislate our personal moral decisions.The government has no authority to restrict homosexuality, consensual sex, cigarette consumption, or other individual decisions that many people consider to be wrong. Since there is no constitutional standard for when life begins, decisions made regarding a fetus are likewise a matter for individual morality.The state should impose legislation on moral questions only when this legislation expresses the clear moral consensus of the community and when it prevents conduct which obviously threatens the public welfare. Nearly everyone condemns murder, for instance, and believes that it threatens us all. But Americans are divided on the morality of abortion. It is hard to see how aborting a fetus threatens the rest of the community.And so abortion should not be subject to governmental control. It is better to allow a mother to make this decision than to legislate it through governmental action. Many who personally consider abortion to be wrong are persuaded by this argument and thus support the pro-choice position.Fifth, the rights and concerns of the mother must take precedence over those of the fetus.Even if we grant fetuses limited rights, they must not supersede the rights of mothers, as the latter are clearly persons under the Constitution. If we allow abortion to protect her physical life, we should do so to protect her emotional health or quality of life as well.This was one of the Courts most significant arguments, as it sought to protect the mothers mental and physical health. Many pro-choice advocates are especially persuaded by this argument and view the abortion debate within the context of a womans right to control her own life.Moral arguments against abortionPro-life advocates counter each of these claims with their own ethical arguments.First, they assert that a fetus is a human life and should be granted the full protection of the law.The fetus carries its parents genetic code and is a distinct person. It does not yet possess self-consciousness, reasoning ability, or moral awareness the usual descriptions of a person, but neither do newborns or young children. As this is the central issue of the debate, well say more about it in a moment.Second, most pro-life advocates are willing to permit abortion in cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother.Since such cases typically account for only one to four percent of abortions performed, limiting abortion to these conditions would prevent the vast majority of abortions occurring in America.Third, pro-life advocates agree that all children should be wanted, so they argue strongly for adoption as an alternative to abortion.They also assert that an unwanted child would rather live than die. By pro-choice logic, it would be possible to argue for infanticide and all forms of euthanasia as well as abortion.Fourth, pro-life supporters do not see abortion legislation as an intrusion into areas of private morality.Protecting the rights of the individual is the states first responsibility. No moral state can overlook murder, whatever the personal opinions of those who commit it. The state is especially obligated to protect the rights of those who cannot defend themselves.But what of the claim that legislation must always reflect the clear will of the majority and protect the public welfare?The collective will of the culture must never supersede what is right and wrong. For instance, marijuana is so popular that as many as 100 million Americans say theyve tried it at least once. Nonetheless, we ban it because its harmful effects are clear to medical science. The effects of abortion on a fetus are obviously much more disastrous to the fetus. And just because society is unclear as to when life begins does not mean that the question is unknowable.If more of the public understood the physical and ethical issues involved in abortion, the large majority would consider abortion to be a threat to public welfare. Abortion threatens the entire community in three waysAbortion ends the lives of millions, on a level exceeding all wars and disasters combined.Abortion encourages sexual promiscuity.Abortion permits women to make a choice that will plague many of them with guilt for years to come.And so abortion meets the standard for legislative relevance and must be addressed and limited or abolished by the state.Fifth, pro-life advocates want to encourage the health of both the mother and the child and do not believe that we must choose between the two.As the rights of a mother are no more important than those of her newborn infant, so they are no more important than those of her pre-born child. The stress, guilt, and long-term mental anguish reported by many who abort their children must be considered. The legal right to abortion subjects a woman to pressure from her husband or sexual partner to end her pregnancy. Killing the fetus for the sake of the mothers health is like remedying paranoia by killing all the imagined persecutors. For these reasons, pro-life advocates argue that a moral state must limit or prevent abortion.For more on the ethical arguments for and against abortion see Milton A. Gonsalves Right Reason Ethics in Theory and Practice, 9th ed.When does life begin?This is obviously the crucial question in the abortion debate.If life does not begin until the fetus is viable or the child is born, one can argue that the right to life does not extend to the pre-born and abortion should be considered both legal and moral.But if life begins at conception, there can be no moral justification for abortion, since this action kills an innocent person.There are essentially three answers to our questionFunctionalism states that the fetus is a person when it can act personally as a moral, intellectual, and spiritual agent. Note that by this definition, some question whether a newborn infant would be considered a person.Actualism is the position that a fetus is a person if it possesses the potential for developing self-conscious, personal life. This definition would permit abortion when the fetus clearly does not possess the capacity for functional life.Essentialism argues that the fetus is a person from conception, whatever its health or potential. It is an individual in the earliest stages of development and deserves all the protections afforded to other persons by our society.Our Declaration of Independence begins, We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If an unborn child is considered a person, it possesses the inalienable right to life as well.So, can we determine when life begins?Our answer depends on the definition of life.A pro-choice advocate recognizes that the fetus is alive in the sense that it is a biological entity. But so is every other part of a womans body. Some consider the fetus to be a growth and liken it to a tumor or other unwanted tissue. Biology alone is not enough to settle the issue.What about capacity?Many ethicists define a person as someone able to respond to stimuli, interact with others, and make individual decisions. A fetus meets the first two standards from almost the moment of its conception, and clearly cannot fulfill the third only because it is enclosed in its mothers body. Would a newborn baby fulfill these three conditions?What about individuality?If we view a fetus as a growth within the mothers body, it would be easier to sanction her choice to remove that growth if she wishes. But a fetus is distinct from its mother from the moment of its conception.It is alive it reacts to stimuli and can produce its own cells and develop them into a specific pattern of maturity.It is human, completely distinguishable from all other living organisms, possessing all forty-six human chromosomes, able to develop only into a human being.And it is complete nothing new will be added except the growth and development of what exists from the moment of conception.It is a scientific fact that every abortion performed in the United States is performed on a being so fully formed that its heart is beating and its brain activity can be measured on an EEG machine. At twelve weeks, the unborn baby is only about two inches long, yet every organ of the human body is clearly in place.Theologian Karl Barth described the fetus wellThe embryo has its own autonomy, its own brain, its own nervous system, its own blood circulation. If its life is affected by that of the mother, it also affects hers. It can have its own illnesses in which the mother has no part. Conversely, it may be quite healthy even though the mother is seriously ill. It may die while the mother continues to live. It may also continue to live after its mothers death, and be eventually saved by a timely operation on her dead body. In short, it is a human being in its own right. Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics Edinburgh T T Clark, 1985 1961 3.4.416.And note that you did not come from a fetusyou were a fetus. A fetus is simply a human life in the womb. It becomes a baby outside the womb. But it is the same physical entity in either place.For these reasons, pro-life advocates believe that the U. S. Supreme Court was wrong in deciding that a fetus is not a person entitled to the full protections of the law.Apart from spiritual or moral concerns, it is a simple fact of biology that the fetus possesses every attribute of human life we find in a newborn infant, with the exception of independent physical viability. Left unharmed, it will soon develop this capacity as well. If a life must be independently viable to be viewed as a person, a young child might well fail this standard, as would those of any age facing severe physical challenges.What does the Bible say about abortion?These statements are based on moral claims and legal arguments. They are intended to persuade society regardless of a persons religious persuasion. But many in our culture also want to know what the Bible says on this crucial subject.Does the Bible talk about abortion?The word abortion appears nowhere in the Bible.No one in the Bible is ever described as having an abortion, encouraging one, or even dealing with one.The Bible says nothing which specifically addresses our subject.And so many have concluded that the issue is not a biblical concern but a private matter. They say that we should be silent where the Bible is silent.Pro-life advocates counter that by this logic we should be silent regarding the Trinity since the word never appears in Scripture. Or marijuana and cocaine since they are not in a biblical concordance. However, these issues came after the biblical era, while abortion was common in the ancient world. So this argument doesnt seem relevant.If abortion is a biblical issue, why doesnt the Bible address it specifically?The answer is simple the Jewish people and first Christians needed no such guidance. It was an undeniable fact of their faith and culture that abortion was wrong. How do we know?Consider early statements on the subject.The Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides is a book of Jewish wisdom written between 50 BC and AD 50. They state that a woman should not destroy the unborn babe in her belly, nor after its birth throw it before the dogs and vultures as a prey.The Sibylline Oracles are an ancient work of Jewish theology. They include among the wicked two groups women who produce abortions and unlawfully cast their offspring away and sorcerers who dispense materials which cause abortions 2339-42.The Mishnah instruction was the written record of Jewish oral teachings transmitted since the time of Moses. These teachings were committed to writing around 200 B.C. In the Mishnah tractate Sanhedrin we read We infer the death penalty for killing an embryo from the text, He who sheds the blood of a man within a man, his blood shall be shed what is a man within a man? An embryo Sanhedrin 57b, quoting Genesis 96.An abortion was permitted only to save the life of the mother If a woman was in hard travail life-threatening labor, the child must be cut up while it is in the womb and brought out member by member, since the life of the mother has priority over the life of the child but if the great part of it was already born, it may not be touched, since the claim of one life cannot override the claim of another life Oholoth 76.The Jews in the Old and New Testaments did not need to address the issue of abortion since no one considered it a moral option. In a similar vein, I have never preached a sermon against cigarette smoking or plagiarism. The Bible does not specifically speak to these subjects, and they are legal within certain limits, but no one in our congregation would consider them to be moral or healthy choices.When the Christian church moved out of its Jewish context, it encountered a culture that accepted the practice of abortion. And so, after the New Testament, Christians began speaking specifically to the subject.For instance, the Didache the earliest theological treatise after the Bible states You shall not procure an abortion, nor destroy a newborn child. And the Epistle of Barnabas early second century adds, Thou shalt love thy neighbor more than thy own life. Thou shalt not procure abortion, thou shalt not commit infanticide. These books were widely read and accepted in the first centuries of the Christian church.Important biblical passages about abortionWhile the Bible does not use the word abortion, it contains a number of texts that relate directly to the beginning of life and the value of all persons. Lets look briefly at the most pertinent passages.Exodus 2122Pro-choice scholars usually begin the discussion with this statement in Exodus When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the womans husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine. If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe Exodus 2122-25.The ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus commented on this text He that kicks a woman with child, so that the woman miscarry, let him pay a fine in money, as the judges shall determine, as having diminished the multitude by the destruction of what was in her womb and let money also be given to the womans husband by him that kicked her but if she die of the stroke, let him also be put to death, the law judging it equitable that life should go for life.But notice the translators note The law seems rather to mean, that if the infant be killed, though the mother escape, the offender must be put to death and not only when the mother is killed, as Josephus understood it. And note this later statement by Josephus The law, moreover, enjoins us to bring up all our offspring, and forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward and if any woman appears to have done so, she will be a murderer of her child, by destroying a living creature, and diminishing human kind.If this text does indeed teach that a person causing a miscarriage is only to be fined, while one causing harm is to receive severe punishment, we would have an important indication that the fetus is not as valuable as its mother. Is this what the text clearly teaches?The New Revised Standard renders the text, so that there is a miscarriage. The New American Standard follows suit, as does the New Jerusalem Bible. But the New International Version translates the text, she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury. The New Living Translation similarly states, they hurt a pregnant woman so that her child is born prematurely. If no further harm results . . . The English Standard Version renders the phrase, so that her children come out, but there is no harm. Why this crucial difference in translation?The Hebrew phrase is literally rendered, And they come forth children of her. Children is the plural of yeled, the usual Hebrew word for child or offspring the Hebrew language has no separate word for fetus or the pre-born. Come forth translates yatsa, a word which does not specify whether the child is alive or dead, only that it leaves the womb. And so the Hebrew of Exodus 2122 does not indicate whether the woman suffered a miscarriage NRSV, NASB, NJB or experienced a premature healthy birth NIV, NLT, ESV. But it does refer to the fetus as a child. And it is important to note that the text does not use shachol, the Hebrew word for miscarriage this word is found in Exodus 2326 and Hosea 914 among other occurrences.For further discussion of this linguistic issue see Jack W. Cottrells Abortion and the Mosaic Law in Readings in Christian Ethics.Verse 23 settles the issue for me But if there is serious injury . . . NIV, implying that no serious injury occurred in verse 22. In other words, both the mother and her child survived the attack and were healthy. And so this passage does not devalue the pre-born life or speak specifically to the issue of abortion.Genesis 27The Bible describes mans creation in this way In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung upfor the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the groundthen the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being Genesis 24-7.It seems that Adam did not become a living being until he could breathe. And so some believe that a fetus is not a living being until it can breathe outside the mothers womb. Until this time it is not yet a person. President Bill Clinton explained his pro-choice position as based significantly on this logic. He said that his pastor, W. O. Vaught, former pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas, told him that this was the literal meaning of the text.There are three problems with this argument.Adam was an inanimate object until God breathed into him the breath of life, but we know conclusively that a fetus is animate from the moment of conception.The fetus breathes in the womb, exchanging amniotic fluid for air after birth.Adam in Genesis 27 was a potential life even before he became a human being. By any definition, a fetus is at the very least a potential human being. Well say more about this fact in a moment.Psalm 139One of Davids best-loved psalms contains this affirmationFor it was you who formed my inward partsyou knit me together in my mothers womb.I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully madeWonderful are your works that I know very well.My frame was not hidden from you,when I was being made in secret,intricately woven in the depths of the earth.Your eyes beheld my unformed substance.In your book were writtenall the days that were formed for me,when none of them as yet existed Psalm 13913-16.David clearly believed that God created him in his mothers womb and beheld my unformed substance before he was born. Pro-life theologians point to this declaration as proof that life is created by God and begins at conception.Of course, those who do not accept the authority of Scripture will not be persuaded by this argument. And some who do believe that Davids statement is poetic symbolism rather than scientific description. He is simply stating that he is Gods creation, without speaking specifically to the status of a fetus.Jeremiah 15As part of Gods call to the prophet Jeremiah, the Lord issued this declaration Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you I appointed you a prophet to the nations Jeremiah 15. God clearly formed Jeremiah in the womb and knew him even before that time. He consecrated or called him to special service even before he was born. Gods plan for Jeremiah began before his conception and his birth.Its hard for me to see how those who accept biblical authority could make a pro-choice response to this statement. I suppose they could claim that the verse is symbolic and spiritual, not scientific, that it is a metaphorical description of Gods eternal plan for Jeremiah. But the text seems to be specifically related to Jeremiahs conception and gestation.Luke 139-45Lukes gospel records the visit of the pregnant Mary to the pregnant Elizabeth In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord Luke 139-45.When Elizabeth said that the child in my womb leaped for joy v. 44, she made clear the fact that her fetus was a fully responding being. She used the word brephos, the Greek term for baby, embryo, fetus, newborn child, young child, or nursing child. It is the same word used to describe Jesus in the manger, where the shepherds went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger Luke 216.Paul used the word in reminding Timothy how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus 2 Timothy 315. The Bible makes no linguistic distinction between the personhood of a human being, whether before or after its birth.What are the rights of the innocent?The Bible consistently defends the rights of those who are innocent and undeserving of punishment or death. For instanceDo not kill the innocent and those in the right, for I will not acquit the guilty Exodus 237.There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that hurry to run to evil, a lying witness who testifies falsely, and one who sows discord in a family Proverbs 616-19.The Babylonians attacked Jerusalem for the sins of Manasseh, for all that he had committed, and also for the innocent blood that he had shed for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord was not willing to pardon 2 Kings 243-4.It is clear that God cares for the innocent and defenseless of the world. Children, whether before their birth or after, would be among his most valued creations.How have Christians viewed abortion?How has the Church viewed the issue of abortion across its history?Are pro-choice religious leaders in step with traditional Christian thinking on this subject? Or has the Church even spoken with a unified voice when addressing the question?Early church fathers were clear in their opposition to abortion.Athenagoras ca. AD 150, Clement of Alexandria ca. 150-215, Tertullian ca. 155-225, St. Hippolytus ca. 170-236, St. Basil the Great ca. 330-79, St. Ambrose ca. 339-97, St. John Chrysostom ca. 340-407, and St. Jerome ca. 342-420 all issued strong condemnations of this practice.However, these theologians did not specifically say when the body receives a soul. This is the process called animation or ensoulment by early philosophers. Many in the ancient world followed the thinking of Aristotle 384-322 B.C. on the issue. He believed that ensoulment occurred forty days after conception in males and ninety days in females, and taught that abortion prior to this time was not murder.St. Augustine of Hippo 354-430, arguably the greatest theological mind after Paul, can be quoted on both sides of the issue. As regards whether souls are given to bodies at conception, Augustine said, He . . . who formed them, knows whether He formed them with the soul, or gave the soul to them after they had been formed. . . . I have no certain knowledge how it came into my body for it was not I who gave it to myself. He was critical of a theologian who was too dogmatic on this issue, claiming, how much better it is for him to share my hesitation about the souls origin. He did not believe that we can know when people obtain their souls.And yet Augustine was convinced that those who die in the womb will be resurrected with the rest of humanity and given p","The text discusses the biblical and theological perspectives on abortion, focusing on Jewish and Christian views, as well as key biblical passages that have been interpreted in the abortion debate.

Jewish Perspectives on Abortion:

Jewish teachings, both ancient and written in texts like the Sibylline Oracles and Mishnah, oppose abortion, considering it morally wrong. The Mishnah (specifically Sanhedrin) suggests that if a woman’s life is at risk during labor, the fetus may be sacrificed to save her, but otherwise, abortion is forbidden. Jewish law does not consider abortion a moral option unless the mother’s life is in danger, and even then, once the baby is born, its life cannot be sacrificed.

Early Christian Views:

Early Christian writings, including The Didache and The Epistle of Barnabas, firmly opposed abortion and infanticide. These early Christian texts reflected a strong stance against abortion, asserting that life is sacred from conception, similar to Jewish thought. As Christianity distanced itself from its Jewish roots, it confronted a culture where abortion was practiced, leading to more direct condemnations of the act.

Key Biblical Passages on Abortion:

	1.	Exodus 21:22-25: This passage discusses the consequences of causing a miscarriage during a fight. It has been interpreted in various ways, but it generally refers to the fetus as a “child,” though the punishment for causing a miscarriage is debated. Some translations imply a fine for miscarriage, while others emphasize the harm to the mother or child.
	2.	Genesis 2:7: The creation of Adam from the dust of the ground and the breath of life is used by some to argue that personhood begins when a fetus can breathe outside the womb. However, this interpretation is disputed, with others suggesting it only applies to Adam’s unique creation.
	3.	Psalm 139:13-16: David’s declaration that God formed him in his mother’s womb is used to argue that life begins at conception, with God creating life with a purpose before birth.
	4.	Jeremiah 1:5: God’s foreknowledge of Jeremiah before his conception is presented as evidence that personhood and God’s plan for individuals exist before birth, making abortion morally unacceptable.
	5.	Luke 1:39-45: The story of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth’s womb when Mary arrives demonstrates that the unborn child has responsiveness and personhood, further supporting pro-life views.

The Rights of the Innocent:

The Bible consistently defends the rights of the innocent, including the unborn. Verses such as Exodus 23:7, Proverbs 6:16-19, and 2 Kings 24:3-4 condemn shedding innocent blood, which has been applied to the abortion debate, reinforcing the argument that the unborn should be protected as innocent life.

Early Church Fathers’ Views on Abortion:

Early Church Fathers like Athenagoras, Tertullian, and St. Jerome were clear in their opposition to abortion. However, there was debate on when ensoulment (the arrival of the soul) occurs. Philosophers like Aristotle believed ensoulment happened after conception, leading to the view that abortion before this point might not be considered murder. St. Augustine expressed uncertainty about ensoulment but maintained that those who die in the womb would be resurrected with humanity.

Conclusion:

Throughout Jewish and early Christian teachings, abortion has been largely condemned as immoral. Biblical passages emphasize the sanctity of life from conception, and early Christian writings consistently reject abortion as a moral option. The debate centers on the value and personhood of the unborn, with theological arguments asserting that life begins at conception or shortly after, underscoring the responsibility to protect the innocent, including the unborn, as part of God’s plan for human life.""",,,,

These early Christian texts reflected a strong stance against abortion, asserting that life is sacred from conception, similar to Jewish thought. As Christianity distanced itself from its Jewish roots, it confronted a culture where abortion was practiced, leading to more direct condemnations of the act.

Key Biblical Passages on Abortion:

	1.	Exodus 21:22-25: This passage discusses the consequences of causing a miscarriage during a fight. It has been interpreted in various ways, but it generally refers to the fetus as a “child,” though the punishment for causing a miscarriage is debated. Some translations imply a fine for miscarriage, while others emphasize the harm to the mother or child.
	2.	Genesis 2:7: The creation of Adam from the dust of the ground and the breath of life is used by some to argue that personhood begins when a fetus can breathe outside the womb. However, this interpretation is disputed, with others suggesting it only applies to Adam’s unique creation.
	3.	Psalm 139:13-16: David’s declaration that God formed him in his mother’s womb is used to argue that life begins at conception, with God creating life with a purpose before birth.
	4.	Jeremiah 1:5: God’s foreknowledge of Jeremiah before his conception is presented as evidence that personhood and God’s plan for individuals exist before birth, making abortion morally unacceptable.
	5.	Luke 1:39-45: The story of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth’s womb when Mary arrives demonstrates that the unborn child has responsiveness and personhood, further supporting pro-life views.

The Rights of the Innocent:

The Bible consistently defends the rights of the innocent, including the unborn. Verses such as Exodus 23:7, Proverbs 6:16-19, and 2 Kings 24:3-4 condemn shedding innocent blood, which has been applied to the abortion debate, reinforcing the argument that the unborn should be protected as innocent life.

Early Church Fathers’ Views on Abortion:

Early Church Fathers like Athenagoras, Tertullian, and St. Jerome were clear in their opposition to abortion. However, there was debate on when ensoulment (the arrival of the soul) occurs. Philosophers like Aristotle believed ensoulment happened after conception, leading to the view that abortion before this point might not be considered murder. St. Augustine expressed uncertainty about ensoulment but maintained that those who die in the womb would be resurrected with humanity.

Conclusion:

Throughout Jewish and early Christian teachings, abortion has been largely condemned as immoral. Biblical passages emphasize the sanctity of life from conception, and early Christian writings consistently reject abortion as a moral option. The debate centers on the value and personhood of the unborn, with theological arguments asserting that life begins at conception or shortly after, underscoring the responsibility to protect the innocent, including the unborn, as part of God’s plan for human life.","The text presents a pro-life argument that emphasizes the biological, moral, and scriptural reasons against abortion. It argues that from the moment of conception, a fetus is a distinct human being, fully human with its own unique set of chromosomes and the capacity for growth and development. Pro-life advocates assert that abortion ends a human life, a stance that is supported by scientific evidence, including the fact that a fetus’s heart beats and brain activity can be measured from early stages of pregnancy. Theologian Karl Barth is cited, arguing that a fetus has its own autonomy and can experience its own illnesses, thus affirming its personhood even before birth.

The text addresses the question of what the Bible says about abortion, acknowledging that the word “abortion” is never mentioned in the Bible. However, it argues that biblical silence on the issue does not mean approval. In fact, the Jewish faith and early Christians universally condemned abortion, as seen in ancient Jewish texts such as the Mishnah and writings like The Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides and the Sibylline Oracles. These texts viewed abortion as morally wrong, with some even prescribing severe punishments for it. Early Christian writings, such as the Didache and the Epistle of Barnabas, also explicitly prohibited abortion.

Several Bible verses are cited to argue that life begins in the womb, which supports the pro-life perspective:
	•	Exodus 21:22-25 discusses a situation where a pregnant woman is injured, leading to a miscarriage, and while it does not specifically address the value of the fetus, it emphasizes the importance of protecting life.
	•	Genesis 2:7 describes God breathing life into Adam, a passage interpreted to support the idea that life begins at conception.
	•	Psalm 139:13-16 and Jeremiah 1:5 suggest that God forms individuals in the womb, implying that personhood and life begin there.
	•	Luke 1:39-45 describes the unborn John the Baptist reacting to the presence of Mary and the unborn Jesus, emphasizing that the fetus is a living, responsive being.

The Bible consistently upholds the rights of the innocent, including unborn children, with passages like Exodus 23:7 and Proverbs 6:16-19 condemning the shedding of innocent blood. This is interpreted to mean that abortion is a violation of the rights of the unborn, who are innocent and defenseless.

Historically, the Church has opposed abortion, with early Church Fathers like Athenagoras, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian issuing strong condemnations. While there was debate over when ensoulment (the moment the soul enters the body) occurs, the general consensus was that abortion was immoral regardless of the timing.

In conclusion, the text combines biological facts, biblical teachings, and historical Christian perspectives to argue that abortion is morally wrong and that the fetus, as a human life, deserves legal protection and respect.","['Bible', 'Bible', 'Christian Post', 'JavaScript', 'S', 'World', '##CP', 'Board', 'English', 'Modern Version', '##on DeSantis', 'American', 'Haiti', '##eorgia', 'Kathie Lee Gifford', 'God', 'Charles Stanley', 'Jesus', 'Palm', 'Red Pill', 'The Christian Post', 'American', 'America', 'United', 'States', 'Americas', 'Christian']",,R,
,"Here’s a comprehensive summary of this detailed examination of abortion from scientific, biblical, historical, and ethical perspectives:

The article continues with a close examination of abortion through biological, theological, and historical lenses. Pro-life advocates argue that a fetus is a distinct, complete, and fully human entity from conception, able to respond to stimuli, develop its own cells, and operate independently from the mother’s biological systems. Referencing theologians like Karl Barth, pro-life supporters highlight that a fetus possesses human characteristics including a heartbeat and brain activity detectable by modern technology. For these reasons, they contend that the fetus is not merely a growth within the mother but a unique life, deserving full legal protections.

The biblical argument against abortion is explored through various passages that imply a high value on unborn life. Though the Bible never explicitly discusses abortion, early Jewish and Christian teachings condemned it. For example, the Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides and the Sibylline Oracles denounce abortion, indicating the cultural and religious stance against it in antiquity. The Mishnah, a significant Jewish text, allowed abortion only when the mother’s life was at risk, prioritizing maternal life but only up to a specific developmental threshold.

Early Christian writings like the Didache and the Epistle of Barnabas also explicitly condemned abortion, and prominent theologians like Athenagoras, Tertullian, and St. John Chrysostom strongly opposed it. However, opinions on the exact moment life begins varied, with early thinkers like Aristotle and St. Augustine debating the timing of “ensoulment”—or when the soul enters the body. Augustine, while uncertain of the soul’s timing, affirmed the resurrection of unborn children, reflecting a strong pro-life sentiment in traditional Christian thought.

Certain biblical texts are interpreted to support the pro-life position. For instance, Psalm 139 and Jeremiah 1:5 are cited as affirming God’s knowledge and design of individuals from conception, suggesting that life is sacred from its earliest stages. Additionally, Luke’s account of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth’s womb is used to underscore the fetus’s personhood.

The article also addresses translations of Exodus 21:22, which deals with injuries to pregnant women. Differences in translations have led to debate over whether the passage implies a fetus’s lesser value compared to its mother. However, certain interpretations uphold that this text considers fetal life significant, implying accountability for harm done to the unborn.

Finally, the article argues that the Bible consistently defends the rights of the innocent, suggesting that unborn children, as innocents, fall under this protection. Historical consensus among early church figures generally aligned with a strong pro-life stance, although the timing of “ensoulment” remained a theological mystery for some.

In sum, the article argues that both biblical teachings and early Christian tradition advocate a pro-life perspective, viewing the fetus as a fully human and autonomous life from conception, thus meriting the same protections as any other human being.","The article presents a comprehensive analysis of abortion from biological, biblical, historical, and ethical perspectives, advocating a pro-life viewpoint.

Biological Perspective: Pro-life advocates argue that a fetus is an independent, fully human entity from conception, characterized by its ability to respond to stimuli, develop autonomously, and exhibit distinct biological functions, including a heartbeat and brain activity detectable by modern technology.

Biblical and Theological Arguments: While the Bible does not explicitly discuss abortion, several passages imply a strong value on unborn life. Early Jewish and Christian teachings generally condemned abortion. Texts like the Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides, Sibylline Oracles, and the Mishnah highlight cultural opposition to abortion, with the Mishnah permitting it only when the mother’s life is at risk and up to a specific developmental stage. Early Christian documents, such as the Didache and the Epistle of Barnabas, also denounce abortion. Notable theologians, including Athenagoras, Tertullian, and St. John Chrysostom, strongly opposed it. Despite a lack of consensus on the timing of “ensoulment” (as debated by Aristotle and St. Augustine), traditional Christian thought leaned pro-life, viewing the fetus as deserving of moral consideration.

Biblical Interpretations: Certain passages are interpreted to affirm the fetus’s value and personhood. Psalm 139 and Jeremiah 1:5 imply God’s intimate knowledge and design of individuals from conception. Luke’s account of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth’s womb further supports the notion of fetal personhood. Exodus 21:22, addressing harm to a pregnant woman, is interpreted by some to imply accountability for injuries to the fetus, though translations vary on whether it reflects equal value with the mother’s life.

Historical Christian Stance: The historical Christian consensus has generally supported a pro-life stance, advocating for the rights of the innocent and seeing unborn children as part of this protected group. Though early thinkers grappled with the precise moment of ensoulment, they consistently emphasized the sanctity of unborn life.

In summary, the article argues that both biblical texts and early Christian tradition support a pro-life perspective, viewing the fetus as a fully human, autonomous life from conception, meriting legal and moral protections akin to any other human being.","['De', '##S', '##antis', 'DC', 'Ba', 'Florida', 'National Catholic Register', 'Service', 'EWTN News, Inc', 'EWTN News, Inc', 'Catholic', 'Gospel', 'Catholic Church', 'National Catholic Register News Age', 'Catholic News Agency CNA Deutsch ACI Africa ACI Afrique ACI Digital ACI Prens', 'AC', 'Stamp', 'AC', 'Mena Digital Media', '##o', 'Port', '##ug', '##us TV Radio', '##N', '##N', 'Register Radio Vatican', 'Register', 'National Catholic Register', 'Pope Francis', 'E', '##uch', '##aristic', 'Congress Synod', 'Vatican Job Board', 'Register', 'DeSanti', 'DC', 'Ba', 'Florida', 'DeSanti', 'House', 'Bill 5', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Katie', 'Florida', 'Ron', 'Washington', 'Florida', 'Republican', 'Lauren', '##ina']","The article provides a comprehensive examination of abortion from biological, theological, historical, and ethical perspectives, focusing on pro-life arguments.

Biological Perspective: Pro-life advocates argue that a fetus is a distinct, fully human entity from conception. They emphasize that it responds to stimuli, has its own cells, and operates independently of the mother’s biological systems. Modern technology, including the detection of a heartbeat and brain activity, is cited to demonstrate that the fetus is a separate life, deserving legal protection.

Biblical Perspective: While the Bible does not directly address abortion, the article highlights scriptural passages and early religious teachings that condemn it. Early Jewish and Christian texts, such as the Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides and Sibylline Oracles, as well as the Mishnah, suggest the sanctity of life, permitting abortion only when the mother’s life is at risk. Early Christian writings, including the Didache and Epistle of Barnabas, also condemned abortion. Theologians like Athenagoras, Tertullian, and St. John Chrysostom strongly opposed it, though some, like Aristotle and St. Augustine, debated when the soul enters the body, or ensoulment. Augustine affirmed the resurrection of unborn children, reinforcing the pro-life stance.

Scriptural Evidence: Passages such as Psalm 139 and Jeremiah 1:5 are cited to argue that life is sacred from conception, emphasizing God’s knowledge and design of individuals even before birth. The story of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth’s womb (Luke 1:41) is also interpreted as evidence of fetal personhood.

Exodus 21:22 Interpretation: The article discusses different translations of Exodus 21:22, which refers to injuries to pregnant women. While some translations suggest a fetus holds lesser value than the mother, other interpretations argue that fetal life should be treated with similar significance.

Conclusion: The article concludes that both biblical teachings and early Christian traditions consistently support a pro-life view, recognizing the fetus as a fully human life from conception, deserving the same legal protections as other individuals.",R,

Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted about the bill he signed into law on April 14. photo Screenshot from GovRonDeSantis Twitter account last visisted 41522 Katie YoderCNA April 14, 2022 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill protecting the unborn from abortion after 15-weeks gestation on Thursday. During his remarks, he referred to the aborted babies recently found in Washington, D.C. What were doing today is saying that we will not let that happen in the state of Florida, the Republican politician said. Anti-abortion activists Lauren Handy and Terrisa Bukovinac of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising PAAU first told reporters on April 5 that they obtained 115 aborted babies from a driver for a medical-waste company outside a D.C. abortion facility, Washington Surgi-Clinic, with the intention of giving the unborn children a dignified funeral and burial. Five of the babies, who appear to be of late-term gestation, were located by the Metropolitan Police Department MPD on March 30. PAAU says it arranged for the D.C. police to collect and examine the babies, fearing that the babies injuries could be evidence of illegal abortions. Since then, lawmakers have sent multiple letters calling for a full investigation and autopsies of the babies bodies. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has given no indication that the city intends to autopsy the remains. DeSantis addressed what he called a terrible scandal. They found all these remains of babies, and they found five who were basically infants premature, they would have been, but they would have been able to survive outside the womb, he said. Yet Washington, D.C., is treating that just like we would treat the trash from our lunch or something like that. Its really horrifying to see that that could go on in our country, but particularly in our nations capital, he concluded, and he thanked the Daily Wires Mary Margaret Olohan for her coverage of the story. DeSantis signed into law House Bill 5 in Kissimmee, Florida. The legislation bans abortions in that state after an unborn baby reaches 15-weeks gestation, except to save the life or physical health of the mother and in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities. Were here today to defend those who cant defend themselves, DeSantis said. This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation. In addition to providing protections for the unborn, DeSantis highlighted that the legislation expands efforts to reduce fetal-infant mortality cases and works to improve hospitals prenatal care. Previously, Florida law barred abortion after 24 weeks. Pro-life leaders such as Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser praised DeSantis and Florida legislators for the new law. Gov. DeSantis and the Florida Legislature have delivered a milestone victory for women and children, she said in a press release on Thursday. The legislation enacted today may save more than 3,300 lives a year by protecting unborn children, as well as their mothers, from cruel and dangerous late abortions. She concluded, As we await a decision in the Dobbs case, momentum is growing across America to modernize our extreme abortion laws. The new Florida law comes as the Supreme Court prepares to decide a highly anticipated case, Dobbs v. Jackson, which involves a 2018 Mississippi law restricting most abortions after 15 weeks. The case could potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, and leave abortion up to each individual state.

DeSantis emphasized the law’s purpose of protecting the unborn, stating, “We’re here today to defend those who can’t defend themselves.” The law represents a significant shift from Florida’s previous 24-week abortion limit, aiming to reduce fetal and infant mortality and enhance prenatal care.

DeSantis linked the law to a recent discovery in Washington, D.C., where pro-life activists found the remains of 115 aborted babies. Five of the remains were of late-term babies who could have survived outside the womb. DeSantis condemned the situation as a “terrible scandal,” drawing attention to what he viewed as the dehumanization of the unborn in the capital. The discovery of these remains led to calls for investigations and autopsies, though D.C. officials have not agreed to conduct them.

Pro-life advocates, including Marjorie Dannenfelser from the Susan B. Anthony List, praised the new Florida law, which they believe could save thousands of lives each year. The law comes as the U.S. Supreme Court considers the Dobbs v. Jackson case, which could lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and allow individual states to decide on abortion laws. DeSantis’s law reflects the growing momentum among states to impose stricter abortion regulations ahead of this potential ruling.","['UN Women', 'English', '##F', 'UN Women', 'UN', 'Women', 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'Sustainable Development Commission', 'Status', 'of', 'Women', 'UN', 'UN', 'Afghanistan', 'Africa', 'African Girls Can Code Initiative', ""International Women ' s Day"", 'Women', 'Girls UN', 'Women', 'Europe', 'Americas']","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law House Bill 5 on April 14, 2022, which bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation in the state, with exceptions only for saving the life or physical health of the mother or in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities.

The law aims to save lives by reducing late-term abortions and improving prenatal care. Prior to the new legislation, Florida’s law allowed abortions up to 24 weeks. This legislation is seen as a victory for pro-life activists and is particularly significant as it comes at a time when the U.S. Supreme Court was considering the case Dobbs v.

Yet, de-democratization is rarely analysed through the lens of gender equality and, so far, efforts to systematically examine the implications for inclusive democracy and the representation of gender interests are fragmented. Backsliding on gender policies and on state commitments to gender equality, and new forms of feminist engagement with hostile governments and audiences, also raise new challenges to the literature on gender and politics. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to discuss these two interrelated realms backsliding on gender equality policies and the emerging political space for feminist responses to this backsliding.

While the issue of de-democratization is often discussed in political terms, the gendered implications and their effects on inclusive democracy and the representation of gender interests have been insufficiently explored.

In recent years, trends of de-democratization have been observed in Europe and the Americas, where opposition to gender equality is rising, threatening past achievements in gender equality policies. Despite this, gender equality has not been adequately addressed within discussions of de-democratization, and the implications for inclusive democracy and gender representation have not been systematically explored.

The paper proposes a framework to analyze two interconnected issues: the decline of gender equality policies and the political space for feminist responses to this regression. The framework is illustrated with examples from three countries—Croatia, Hungary, and Poland—that have witnessed these challenges in the context of illiberal democracies. The paper is part of the UN Women’s discussion series and aims to enhance understanding of the gendered dimensions of de-democratization and the growing political opportunities for feminist movements under increasingly hostile governments.

The document also emphasizes the importance of feminist engagement in such environments, suggesting a need to adapt strategies for dealing with governments and political audiences that are less supportive of gender equality.

LA Constitution Now Says There Is No Right to Abortion, Prepares for Dismantling of Roe By Jessica Lea - November 5, 2020 ShareTweetPinPocketFlipboard On Nov. 3, the state of Louisiana passed an amendment to its constitution explicitly saying it does not support any inherent right to abortion or funding for abortion. The amendment, which was sponsored by Democratic State Sen. Katrina Jackson, does not impact the legality of abortion or peoples access to it at present. But the amendment appears to be setting the state up to severely restrict access to abortions in the event Roe vs. Wade is overturned. This amendment makes sure there is no right to abortion or taxpayer funding of abortion in our state constitution, said Jackson. By passing this we can rest assured that, together with our state law, we will never become like New York, which recently legalized abortion up to the very moment before birth. Katrina Jacksons Love Life Amendment Passes Amendment 1, or the Love Life Amendment, adds one sentence to the Louisiana state constitution To protect human life, nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion. Voters passed the amendment with 62.06 percent voting in favor of it and 37.94 percent voting against it. Not only was the amendment sponsored by Katrina Jackson, a pro-life Democratic state senator, but it also had the support of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. According to The Hill, Edwards is the only Democratic governor in the U.S. who opposes abortion. In an ad promoting the amendment, Jackson said, Sadly, in other states, judges have imposed their own will by recognizing a right to abortion and the government funding of abortion in their state constitutions. We want to ensure that doesnt happen in the state of Louisiana. By passing the Love Life Amendment, we will ensure that no judge can ever recognize a right to abortion or the state funding of abortion in Louisiana. We will ensure that unborn babies all across the state are protected on the day that Roe vs. Wade is overturned. The amendments website explains that the decision about whether there is a right to abortion in the state of Louisiana should reside in the states legislators and the voters who elect them, rather than in the states courts. The website says that to date, 13 other states have found a right to abortion in their constitutions, which has led to judges striking down pro-life laws and to the taxpayer funding of abortion. It is important to note that the amendment does not make abortion illegal if Roe vs. Wade were to be overturned. Should that happen, the legality of abortion would be determined by state legislators. What the amendment does is provide a basis for legislators to make abortion illegal if they had that opportunity and also gives extra protection to the pro-life laws Louisiana currently has in place. Some have said that the Love Life Amendment is merely a symbolic move and does not really accomplish anything. However, on its Instagram account, Love Life Vote Yes responded to someone who leveled this challenge, saying that the amendment is a defense mechanism that is very much needed while American court systems are consistently legislating from the judicial bench, usurping the legislative process, and forcing abortion-on-demand. In 13 other states, most recently Kansas, wrote the accounts moderator, judges have imposed a right to abortion and the taxpayer funding of abortion even though their state did not allow the funding or have the right to abortion in their state constitutionbecause there is a trend of judges usurping the legislative process and imposing the right to taxpayer funded abortions, we need to be proactive and prevent this from happening. Louisiana Baptist Convention Executive Director Steve Horn said that the passing of the amendment is an important statement from Louisiana voters. Weve been recognized by various groups to be the most pro-life state in the United States. I think this puts an exclamation point on that, and even some hard data, he said. The only other states right now to have added such language to their constitutions are West Virginia and Alabama. State Sen. Katrina Jackson has served in the Louisiana state legislature for nine years, the majority of that time in the House of Representatives. Jackson has spoken at the March for Life rally in Washington D.C. and has called abortion modern-day genocide. Jackson was also the author of a 2014 Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges in local hospitals. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down that law in June of this year. Colorado is another state that sought to limit abortion this election cyclethe state is one of seven that does not impose limits on abortion at any point during pregnancy. Proposition 115 would have banned abortions at 22 weeks with exceptions if the mothers life were at risk, but the measure failed to pass with 59 percent of constituents voting against it.

Sponsored by Democratic State Sen. Katrina Jackson, the amendment is designed to protect Louisiana from potential judicial rulings that could recognize abortion as a constitutional right, similar to what has occurred in 13 other states. While the amendment does not directly impact the legality of abortion, it prepares the state to restrict abortion access should Roe v. Wade be overturned.

The amendment’s supporters, including Governor John Bel Edwards, argue that it ensures Louisiana will not follow states like New York, where abortion is legalized up to birth. The amendment was passed with 62.06% of voters in favor, highlighting the state’s commitment to pro-life values. Jackson emphasized that the amendment is a defense against judicial overreach, where judges in other states have imposed abortion rights and funding, despite state constitutions not supporting them.

This amendment does not make abortion illegal, but it provides a legal foundation for the legislature to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Louisiana’s stance is seen as a proactive move to protect existing pro-life laws, reinforcing its position as one of the most pro-life states in the U.S. The passage of this amendment follows similar actions in West Virginia and Alabama.","['Environment', 'East', 'Southern Africa', 'Angola', 'ReliefW', 'UN OCHA', 'Angola', 'Environment', 'East', 'Southern Africa', 'UNFPA', '##DA', '##UM', 'East', 'Southern Africa', 'UNFPA', '##guard', 'People', 'SADC', 'SADC Parliamentary Forum', 'Malawi', 'Namibia', 'South Africa', 'Zimbabwe', 'SADC Model Law', 'SADC', 'Mozambique', 'Botswana', 'Malawi']","The text discusses the passage of the “Love Life Amendment” in Louisiana on November 3, 2020. The amendment explicitly states that there is no inherent right to abortion or taxpayer funding for abortion in the state constitution. Sponsored by Democratic State Senator Katrina Jackson, a pro-life advocate, the amendment is seen as a proactive measure to prevent the recognition of abortion rights in Louisiana’s state constitution, especially if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.

While the amendment does not immediately change the legality of abortion, it positions Louisiana to restrict abortion if Roe is overturned, as the power to regulate abortion would then revert to state legislators. The amendment was passed with 62% voter support, backed by Governor John Bel Edwards, who is the only Democratic governor in the U.S. opposed to abortion. Critics argue the amendment is symbolic, but supporters believe it is necessary to safeguard against judicial rulings that could recognize abortion rights or funding, as seen in other states.

The amendment’s passage reflects Louisiana’s strong pro-life stance and aims to secure existing pro-life laws, making it harder for future courts to impose abortion rights or taxpayer funding for abortions. Jackson, a prominent pro-life voice in the state, previously authored legislation requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges, though this law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Love Life Amendment aligns Louisiana with other states like Alabama and West Virginia that have added similar language to their constitutions.

The text also briefly contrasts Louisiana’s position with Colorado, where voters rejected a proposition to limit abortions after 22 weeks.",R,
