The decision, made by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, removed the option for women to terminate pregnancies in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, previously a primary reason for legal abortions in the country. This change has led to significant emotional distress for women forced to continue such pregnancies, often amid fears that the child may not survive.

Organizations like Ciocia Basia, a Berlin-based charity, have reported a sharp rise in calls from Polish women looking for help. Abortion Without Borders (AWB), a multinational coalition, has also observed a surge in requests for assistance, particularly as protestors at mass demonstrations against the ruling chanted the coalition’s name and contact information. AWB has already supported more than 40 women in obtaining abortions outside Poland since the ruling—a notable increase from usual numbers.

Supporters of the ruling argue it protects the rights of fetuses with disabilities, seeing the previous law as discriminatory against disabled individuals. Right To Life UK, for example, praised the decision for its validation of individuals with disabilities as valued members of society.

The ban has sparked deep divisions within Poland, leading to widespread protests as people rally against what many view as a step back for women’s rights. This issue highlights broader debates over human rights, disability rights, and reproductive freedoms in the nation."

I AGREE ENGLISH FOR AFRICA Programs Cardinal Tong calls for promoting a culture of life CHURCH Hong Kong protecting life science and technology Coronavirus Hong Kong Cardinal advocates for promoting a culture of life In his message for Pro-Life Day 2020, Cardinal John Tong of Hong Kong urges Christians to promote a culture of life, as the Church marks the 25th anniversary of the encyclical Evangelium Vitae. By Vatican News Cardinal John Tong, the Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong, has invited Christians to revisit the notion of the culture of life. His invitation came in a message ahead of Pro-Life Day 2020, which this year coincides with the 25th anniversary of the promulgation of Pope St. John Paul IIs 1995 encyclical, Evangelium Vitae The Gospel of Life. In the past seven months, noted Cardinal Tong, the pandemic Covid-19 has claimed the lives of over 810,000 persons and infected more than 23.5 million persons worldwide. This disaster drives us to reflect on the values and meaning of life and treasure them more. The encyclical, The Gospel of Life, is meant to be a precise and vigorous reaffirmation of the value of human life and its inviolability, and at the same time, a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God respect, protect, love and serve life, every human life! said Cardinal Tong, citing Evangelium Vitae. Cardinal Tong also explained that the fourth Pro-Life Day was postponed to 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of our Lady, because its original day - the feast of the Visitation - fell on 31 May 2020, which was also Pentecost Sunday. Covid-19 and the culture of death Cardinal Tong noted that, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some countries adopted some policies and attitudes that treated the pandemic lightly like the common flu or by handling it with the approach of herd immunity. These attitudes, he said, devalued our vulnerable brothers and sisters, caused us to neglect our responsibility to care for our brothers and sisters properly, and intensified the impact of the culture of death. Contrasting this with the encyclical Evangelium Vitae, Cardinal Tong said that St. John Paul II invited us to contemplate the meaning of life, its greatness and fantasy, respecting that everyone has a right to life. This reflection should, in turn, lead us to do goodlove and care for others, as the value of a person is not determined by any categories but simply because heshe is a person irrespective of any disability or incapability. He hailed the sacrifice of many priests who, in spite of infection rates, continued to visit coronavirus patients often at the risk of getting infected themselves. They live our Jesuss words, he said, no one has greater love than this, to lay down ones life for ones friends John 15 13. Promoting a new culture of life To foster a new culture of life, the Cardinal stressed on the importance of obeying Gods commandment Thou shall not kill. Obedience to this commandment, he further explained, includes not being angry with our brother, preaching the Gospel of life and supporting all the programmes, organizations and teachings that promote the values of life and serve the gospel of life. In this regard, human life is to be respected and treated as a gift from God, sacred and inviolable from conception to the time of natural death. Consequently, abortion and euthanasia are absolutely unacceptable as the value of life is based on giving and accepting love with the understanding that the conjugal acts of married couples are oriented to the procreation of life. Important also is the formation of conscience, noted the Cardinal, especially as our societies and mass media today are deeply influenced by the culture of death. He pointed out more education needs to be done to nourish a correct conscience in the face of a culture that causes confusion between good and evil, precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life. The role of family Cardinal Tong highlighted the important role of family as a sanctuary of life and the place where the couple welcomes a new life the gift of God. The family is also a place for daily individual and family prayers, to live out the gospel of life and for the special care of the elderly and the sick. In these capacities, he noted, the family has an indispensable role in fostering the culture of life. Science, technology in service of human life Cardinal Tong said that science and technology can be used in the service of human life and its integrity, insisting that advancements in biotechnology need to be understood in order to be used for the promotion and protection of life. In this regard, he acknowledged the role of the Bioethics Resource Center of the Holy Spirit Seminary College of Theology and Philosophy, the Diocesan Pastoral Commission for Marriage and Family, and Catholic schools which identify life as one of their core educational values. He also recommended the Creighton Model Fertility Care System for couples who are having difficulties in achieving pregnancies and natural family planning services for couples preparing to have children. Pointing out that contemporary society is torn between a culture of life and a culture of death, Cardinal Tong called for critical thinking that is capable of discerning true values and authentic needs to build a culture of life. In conclusion, he urged everyone to love and respect every human life, walk forward patiently and courageously, to foster the culture of life which is the fruit of truth and love.

Cardinal Tong highlighted the COVID-19 pandemic as a stark reminder of life’s fragility and underscored that approaches treating the virus lightly or favoring herd immunity reflect a disregard for vulnerable individuals, intensifying a “culture of death.”

Cardinal Tong called for a renewed commitment to the encyclical’s teachings, urging respect for all human life as inherently valuable, regardless of disabilities or vulnerabilities. He praised those who risked their lives, including priests, to support COVID-19 patients, embodying Jesus’s call to “lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” He argued that this “culture of life” is supported by adhering to commandments like “Thou shall not kill,” which extend beyond physical harm to include nurturing respect, promoting life values, and opposing abortion and euthanasia.

The Cardinal emphasized that family plays a critical role in this culture by welcoming new life, caring for the elderly, and fostering values that respect the sanctity of life. He also pointed to the positive role of science and technology, which, when guided by ethical principles, can support human dignity and life. Educational initiatives, like those provided by Catholic institutions and bioethics centers, help nurture a conscientious respect for life.

Concluding his message, Cardinal Tong urged society to respect and cherish every human life, advancing the culture of life through truth, love, and a commitment to human dignity from conception to natural death."

Quality sex education can lead to better prevention in STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Furthermore, it decreases the risks of having unsafe sex and increases responsible family planning. To help address issues, like overpopulation, high rates of teen pregnancy and the rise of HIV, the Philippines is gradually implementing sex education and accessibility to contraceptives. Reproductive Health Act The Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 RH Act after a 14-year wait. Through the act, the government integrated sex education into the public school curriculum for students ages 10 to 19. The Philippines also gave funding for free or subsidized contraceptives at health centers and public schools. The government passed the RH Act in response to the many health issues impacting the country, such as infant mortality, pregnancy-related deaths and a rise in HIVAIDS cases. Moreover, teen pregnancies in the Philippines are common, where 9 of women between the ages of 15 and 19 start child bearing. Lack of knowledge about reproductive health is significantly associated with poverty, especially in regard to overpopulation. Therefore, the RH Act aims to help the population make informed decisions about their reproductive health. It provides more equal access to sex education, while also ensuring that the government reaffirms its commitment to protecting womens reproductive rights, providing accessible family planning information, and hiring skilled maternal health professionals to work in both urban and rural areas of the Philippines. Opposition from the Catholic Church Around 80 of the Philippine population identifies as Roman Catholic. Accordingly, the Catholic Church largely influences the state of sex education in the country. The Catholic Church opposes sex outside of marriage and fears sex education will increase sexual relations. The Catholic Church consequently remains critical of the RH Act, increasing difficulties in putting the RH Act into concrete action. Additionally, the Catholic Church opposes implementing sex education in schools as well as the distribution of contraceptives. The Church prefers to rely on parents to teach their kids about reproductive health. However, many families are either unequipped to do so or will not address the subject directly with their children. The Implementation of the RH Act In an effort to reduce the countrys rate of poverty, Philippine President, Rodrigo Duerte, ordered the government to provide access to free contraceptives for six million women in 2017. Duerte aimed to fulfill unmet family planning needs. This came after a restraining order was placed on the RH Act in 2015. However, the government appealed to lift the restraining order to continue applying the RH Act and addressing issues due to overpopulation. In 2019, Save the Children Philippines an organization with the purpose of supporting Filipino children advocated for the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention bill. The organization also fought for requiring schools to fully integrate Comprehensive Sexuality Education CSE into their curriculum. Save the Children Philippines hopes to combat the countrys high rate of teen pregnancy. CSE in the Philippines includes topics such as consent, sexual violence, contraceptives and others. The bill would also advance access to reproductive health services, further supplementing the goals of the RH Act. Increased Conversation Surrounding Sex Education In addition to greater governmental action, there are various organizations that are working to increase access to sex education and services in the Philippines. The Roots of Health is a nongovernmental organization that provides sex education to women in Palawan and Puerto Princesa. Started in 2009, the founders, Dr. Susan Evangelista and Amina Evangelista Swanepoel, initially provided reproductive health classes at Palawan State University in Puerto Princesa and have since expanded into free clinical services for young women. The Roots of Health provides services that assist with birth, reproductive healthcare, contraceptives, prenatal and postpartum check-ups, and ultrasounds. By 2018, they served 20,000 women and adolescents in the Palawan and Puerto Princesa communities, demonstrating that there is a growing grassroots movement towards reframing reproductive health in the Philippines. Sex education will remain a controversial subject in the Philippines. Nonetheless, it is a developing matter that is expected to evolve with continued conversations between governmental, faith and nongovernmental actors.

To address these health concerns and issues such as overpopulation and high teen pregnancy rates, the Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act (RH Act) in 2012. This act, after a 14-year legislative battle, mandated sex education in public schools for children ages 10-19 and provided government funding for free or subsidized contraceptives at health centers and schools. The RH Act aims to promote informed decisions on reproductive health and reduce health risks associated with poverty, especially in high-population areas.

The implementation of the RH Act has faced significant resistance from the Catholic Church, which holds substantial influence in the predominantly Catholic nation. The Church opposes premarital sex and fears that sex education could encourage sexual activity. Instead, the Church supports parental guidance over school-based sex education. However, this often leaves many young people without adequate information on reproductive health.

Despite resistance, the Philippine government and several organizations continue to support sex education. In 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered free access to contraceptives for six million women to meet family planning needs, countering a temporary restraining order placed on the RH Act in 2015. Save the Children Philippines also supported the integration of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in schools through the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention bill, covering topics like consent, contraceptive use, and sexual violence.

Grassroots organizations like Roots of Health have also contributed to increasing access to reproductive health services. Founded in 2009, Roots of Health offers reproductive health education and free clinical services, including birth support, contraceptive access, and prenatal care in communities like Palawan and Puerto Princesa.

While sex education remains a contentious issue, ongoing efforts from the government, NGOs, and advocates are paving the way for its gradual acceptance and potential expansion in the Philippines."

She had been feeling so great that she hadnt felt the need to bring her husband along to her 20-week scan in late November of last year, a few weeks after they publicly announced the pregnancy.But as the scan went on, St.Michel, who is a chiropractor, started to suspect that her fetuss arms looked a little off. The technician left the room, promising to return with the offices fetal medicine specialist.Anti-choice states arent satisfied. Now they want to punish traveling for abortions Moira DoneganRead moreThen St.Michel waited. And waited. She took a look at the fetuss vitals, still displayed on the screen, and many of the measurements were below 1. St.Michel started to get worried.Around 20 minutes later, the fetal medicine specialist walked in, along with someone else. The specialist introduced herself, and then told St.Michel that her colleague was a genetic counselor.Thats when St.Michel knew something was very, very wrong.The providers recommended that St.Michel call her husband to come to the appointment. After he arrived, they delivered the news the couples fetus had multiple severe genetic and developmental conditions affecting multiple organ systems. If the fetus survived to birth, the baby would immediately need palliative care.St.Michel could consult more specialists, continue the pregnancy a decision that, she later learned, could threaten her health or get an abortion. But she could not get the abortion in the state the procedure is banned in almost all circumstances in Idaho.Basically, all they could do was hand us a sheet of paper with abortion clinics in nearby states, St.Michel told the Guardian in an interview, as she started to cry.St.Michel is one of four women who, on Tuesday, sued Idaho in an attempt to clarify the states abortion ban and allow doctors to perform abortions in cases like hers. Two doctors and the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians have joined the lawsuit, which was brought on the plaintiffs behalf by the Center for Reproductive Rights.Idahos abortion bans have sown confusion, fear, and chaos among the medical community, resulting in grave harms to pregnant patients whose health and safety hang in the balance across the state, the lawsuit alleges. While Idahos abortion bans purport to contain medical exceptions, these so-called exceptions simply do not function as such in practice.Since the overturning of Roe v Wade allowed abortion bans across the country to take effect, doctors in Idaho and other states have said that the bans so-called medical exceptions are worded in opaque, non-medical language that they find impossible to interpret. These exceptions, they say, have forced them to merely watch until patients get sick enough that doctors can legally help.Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights also filed legal actions on Tuesday in Tennessee and Oklahoma, which have enacted near-total abortion bans, demanding specificity on how abortions should be handled in medical emergencies. The center has previously sued over the issue in Texas a judge in that case ruled in favor of the women denied care, but that decision has been paused while the case makes its way to the Texas supreme court.Idaho has one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country, Marc Hearron, the centers senior counsel, said on a press call on Tuesday. While some states allow abortions when peoples health may be at risk, Idaho does not. Under its near-total ban, abortions can only be performed when someones life is threatened.Doctors have started to flee Idaho in droves, and the state could soon find itself a pregnancy care desert. At least 13 reproductive health specialists and four fetal medicine specialists have stopped practicing in Idaho, Dr Emily Corrigan, one of the Idaho doctors involved in the lawsuit, wrote in a June article for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Two rural labor and delivery units have also closed.Our medical community here in Idaho is experiencing catastrophic loss that is going to take decades to fix once we get these laws improved. Were still in a terrible downward spiral right now, Corrigan told reporters on Tuesday. I have hope that the legislature will improve the law. Thats why Im still here. But I have to ask myself every single day if its worth it to stay here.After she got the news about the fetus, St.Michel called out of work for the rest of the week, she told the Guardian. She supports abortion rights, but hadnt thought she would ever need an abortion.Still, she decided she wanted one.At that point, I was feeling baby movement, fetal movement, St.Michel said. It was really difficult to think of continuing on and trying to pretend like normal life was happening for us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She and her husband brought their toddler daughter with them.While the providers at the clinic were kind, St.Michel felt like she had been forced to suffer alone her husband couldnt come inside, and her care team was back in Idaho. During the appointment, she clutched a grainy ultrasound photo of her fetus, she recalled. It is the only photo she has.Among booking flights, a hotel room and a rental car, and the two-day procedure itself, St.Michel estimates that she and her husband spent between 3,500 and 4,000 ending her pregnancy.Im so, so grateful to them, to the clinic and how much compassion they showed me. But it still wasnt fair, she said That I had to be in that room by myself grieving for the loss of a pregnancy that we wanted so badly.Once they returned to Idaho, St.Michel told many people only that her family had experienced a loss.But months later, she no longer feels like she should keep what happened a secret.It wasnt a shameful thing that we did, she said. It almost feels liberating to share the truth, to share our experience, because I do want people to know how these laws are affecting women across the country.View image in fullscreenSt.Michel with her husband and child. Photograph Courtesy of Jillaine StMichelAfter the abortion, St.Michel and her husband debated whether to try for another baby. St.Michel did get pregnant again, and is due in January 2024, but the experience of being pregnant again is nerve-racking.What if something happens again? What if Im put in this situation again? she wondered. What if this time is worse and my life is at more imminent danger? Where does that leave us?St.Michel and her husband have weighed leaving the state. They love living in Idaho, but she cant ignore the burgeoning political climate in the Republican-dominated state. She wants to give her daughter a more compassionate upbringing and shes not sure if life in Idaho can provide that.St.Michel wears a diamond necklace every day, because diamond is the birthstone for April which would have been her due date. St.Michels daughter is too young to understand what happened, she said, but she sometimes picks up the necklace and asks about the fetus that would have been her sibling.Hopefully, when shes of age to comprehend some of this, things will be different here. Hopefully, this little case will be a thing of the past and Ill be able to say, Because of what happened, we were able to make changes for the better in this state, St.Michel said of her daughter. I hope someday shes proud of me for that.Explore more on these topicsAbortionIdahoReproductive rightsRoe v WadeHealthWomenfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Her fetus, as an ultrasound revealed, had multiple genetic and developmental issues, and would likely not survive after birth without immediate palliative care. Idaho’s strict abortion ban, which only allows abortions if the mother’s life is in danger, left her with no option for an in-state abortion, despite the significant health risks posed by continuing the pregnancy. St. Michel was advised to seek abortion care out of state and eventually traveled to Washington with her husband and daughter, where she paid between $3,500 and $4,000 for the procedure. The experience was isolating—she could not have her husband present during the procedure, and her Idaho-based healthcare team could not assist her.

St. Michel is now one of four women suing Idaho over its abortion ban, seeking clarification on the law to enable doctors to perform abortions in medically necessary situations. The lawsuit, supported by the Center for Reproductive Rights, argues that Idaho’s ambiguous medical exceptions cause confusion and harm, as healthcare providers struggle to interpret the law and fear legal repercussions. Additionally, Idaho’s restrictive policies are pushing healthcare professionals, particularly reproductive specialists, to leave the state, creating a growing crisis in pregnancy care access.

St. Michel, now expecting another child, lives in anxiety over potential complications that could arise under Idaho’s restrictive laws. She and her husband have considered leaving Idaho due to its political climate, though they love their community. She wears a diamond necklace—a symbol of the pregnancy she lost—and hopes her lawsuit will lead to change, allowing her daughter to grow up in a more compassionate society."

In the face of this global health crisis, Canadas approach, guided by the Feminist International Assistance Policy FIAP, is crucial in ensuring a feminist and human-rights based response to COVID-19 that recognizes the gendered impacts of the pandemic and the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR at this time. Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights encourages the Government of Canada to ensure an integrated response to the virus that includes SRHR, with a particular focus on the neglected areas of SRHR, including abortion access, comprehensive contraceptive care, SRHR for adolescents and youth, including comprehensive sexuality education, and advocacy for SRHR. Sexual and reproductive health and rights underpin gender equality and are pivotal to good health. Evidence shows that when women are denied access to contraception, safe abortion and post-abortion care, maternal mortality rates rise. SRHR services are essential health care and must be accessible. A continued focus on the neglected areas of SRHR must also be part of the global response to COVID-19. In the FIAP, the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of access to SRHR for women and girls in its humanitarian response. In the face of a global health crisis, it is time to action the policy and ensure that the needs of women and girls in the most underfunded and overlooked areas are a priority in the global response. A feminist approach to the pandemic includes addressing the unique impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized groups, including women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, people living with disabilities, the working poor, those already living in emergency and humanitarian settings, and many others who face discrimination and barriers to resources, healthcare, and social services. In times of crisis, these inequalities are exacerbated and compounded by new and additional hardships such as greater economic instability, increased gender-based violence GBV, and higher rates of unplanned pregnancies. Further, with women disproportionately represented on the frontlines of the pandemic as health workers and in caregiving role, women have an increased risk of contracting the virus. Why do the neglected areas of SRHR need to be prioritized in the global response to COVID-19? Access to contraception The demand for contraceptives does not change during times of crisis. However, mass disruptions to supply chains and the diversion of supplies to the COVID-19 response create new and additional barriers to access. Supply chain disruption applies to various forms of contraceptives including birth control pills, condoms, and devices, as well as access to emergency contraception. It is imperative that these basic and essential commodities be available and accessible throughout the pandemic. Without decreased access to contraception, it is expected that unplanned pregnancies will increase in the coming months, putting further strain on health systems and increasing demand for abortion. Other ways to increase access to contraception include easing administrative barriers. This includes not requiring a prescription, allowing contraceptives to be prescribed via telemedicine, allowing pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives, and by providing comprehensive cost coverage. In addition to contraception, supply chain disruption could have an effect on other SRHR related drugs, including antiretrovirals for those living with HIV, medical abortion pills, and antibiotics and other medications used to treat sexually transmitted infections. Safe abortion Abortion is an essential and time-sensitive procedure. However, in emergencies, it is often deprioritized, delayed or not offered at all as health systems are stretched thin and supplies and human resources are directed elsewhere. Lockdowns, social distancing and increased barriers to travel during the pandemic make it even harder for pregnant people to access abortion. Unfortunately, where safe abortion is not readily accessible, people will turn to unsafe abortion. Supply chain disruptions can also affect access to medical abortion also known as the abortion pill. A safe method to terminate pregnancy that requires minimal travel or exposure to the virus, many advocates and medical professionals are pushing for expanded access to medical abortion e.g. by removing legal and administrative barrier, allowing its use up to 12 weeks, and allowing prescriptions via telemedicine. SRHR for adolescents and youth The pandemic has forced the closure of schools in many countries, leaving billions of children and youth without access to education. Learning from past humanitarian crises, these interruptions can lead to increased drop-out rates, which disproportionately affects adolescent girls by furthering gender gaps in education and leading to increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy, and early and forced marriage. Outside of school, the caregiving burdens on young women and adolescents may increase. They may also lose access to health and hygiene services or products that are often offered through schools. The closure of schools also means that young people are being denied life-saving comprehensive sexuality education CSE. CSE is a key intervention to prevent childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence. When delivered properly, CSE can address persistent stigma, prejudice, and discrimination against the LGBTQI2S community and reduce homophobic and transphobic violence. This is critical knowledge that enables children and youth to keep themselves healthy and safe and should be accessible to all, even in times of crisis. Advocacy for SRHR Communities must be central in the COVID-19 response. Local mobilizers and organizations best know their communitys needs, including the unique needs of women, girls, LGBTQI2S persons, and other vulnerable groups. Feminist, womens rights and youth organizations should be supported and meaningfully included in policymaking at all levels in the response to COVID-19, and in program design, delivery and monitoring. Amid government efforts to control movement and limit the spread of the virus, there has been an uptick in surveillance, censorship, and criminalization, putting civil liberties at risk. Human rights defenders drawing attention to these abuses, including health care workers, journalists, and other whistleblowers must be protected. Another threat to access to SRHR includes ideological attacks by policymakers using the pandemic to push through laws and restrictions that violate human rights. This includes everything from abortion restrictions to attacks on trans rights. As we face this unprecedented global health crisis, we urge Canada to maintain its global feminist leadership and commitment to SRHR in its international assistance. This means a continued focus on the most neglected areas of SRHR at a time pf heightened inequality to ensure uninterrupted access to these essential and lifesaving SRHR services.

Follow Us Movements we're a part of Action Canada Associate Organization Network Canadian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development Contraception and Abortion Research Team Cooperation Canada Future Planning Initiative Sexual Rights Initiative Copyright Action Canada SHR Privacy Policy Sitemap","The policy brief from Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights emphasizes Canada’s need to integrate neglected areas of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) into its COVID-19 global response. Under the guidance of Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP), this approach would support a gender-sensitive and human rights-based response to the pandemic. This integration is crucial for addressing the pandemic’s gendered impacts, which disproportionately affect women, girls, LGBTQI2S individuals, and marginalized communities facing increased barriers to healthcare and essential services.

Key SRHR areas highlighted include access to contraception, safe abortion, and youth-focused sexual education. Disruptions in supply chains due to the pandemic have severely limited access to contraceptives, emergency contraception, and other essential medications. Action Canada urges policy changes to streamline contraceptive access, including telemedicine prescriptions and eased pharmacy restrictions. This is necessary to prevent the likely increase in unplanned pregnancies and associated health risks.

The brief also stresses the importance of maintaining access to safe abortion services during the pandemic, as delays and restrictions push people toward unsafe alternatives. To address this, it recommends allowing medical abortion via telemedicine and removing legal barriers to expand safe abortion access.

For adolescents and youth, the pandemic has limited access to comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) due to school closures. CSE is essential for preventing sexual exploitation, violence, and early marriage, particularly for young girls who are at increased risk due to higher dropout rates during crises. Action Canada underscores the role of CSE in educating youth on gender equality, LGBTQI2S rights, and sexual health.

Action Canada advocates for community involvement in Canada’s global COVID-19 response, highlighting the importance of supporting local feminist organizations and protecting human rights defenders facing increased surveillance and censorship. The brief warns against policymakers who use the pandemic to restrict SRHR or impose ideologically driven limitations, such as abortion restrictions and attacks on transgender rights.

In conclusion, Action Canada calls for sustained support for SRHR in Canada’s COVID-19 response, focusing on vulnerable groups and ensuring uninterrupted access to essential SRHR services during this time of heightened inequality. This comprehensive response is framed as crucial to upholding Canada’s commitment to gender equality and human rights in the global pandemic response."

Wade anniversary Groups gear up for pivotal year with emphasis on states Both sides of the abortion debate have been energized by the recent implementation of the Texas abortion ban that prohibits almost all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. Bill ClarkCQ Roll Call file photo By Sandhya Raman Posted January 22, 2020 at 600am Facebook Twitter Email Reddit Groups pushing for the advancement of abortion rights and those looking to limit the procedure have an ambitious agenda starting this week, foreshadowing a year that could be critical for advocates on both sides of the debate.In two months, the Supreme Court will hear its first major abortion case since 2016, and both sides are revving up for a major presidential election. States are also eyeing a number of new reproductive health bills as their legislatures come back into session.Lawmakers urge Supreme Court to reexamine abortion decisionsA flurry of legislation timed around the Jan. 22 anniversary of the landmark 1973 abortion rights case Roe v. Wade and the largest annual anti-abortion rally, known as the March for Life, is typical in most years. But with a split Congress and impeachment proceedings pending in the Republican-controlled Senate, this years activity will focus more on motivating supporters to prepare for upcoming fights over state policies, court cases and elections.Kristan Hawkins, president of the anti-abortion Students for Life of America group, envisions renewed energy beginning this week, stemming in part from the 2020 campaign season.Theres a general feeling that most people would agree that this is going to be a pivotal year when we talk about abortion in our country, she said. Loading the player. Upcoming events More than 100,000 abortion opponents are expected to rally for the March for Life on Jan. 24, with a 3,000-person conference scheduled the following day aimed at training abortion opponents to mobilize. In recent years, the president and vice president spoke at the March for Life. Top administration officials are expected to make an appearance this year as well.Last year, the march was timed for the week of a Senate procedural vote to codify a ban on taxpayer-funded abortion, the announcement of a newly formed Senate Pro-Life Caucus and a letter from President Donald Trump to Speaker Nancy Pelosi promising to veto any abortion rights legislation.Anti-abortion advocates want to see movement on their key policy priority legislation that they argue would protect an infant who survives an attempted abortion.Grassroots groups prepare for a post-Roe v. Wade AmericaJeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, expects the call to action this year to be related to a House discharge petition to require a vote on this bill. Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, who sponsored the House version, is slated to speak at the march, as are other GOP lawmakers and Louisiana Democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson, who wrote the law that the Supreme Court will hear in March.Another priority, according to Hawkins, is targeting Planned Parenthood funding.I know several people who have reached out to various people at the administration to talk about debarment of Planned Parenthood, she said.The Department of Health and Human Services is able to temporarily block federal funds to an organization in cases of fraud or other illegal activity. State and court battles Legislative and legal action on both abortion bans and the expansion of abortion rights is also expected to heat up.In 2019, seven states passed near-total abortion bans, none of which is in effect because of litigation. The ACLU said two of those cases, Mississippi and Missouri, could see appeals court arguments in the next couple of months.The million-dollar question is whether the Supreme Court will step in to review one of these cases, said Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Its too late for that to happen this term. So the earliest wed really be looking at is 2021, and its unclear whether the Supreme Court has the appetite to jump into that question right away.Jessica Arons, senior advocacy and policy counsel for reproductive freedom at the American Civil Liberties Union, also sees state policy changes as an often-overlooked issue.While a high-stakes showdown will be playing out at the Supreme Court, we should not take our eyes off of what is happening in the states, she told reporters last week. Already, bills that would ban abortion from the earliest days of pregnancy, like those passed in Georgia and Alabama last year, have been introduced in 10 states, with more likely to be filed in the coming days. This year, there is a genuine risk that at least five more abortion bans could be enacted, Arons said.Arons and other abortion rights supporters are also watching court cases besides the Supreme Court case in March, which will determine whether a Louisiana law that would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital can go into effect.The ACLU is watching at least two other types of cases that could make their way to the high court next year. One type is cases targeting a method of abortion known as dilation and evacuation. Laws in Kentucky, Arkansas and Ohio were blocked by lower courts but have been appealed.The other type challenges restrictions that would ban abortions based on a reason, such as a fetal anomaly. In March, the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on an Ohio law. Election 2020 Both sides are doubling down on grassroots efforts to energize voters who share their beliefs about abortion.A majority of Americans do not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned, according to a poll released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. About 91 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents do not want the decision to be reversed, while 57 percent of Republicans do want it overturned. However, only 6 percent of Democrats and 7 percent of Republicans consider reproductive health to be their top campaign issue, the poll found.Abortion may get more attention this year, though, in states like Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Michigan, which might have ballot initiatives this cycle that could roll back abortion rights.Progressive groups are also on the offense, building on the success of enacting state legislation in places like New York last year. For instance, Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and others are backing a Massachusetts bill that would allow access to abortion later in pregnancy and loosen parental consent restrictions for minors.Last week, Planned Parenthood announced a new voter program, We Decide 2020, that provides voter information about candidates reproductive health stances. The new program launched with a five-figure digital buy in battleground states. Planned Parenthood previously announced plans to spend 45 million on this election.Our country is at a crossroads, but now its time for us to reclaim our power, said Jenny Lawson, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes. In 2020, were fighting back and electing reproductive champions up and down the ballot because our futures depend on it.On the other side of the debate, Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, announced Friday that it would dramatically expand its grassroots efforts. Volunteers were already talking to voters in Arizona, Florida and North Carolina but also will be targeting Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Theyve also increased their budget to 52 million this cycle.Mallory Quigley, national spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PACs independent expenditure campaign, said they will also target traditional Democratic voter groups.Our focused, battle-tested voter outreach method will ensure we reach the voters who can provide President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates the winning margin, she said.You may not always agree with what the president tweets out, Hawkins said. You may not agree with every policy he has, or any other politician, but you always know when we vote, we think about what is the most pressing issue. You have to vote for the candidate thats going to do the most to limit abortion.

Copyright 2023 CQ Roll Call. All rights reserved. X","As the anniversary of Roe v. Wade approaches, the abortion debate intensifies, with advocacy groups from both sides preparing for a critical year in 2020. The enactment of Texas’ six-week abortion ban has fueled activism, coinciding with the Supreme Court’s upcoming review of a Louisiana law on abortion provider hospital privileges. Both sides anticipate the importance of the 2020 election and have ramped up grassroots and legislative efforts.

Key events include the March for Life rally and an anti-abortion training conference, expected to gather over 100,000 participants. Anti-abortion advocates aim to advance legislation focused on protecting infants who survive abortion attempts and seek to defund Planned Parenthood, which could lose federal funding if accused of illegal activity. Additionally, state-level restrictions and new reproductive health bills are in focus, with several states likely to pass more abortion bans this year.

Court battles continue, with cases in Mississippi and Missouri potentially advancing to higher courts. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are monitoring new laws that challenge Roe v. Wade’s protections, including restrictions on abortion methods and bans based on fetal anomalies. In the election arena, both sides aim to mobilize voters. Polls show strong public support for Roe v. Wade, with a majority of Democrats and independents opposing its overturn. Yet, while abortion isn’t the top campaign priority for most voters, the issue is gaining traction in key battleground states with ballot initiatives and candidate endorsements.

Progressive organizations like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are backing state initiatives to expand abortion access, such as Massachusetts’ proposal to allow later-term abortions and ease parental consent for minors. Planned Parenthood has also launched a voter initiative, We Decide 2020, aimed at informing voters about candidates’ reproductive health stances. Conversely, anti-abortion groups, led by the Susan B. Anthony List, have expanded outreach in swing states, focusing on traditional Democratic demographics to bolster support for President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates.

With both sides significantly increasing their campaign budgets, the 2020 election is set to be pivotal for abortion rights in America, reflecting deep divides and the potential for sweeping policy changes at both the state and federal levels."

Over the past two weeks, more than 100 posters have been distributed in the streets of Szczecin, considered one of Polands most liberal cities, as part of a project by the TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art.On 22 October, Poland's constitutional court ruled that abortion is illegal even in cases where there are severe foetal abnormalities. Almost all of the country's 1,000 legal terminations a year are carried out for this reason under the new law, abortions can only be carried out in instances of rape, incest and when the mother's life is at risk. Andrzeh GolcKruger tells The Art Newspaper she has been riveted by the hugely brave protests in Poland, compelling her to revisit her poster project from many years ago. The US artist says The urgent and brave protesting of marginalised, disempowered and newly empowered bodies is an insistent threat to the dominant and extremist choreographies of religion, power, and politics in Poland. The brazen hypocrisy of the Church and its predictable fist bumping with the political right make for a grotesque dance of male bonding and resolute abuse of power.Kruger originally made the graphic work of a woman with a bisected face for the Womens March in Washington DC in 1989, which had been organised because the Republicans were trying to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 ruling which made abortion legal in the US.Two years later, in 1991, when womens rights were also under attack in Poland, it was translated into Polish and 500 posters were distributed throughout Warsaw. The images only lasted one weekend before being torn down or covered up. Six months later, a Polish feminist group agreed to distribute the posters once more, pasting the works in hard-to-reach spots and ensuring the image became part of Polish history. Andrzej GolcMilada Slizinska, then the curator of the Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw, was instrumental in bringing Krugers campaign to Poland in the 1990s. Speaking to the Gentlewoman magazine earlier this year, Slizinska describes how womens rights were being eroded. She says When Solidarity came to power in 1989, all of a sudden, the rules against sexual education and abortion became stronger and stronger. The political climate had unexpectedly turned against womens rights, so I asked Barbara to work with us. This is where our problems started.Slizinska recalls how the museum's budget came from the minister of culture, and our director was too scared to fund the printing and distribution of Barbaras poster. Furthermore, Kruger refused to let the American embassy pay for her flight, so Slizinska booked the US artist to give a lecture in Warsaw and was able to pay for her that way. Stanislaw Ruksza, the director of TRAFO, also remembers the impact of Krugers project. Back then, I was a teenager, but I remember the posters were one of the first works in the Polish public space of the transformation era that got a reaction from passers-by. It was the beginning ofor perhaps an impulse forfurther important public works in Poland, he says. Ruksza notes how Krugers posters had a lasting impact on Polish artists during the late 1990s including Krzysztof Wodiczko, Artur Zmijewski, Katarzyna Kozyra and Pawel Althamerall of whom have provided a powerful commentary on the Polish reality and, frequently, openly confronted the conservative discourse.As for the seeming lack of progress over the past 30 years, Kruger says she is not at all surprised that the struggle for womens reproductive freedom is constant and ongoing. She adds The need to control minds and bodies and to destroy difference has been horrifically acted out across centuries and continents. Contestations around gender, race, and class loom larger now than ever.The emergence of Donald Trump in the US signals a consolidation of the forces of rage, shaming, and revenge and speaks not only to the gathering global wave of autocratic rule but also to the failures of some of the lefts weak rhetorical skills and pathetic inability to read the room, Kruger says.And added to these challenges and inequities is the horrific fact that we are living and dying amidst the looming tragedies of a planetary pandemic in which some are more insulated than others.

Originally created in 1989 for the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., the work was made in response to threats against Roe v. Wade and features a bisected image of a woman’s face, symbolizing the struggle for women’s rights. The poster first appeared in Poland in 1991, during another period of conservative opposition to women’s reproductive rights, but was quickly torn down, with a Polish feminist group later redistributing it in more inaccessible locations to preserve its impact.

Now, nearly 30 years later, TRAFO Center for Contemporary Art has reintroduced Kruger’s poster to the streets of Szczecin in response to Poland’s 2020 constitutional court ruling that bans abortion even in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. This new law restricts abortion to cases of rape, incest, or risk to the mother’s life, a decision that has triggered widespread protests, especially in urban, liberal areas like Szczecin. Kruger supports the protesters, highlighting the ongoing, global fight against patriarchal forces that seek control over marginalized bodies.

Milada Slizinska, a key figure in bringing Kruger’s work to Poland in the early 90s, recalls the difficulties faced, including censorship from government-funded institutions and a lack of financial support. Kruger’s work has since left a lasting impact on Polish public art, influencing notable artists like Krzysztof Wodiczko and Katarzyna Kozyra, who have critiqued Poland’s conservative climate through their work.

Kruger comments on the persistence of restrictive policies around reproductive rights, seeing it as part of a broader struggle for bodily autonomy that spans gender, race, and class issues. She also draws parallels with the political climate in the U.S., pointing to a global trend toward autocratic governance and failures of liberal movements to effectively counter this. Kruger’s poster thus remains a powerful symbol in Poland’s ongoing fight for women’s rights and broader social justice."
Abortion 'practically banned in Turkey',"Abortion 'practically banned in Turkey' Turkey's own independent gazette Podcast Women Economy Human Rights Politics Education Columns Galleries Videos Abortion is practically banned in Turkey, an academic who has been working on the issue has said, adding that majority of the public hospitals don't carry out abortion surgeries. According to Sedef Erkmen, public hospitals in 53 provinces don't carry out the said surgeries upon women's wills, while certain doctors do so in a limited amount of hospitals in the remaining provinces. Sunday August 16 2020 0209 pm rfan Aktan DUVARAbortion is practically banned in Turkey, an academic who has been working on the issue has said, adding that majority of the public hospitals don't carry out abortion surgeries. Sedef Erkmen, who recently published a book on the subject, told Duvar that the anti-abortion practices that have been systematically implemented since 2012 turned into a de facto ban. According to Erkmen, public hospitals in 53 provinces don't carry out the said surgeries upon women's wills, while certain doctors do so in a limited amount of hospitals in the remaining provinces. Sedef Erkmen.Abortion became legal in Turkey in 1983 following a years-long ban, but the de facto ban began under the ruling Justice and Development Party AKP, whose leader President Recep Tayyip Erdoan has deemed it ""murder"" in the past. Erkmen said that on-demand abortion is legal for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, but women face numerous obstacles in practice.Turkey's top court orders state to pay 100,000 liras over denial of abortion to rape victim""Since the understanding that abortion is murder is imposed by the government, some doctors don't carry out surgeries despite it being against the law. They know that they will be protected by the government if women complain about it,"" Erkmen said. ""It's not easy for women to take the issue to courts. Besides, women are usually referred to private hospitals from public ones,"" she added. No access to birth control, high prices lead to abortionsErkmen noted that one of the leading factors that women seek abortions is the difficulty in accessing birth control methods.""Because the state doesn't make it easy for people to access birth control methods and because they are very expensive, women, especially impoverished ones, seek abortion. The high prices lead to unwanted pregnancies, but they also face difficulties in abortion so the problem keeps growing,"" Erkmen said. If a practice is legal, it also has to be accessible, Erkmen said, adding that abortion surgeries are also very expensive in private hospitals. Erkmen cited a study by Kadir Has University conducted in 2016, which showed that only 7.8 percent of 431 state hospitals are carrying out abortions upon will. Some 11.8 percent of the state hospitals are not conducting the said surgeries, according to the study. Ankara police attack and detain women rallying for Istanbul ConventionErkmen said that the practical ban on abortions can't be explained with the AKP's population policies. ""It can be seen that the AKP has been using anti-abortion discourse as part of its efforts to control women in all ways,"" she said, adding that the government's discourse on family values dates back to 2007. ""The family is very important for the AKP. That's why it had to choose policies that protect the family instead of women. For it to reach its 'ideal society,' women need to be a part of a family,"" Erkmen also said. Women use methods that endanger their lives Saying that women who can't access abortion choose methods that endanger their lives, Erkmen noted that women have to get a written permission from their husbands for an operation. ""For single women, the biggest fear is to be going under record. Health officials visit you at your house if you find out that you're pregnant with a test at a doctor's office,"" she said. According to Erkmen, Turkey needs to allow certain medication that leads to miscarriage at home. ""The World Health Organization recommends this medicine and it's known to be safe until the 10th week of pregnancy. Only two to three in every 100,000 women need surgical intervention after taking the pill. It's being used in France since 1992 and the death rate is zero,"" she said. ""A study in Turkey showed that 92 percent of women would prefer to use it if necessary since abortion also has psychological consequences,"" Erkmen added.

Close Homepage Categories Human rights Life style Science tech Urban beat Pages About us Privacy policy","In Turkey, while abortion is technically legal within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, it is nearly inaccessible in practice, especially in public hospitals. Academic Sedef Erkmen explains that the Turkish government, led by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has increasingly promoted anti-abortion views, leading to a de facto ban. Although abortion was legalized in 1983, recent years have seen a shift in policy; since 2012, access has been restricted as many doctors refuse to perform the procedure, even though they legally should, because they are often backed by government support. Women seeking abortions often face referral to private hospitals where procedures are costly, or they must resort to dangerous alternatives. The lack of access to affordable birth control exacerbates this issue, especially for impoverished women.

A 2016 study by Kadir Has University revealed that only 7.8% of public hospitals perform abortions upon request. Erkmen argues that the AKP’s policies emphasize traditional family roles over women’s rights, reflecting an ideology that values family structures as central to the “ideal society.” This policy results in further restrictions, such as requiring written permission from husbands for married women or fears of being documented for single women seeking medical advice on pregnancy.

Erkmen also advocates for allowing safe, medically-approved abortion pills, as used in other countries, to reduce the need for surgical intervention and decrease health risks."

Todays vote by Senate Republicans yet again proves they have no interest in protecting Americans access to health care or ensuring people with pre-existing conditions are able to keep their health care in the midst of a public health crisis, said HRC President Alphonso David. While people are suffering across the country, instead of offering aid, McConnell and Senate Republicans are rushing to confirm Amy Coney Barrett a Supreme Court nominee who could deal a fatal blow to people maintaining their basic health care--especially protections for people with preexisting conditions--LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights. The last four years have been an assault on equality, health care and the civil rights of millions across the country -- an assault led by Donald Trump, Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell. We must Unite for Equality and hold them accountable this November at the ballot box. Should the ACA be eliminated, more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions will lose their protections and guaranteed access to coverage, including those with employer-sponsored insurance who could once again face annual or lifetime limits on care. Tens of millions of people could lose coverage during a global pandemic as COVID-19 would qualify as a pre-existing condition. Last week, HRC responded to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Coney Barrett has demonstrated hostility toward LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, and her work and rulings have raised significant concerns to her approach to Civil Rights law. She has criticized the ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Actwhich has helped millions attain quality, affordable healthcareand expressed opinions that suggest she would strike down the law. Days after the election, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an argument in a case that could undermine this transformative piece of legislation, and with it the healthcare security of more than one hundred million people, including a disproportionate number of LGBTQ people. HRC published a research brief outlining the particular health and economic risks faced by the LGBTQ community during the COVID-19 public health crisis. Many in the LGBTQ community are uniquely vulnerable, as they are more likely to work jobs in highly affected industries, often with more exposure andor higher economic sensitivity to the COVID-19 crisis, are less likely to have health coverage and are more likely to smoke and have chronic illnesses like asthma.

Go","On October 1, 2020, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) condemned the Senate Republicans’ vote, led by Mitch McConnell, which aimed to weaken healthcare protections, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions. This action occurred amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when access to healthcare was critically important. HRC President Alphonso David expressed that Republicans were prioritizing the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett over addressing health care issues, despite the ongoing crisis.

The Supreme Court was set to hear a case soon that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which protects over 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. If the ACA were eliminated, many could lose access to coverage, especially those with employer-sponsored insurance or chronic conditions like asthma. Furthermore, COVID-19 itself could be classified as a pre-existing condition, exacerbating the crisis.

Barrett’s nomination raised concerns due to her history of opposition to LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights. Her stance on the ACA and civil rights law has been perceived as threatening to the health and economic security of millions, particularly LGBTQ individuals who face unique vulnerabilities during the pandemic. The HRC emphasized the need for accountability, urging citizens to vote against leaders who continue to undermine health care access and equality."
DeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony ‚Ä¢ Florida Phoenix,"DeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony Florida Phoenix HOME NEWS Education Health Politics Law Environment Culture Society Working The Economy Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 1231 News Story Culture SocietyFL Legislature 2022Politics Law DeSantis signs 15-week abortion ban into law during quasi-religious ceremony By Michael Moline - April 14, 2022 1231 pm Republican State Rep. Erin Grall, House sponsor of HB 5, the 15-week abortion ban. Gov. Ron DeSantis background signed the bill into law April 14, 2022. Credit DeSantis Facebook page. Gov. Ron DeSantis went to church Thursday to sign a 15-week abortion ban into law during a ceremony bearing many of the accoutrements of a worship service. We are there to defend those who cant defend themselves, the governor told an enthusiastic crowd at the Nacion de Fe church in Kissimmee. This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation, he said. The American Civil Liberties Union immediately promised to challenge the law in court. Make no mistake If this abortion ban goes into effect, it would have devastating consequences for pregnant people, especially those who are not able to afford to travel out of state in search of the essential health care they need, legislative director Kara Gross said in a written statement. Nobody should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. We will take swift legal action to protect Floridians rights and defend against this cruel attack on our bodily autonomy. The new law HB 5 bans abortions after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest, although they would be allowed in cases of severe fetal abnormality. Abortion rights advocates argue that it is blatantly unconstitutional under existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents including Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The 15-week ban in Florida takes effect on July 1. That gives the justices time to rule in a constitutional challenge to a similar law from Mississippi before they take their summer break around the end of June. That courts new Republican supermajority is widely expected to uphold the Mississippi statute, either by overruling those precedents or trimming them into oblivion. Florida Constitution The Florida Supreme Court is also in play here. It ruled in 1989 that an abortion-consent law for minors was unconstitutional because it violated privacy provisions in the state Constitution. The new state Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, is far more conservative than the court that upheld the right to privacy and hasnt by shy about overturning its own precedents. A large crowd attended the signing of Floridas 15-week abortion bill. The law goes into affect July 1. April 14, 2022. The bill-signing event in Central Florida included a large, enthusiastic crowd that broke into cheers and waved signs saying, Pro Life. It featured witness testimony from women whod undergone abortions and regretted it and others whod refused abortions and did not regret it. The ceremony stood in stark contrast to two years ago, when DeSantis announced that hed signed an abortion parental-consent bill via a press release that tucked it among 14 separate pieces of legislation while holding a public bill-signing ceremony for two water-quality measures. On Thursday, there was much talk of prayer, including from Erin Grall, a Republican representing Indian River and part of St. Lucie counties who sponsored the legislation in the House. She thanked people who prayed for her as the legislation advanced during the recent legislative session and those who are praying every day to end the horrific abortions that plague our country. Grall, an attorney, referred to those U.S. Supreme Court precedents during the bill-signing ceremony. The reality of the Roe decision is that men on the Supreme Court proclaimed that women, in order to achieve equality with men, must be able to kill their own children. As a woman, I refuse to accept such a perverse version of equality, Grall said. no abortions Sen. Kelli Stargel, Senate sponsor of the 15-week abortion ban. Credit Danielle J. Brown. Senate sponsor Kelli Stargel, representing portions of Lake and Polk counties, remarked that were looking at the potential of Roe v. Wade being overturned, adding, hopefully, in the future, there will be no abortions. Also on hand were Senate President Wilton Simpson and House Speaker Chris Sprowls, who called DeSantis the most pro-life governor in America. So, too, was Simone Marstiller, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, which regulates abortion clinics. Sprowls continued Like many of you, I believe that life is a gift from God. And, as I look out into this audience, I see many familiar faces who have been warriors on the front lines of the life movement, whether it is ministering to young women, whether it is helping them as they give birth to their child in pregnancy centers across this state. You have been a part of this as much as every single legislator here and for that we are very grateful. Reaction was swift. Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Nikki Fried, running in the Democratic primary to oppose DeSantis this fall, issued a written statement This law is a despicable and disgusting assault on women. Its an insult to our dignity and our ability to make these deeply personal decisions about our own lives, and it will have a devastating impact on the physical and emotional health of women across Florida, Fried said. Hypocrisy The hypocrisy of Republicans who love to brag about how free our state is while pushing a law that will literally force women and girls to give birth is absolutely outrageous. This law is a direct attack on womens constitutional rights, and its cruel, extreme, and inhumane, Fried said. On Twitter, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, also in the Democratic primary, called the law an unconstitutional attack on women that strips away their reproductive freedom. Women should make decisions about their own bodies, not governors. Id veto this bill and any attempt to restrict the right to choose. Full stop. State Sen. Annette Taddeo, another Democrat running for governor, issued her own written statement. We are less free today than before the session started, it reads. As Latin American countries like Colombia are moving forward and expanding access to health care, were moving backward in Florida. Gov. DeSantis has just signed into law an extreme bill that was made even crueler by the rejections to provide exemptions for victims of rape, human trafficking, and incest. Florida Sen. Lauren Book. WFSU photo Not moderate or fair Lauren Book of Broward County, leader of the Senate Democrats, said DeSantis had forced the women of Florida back 50 years, before Roe. This is not a moderate or fair bill if a woman or girl must live with the consequence of someone elses actions, revictimized by the decisions of Floridas right-wing GOP, she said in a written statement. Without access to safe and legal procedures, a womans life and her liberty are severely endangered. This is nothing more than an authoritarian move by Florida Republicans. Florida will never be free while lawmakers turn a blind eye to womens rights, victims rights, and to the decent and basic needs of our citizens. However, Andrew Shirvell, founder and executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn, offered praise. This truly historic law will annually save an estimated 5,000 unborn children from being murdered here in Florida via brutal late-term abortions. Florida Voice for the Unborn anticipates that any legal challenges to the legislation whether brought in federal or state court will ultimately be unsuccessful, Shirvell said in a written statement.

The law bans abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest, though exceptions are made for severe fetal abnormalities. DeSantis emphasized that this law represents significant protections for life, and the event was marked by speeches, prayers, and testimony from women who shared personal stories about abortion.

The law’s passage comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on a similar 15-week abortion law from Mississippi, which may lead to the reversal of long-standing precedents like Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Florida’s 15-week ban is set to take effect on July 1, 2022. The Florida Supreme Court, with a conservative majority appointed by DeSantis, may also play a role in the law’s future.

The law has sparked strong reactions. Abortion rights advocates, including the ACLU and Democratic politicians, criticized it as unconstitutional and harmful to women’s rights. They highlighted the lack of exemptions for rape and incest, calling it an attack on bodily autonomy. In contrast, pro-life advocates celebrated the bill, praising it as a historic move that would save thousands of unborn children.

The bill signing also featured remarks from key Republican figures, including Rep. Erin Grall and Sen. Kelli Stargel, who expressed their opposition to Roe v. Wade and endorsed the goal of eliminating abortion entirely. The law’s passage has intensified the political debate in Florida, with figures like Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist condemning it, while DeSantis supporters tout it as a victory for pro-life values."

So for years, Cheryl Bachelder kept quiet. She stood out professionally as the rare female CEO of a major corporation, overseeing Popeyes while chasing after three daughters and, eventually, four grandsons. As a Christian, she watched with distaste as her fellow business leaders indulged the decadence and money-fueled antics of the 1980s and 90s, posing on magazine covers with jets and girls. She and her husband donated to candidates for political office whom they knew and personally trusted. But because she oversaw a large, publicly traded company, Bachelder mostly kept her views on one particularly controversial issue secret. If I go to lunch with a good friend, and they find out Im pro-life, I can tell you the look on their face, she told me. Youre kidding me. You are an educated, CEO woman and youre pro-life. Whats wrong with you?Recently, Bachelder has become captivated by what will happen if the anti-abortion-rights movement succeeds in its goal to make abortion illegal in the United States. What if there were a lot more God-given babies, and we were, as a community, completely unprepared to help their mothers? she said. Now that shes retired, Bachelder is willing to speak publicly about her views on abortionour conversation was the first time she had spoken with a journalist for a national news outlet about her involvement in the anti-abortion-rights movement.Activists in that movement are working towards a grand, and perhaps fantastical, vision a world where abortion is not just illegal, but unthinkable, and where babies are much more common as a result. This future has felt more tangible since the election of Donald Trump, who appointed two justices to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who are skeptical of the constitutional right to abortion laid out in Roe v. Wade. With Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the staunchest defenders of abortion on the Court, recently hospitalized and going through a new round of chemotherapy, its possible that abortion rights will face an existential challenge within the next few years. Anti-abortion-rights activists realize that this moment of triumph will require planningand infrastructure. The magnitude of that question is huge, Bachelder said. I think its fair to say every community is unprepared to answer that question todayprobably hasnt even thought about it.She has long believed that life begins at conception and that death is God-ordained and should not be invited early with assisted suicide or other kinds of interventions. She and her husband have donated to faith-based organizations that provide pregnancy support and attempt to direct people away from abortion. But she nevertheless worries about getting into the mud-throwing conversations of politics, she said. We actually work on solving things, in the business world. We dont have any time to yell and scream and throw things. She longs, in other words, for association with an anti-abortion-rights movement that is apolitical, even though abortion is one of the most politically charged topics of our time.Read The progressive roots of the pro-life movementLate last year, Bachelder attended a fundraiser hosted by the Susan B. Anthony List, or SBA List, the anti-abortion-rights organization that has arguably had the most influence over Trumps judicial appointments and voter outreach on this issue, at a home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a tony city north of Atlanta. She and a group of friends, mostly other business leaders, were there to brainstorm all the community support systems that would need to be stronger in a world where abortion is illegal mental-health services, addiction-recovery programs, affordable child care. Many of their proposed solutions didnt touch the messy business of politics. One woman even suggested that they consider taking pregnant women into their homes. Wow, Bachelder said to herself, I havent thought about that. Along with other members of this group, Bachelder agreed to financially back an SBA List test program in Georgia called PLANthe Pregnancy and Life Assistance Networkthat would compile and publicize resources already available to women dealing with unplanned pregnancies, modeled after a version of the program in Northern Virginia. In theory, its an ambitious effort to find common ground between hard-core anti-abortion-rights activists and people who want to help pregnant women but may not be convinced that abortion should be completely banned.Marjorie Dannenfelser, the head of the SBA List, brought White House-branded Twizzlers and a commemorative plate along to the gatheringspoils of her success in Washington. We believe we are coming much closer to a different kind of world, where Roe v. Wade is either unrecognizable because its been chipped away or its overturned and laws start to flourish in states that reflect the will of the people who live there, she told me. Over the past year, the SBA Lists research organization, the Charlotte Lozier Institute, has undertaken a massive effort to look at the state resources available to pregnant women and children, including housing, medical centers, income limits for Medicaid, and more. This served as a foundation for PLAN, which is still in its early stages. The projectimagining the beatific vision of a post-Roe world, as Dannenfelser put itis partly pitched at people like Bachelder who oppose abortion but shy away from partisan battles. A lot of donors, a lot of people in the evangelical community, a lot of breathing human beings just hate politics right now, Dannenfelser said. She spends her days in the roughest area of politics, she added, fighting over a controversial issue in tightly contested elections. My dream, and my belief, is that at the heart of the pro-life movement, there is not that dissonance of political opposition.There is an inherent tension in an anti-abortion-rights project designed to rally social services for women, no matter how ostensibly apolitical it may be. Over the past two decades, the anti-abortion-rights movement has aligned itself almost exclusively with the GOP, which generally favors cutting government funding for housing, food stamps, and other programs that support poor women and children. No group has solidified this partisan alignment more than the SBA List, which pours money and manpower into supporting Republicans in competitive races. As Democrats more aggressively pursue the expansion of abortion rights, the SBA List sees the Republican Party as its only viable ally, at least at the national level.Bachelder envisions a future stage of the PLAN project in which policy makers would do a version of the gap-planning analysis that businesses use to anticipate what customersin this case, pregnant womenmight need. But getting there, to a place where most anti-abortion-rights legislators would also champion the expansion of social services, would require a massive political realignment. Although a post-Roe world has seemed more possible than ever lately, its also a ways off.Read When conservative justices revoltThis summer, the anti-abortion-rights movement suffered a major defeat at the Supreme Court, when Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal wing in June Medical Services v. Russo to strike down a Louisiana law that would have restricted abortion access. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence lashed out at Roberts in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, calling him a disappointment to conservatives.Some anti-abortion-rights activists may dream of building a postabortion future. But for the present, the political fight is all-consuming. One thing is clear, Pence tweeted in June We need more Conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. FourMoreYears.Emma Green is a staff writer at The New Yorker. Previously, she was a staff writer at The Atlantic, covering politics, policy, and religion.","The article from The Atlantic discusses how the anti-abortion-rights movement in the U.S. is preparing for a potential post-Roe v. Wade scenario, focusing on strategies to support pregnant women and children in a society where abortion is illegal. The movement, which envisions a world where abortion is not only illegal but “unthinkable,” has gained momentum with recent conservative appointments to the Supreme Court, creating the potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned or diminished.

One central figure is Cheryl Bachelder, former CEO of Popeyes and a pro-life advocate, who represents a segment of anti-abortion supporters interested in building supportive infrastructure rather than engaging in political battles. Along with other business leaders, Bachelder supports initiatives like the Pregnancy and Life Assistance Network (PLAN), a program piloted by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) to provide resources to women facing unplanned pregnancies. This program seeks to compile and make accessible services such as mental health care, addiction recovery, and affordable childcare. The SBA List, led by Marjorie Dannenfelser, has been influential in promoting anti-abortion judges and in mobilizing support within the GOP. While Dannenfelser envisions a future where anti-abortion advocacy is less partisan, the movement’s close alliance with the Republican Party remains strong, primarily due to the party’s stance on limiting abortion access.

However, the movement faces challenges in aligning its goals with social services traditionally supported by Democrats, as many anti-abortion-rights legislators oppose government spending on welfare programs that would assist low-income mothers and children. This tension complicates the plan for a post-Roe world, as the desired increase in social support for mothers may require shifts in political priorities.

Despite recent setbacks, such as the Supreme Court’s decision in June Medical Services v. Russo, which struck down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, the movement remains steadfast. Figures like Vice President Mike Pence have continued to advocate for conservative justices to further their cause. The article suggests that while some activists focus on creating a supportive, apolitical future, the movement’s current reality is deeply enmeshed in political strife and the pursuit of legal victories."

Home Health topics Our work News Emergencies About us Detail 7 December 2020 Feature story Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh Many adolescents make the transition to adulthood in good health, yet others might face injuries resulting from an accident or violence experience mental health or substance abuse conditions go through early childbearing which includes increased risks for newborns and young mothers or fall ill with endemic diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria.Addressing adolescents health needs, particularly among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, is key to promoting a healthy development among adolescents and youths. In recent years, the World Health Organization WHO has strived to expand options for young people whilst prioritizing adolescent rights in health emergencies.In Coxs Bazar, home to nearly 325 000 Rohingya adolescents, a range of individuals and institutions play an important role in promoting adolescents health and well-being. WHO is coordinating with the Government of Bangladesh GoB, a Sexual Reproductive Health working group and an Adolescent Task Force to support partners providing adolescent-friendly services in their health facilties. The impact goes far beyond sexual and reproductive health and rights outcomes. WHO is striving to expand health options for the nearly 325 000 Rohingya adolescents in Coxs Bazar by offering capacity building to partners providing adolescent-friendly services. WHO BangladeshTatiana Almeida A few days ago a 17-year-old Rohingya girl came to see me. She sounded very determined in learning about contraception options and I gave her all the information pointing out that it was her body and as such her choice whether to use contraceptives which will help prevent sexually transmitted diseases and delay pregnancy, says Umme Hani, a Midwife working at Partners in Health and Development PHD primary health center at Camp 10, in Ukhiya.I could see, however, that she wasnt doing well and started making friendly questions just as I learned at the WHO training. When she finally opened up, she told me in tears that her family had arranged her marriage. As a smart young woman, she had decided to delay pregnancy until she was sure that her husband would be a good father. I ensured her that she could visit me anytime she needed a friend, concludes Umme Hani.At the heart of any health care system, health care workers such as Midwife Umme Hani are pivotal to address the specific needs of adolescents throught equitable, appropriate, effective and accessible health care services. In the Rohingya Refugee camps in Coxs Bazar, when adolescents from Camp 10 have health-related concerns they can talk to Umme Hani, a Midwife trained by WHO to provide adolescent-friendly services. WHO BangladeshTatiana Almeida The Partners in Health and Development PHD primary health center facility at Camp 10, in Ukhiya, reaches a population of over 16 000 Rohingya refugees seeing between 100 to 250 patients a day. Among these, 15 to 20 are adolescents. WHO BangladeshTatiana Almeida To date, the Training on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights ASRHR has reached 50 health care workers to strenghthen adolescent-friendly services at 50 health care facilities in Coxs Bazar. More batches are planned to reach a total of 120 health care professionals from different partner organizations. WHO National Consultant on Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, Adolescent Health, Dr Tasnova Sadneen, is facilitating the training together with ASRHR Master Trainers from UNFPA, IOM, IRC, SCI and PHD.Frontline health care workers with adequate training and knowledge can play an important role in promoting the health and health seeking behaviours among adolescents. We cant deny that Rohingya adolescents and youths - a significant portion of the refugee population in Coxs Bazar - need skilled health workforce to respond to their health needs. One of the components of this training is to guide health care workers on how to build a relationship of trust, understanding and compassion with adolescent patients, explains Dr Tasnova Sadneen.Coxs Bazar Civil Surgeon, Dr Mahbubur Rahman, WHO Head of Sub-Office, Dr Kai von Harbou, and Dr Tasnova Sadneen at the Training on Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights ASRHR held in Coxs Bazar in November 2020. ISCGSyed TafhimEffective interventions for improving adolescent health and development are vital in Coxs Bazar and I am very happy to see many health care workers here today willing to learn more about adolescent-friendly health approaches. I believe that after your participation in the ASRH training you will feel more confident in providing health care services to adolescents and I wish you much success while doing so, says Coxs Bazar Civil Surgeon, Dr Mahbubur Rahman, at the opening ceremony.Services geared for adolescents go far beyond sexual and reproductive health as they address the full range of adolescents health and development needs. With that in mind, and with the guidance of the Civil Surgeon, we are creating training opportunities to expand the knowledge on adolescent health and development and their implications in clinical practice. I believe this is going to advance and strenghten universal health coverage for both Rohingya refugees and host communities in Coxs Bazar, explains WHO Head of Sub-Office, Dr Kai von Harbou. Making health services adolescent friendly sets out the public health rationale for making it easier for adolescents to obtain the health services that they need to protect and improve their health and wellbeing, including sexual and reproductive health services.WHO and partners are ensuring the continued prioritization of sexual and reproductive health and rights throughout COVID-19 response in humanitarian settings, and to bring a gender lens to the response. Sexual and reproductive health comes of age in Coxs Bazar 5 December 2018 Fact sheets Adolescent and young adult health 28 April 2023 Adolescent pregnancy 2 June 2023 Quick links Media centre Head of WHO Office Procurement Careers Regional links Data Publications Help Contact us Integrity Hotline Privacy Legal Notice 2024 WHO","The World Health Organization (WHO) is addressing the health needs of nearly 325,000 Rohingya adolescents in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, by expanding adolescent-friendly healthcare services that go beyond traditional sexual and reproductive health (SRH). This initiative involves training local health workers to better serve adolescents, particularly those at risk of early marriage, mental health issues, substance abuse, and endemic diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.

In collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh and various partners, WHO’s approach prioritizes equitable, effective, and accessible healthcare for Rohingya youths. By training healthcare providers, such as midwives and clinic staff, WHO is strengthening their ability to engage adolescents with trust, empathy, and culturally sensitive care. This training includes guidance on SRH, equipping healthcare workers to discuss contraception, family planning, and personal autonomy with young patients—critical for adolescents navigating family pressures or arranged marriages.

One example is Umme Hani, a midwife trained by WHO, who offers compassionate counseling at a camp health facility, serving as a trusted resource for young people facing complex personal and health challenges. WHO’s training sessions have thus far reached 50 healthcare professionals across 50 facilities in Cox’s Bazar, with plans to expand to 120 providers. These trained professionals are instrumental in fostering health-seeking behaviors among adolescents and are expected to contribute to universal health coverage for both refugee and host communities.

Dr. Tasnova Sadneen and Dr. Kai von Harbou emphasize that the initiative’s goal is to ensure the holistic health and development of adolescents while maintaining a strong focus on SRH and gender-sensitive approaches, particularly vital amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This strategic commitment is intended to improve the overall well-being of Rohingya adolescents, providing a foundation for healthier adulthood and advancing public health objectives in this vulnerable population."
"Legislature: Senate Committee Advances Bill To Repeal Abortion Law, Republican Senators Respond ‚Äì Los Alamos Reporter","Legislature Senate Committee Advances Bill To Repeal Abortion Law, Republican Senators Respond Los Alamos Reporter Los Alamos Reporter The News from Los Alamos Beyond Menu Skip to content Home About Contact January 26, 2021 Los Alamos Reporter Legislature Senate Committee Advances Bill To Repeal Abortion Law, Republican Senators Respond SENATE REPUBLICANS NEWS After a two-hour long delay and a hearing marred by technical difficulties and limited public participation, the virtual Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee voted Monday along party lines to repeal New Mexicos abortion law. Senate Bill 10, sponsored by Democratic Senator Linda Lopez District 11-Bernalillo and others, would strike an entire section of law that among other things protects medical professionals from being forced to participate in abortions and requires that abortions be performed by licensed physicians. Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals, said Senator Gregg Schmedes District 19-Bernalillo, Sandoval, Santa Fe, and Torrance. As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans. The current law includes protections from recriminatory action when a hospital or their staff decline to perform abortions based on moral or religious grounds. In 1973, the New Mexico Court of Appeals declared this section of the law to be constitutional and a 1990 New Mexico Attorney General Opinion further reiterated its constitutionality. A total repeal of New Mexicos abortion law is not the solution, added Senator Crystal Diamond District 35-Dona Ana, Hidalgo, Luna, and Sierra. In addition to keeping the conscience clause intact, we should be working to strengthen, not weaken standards of care for women. The thought that a non-physician would be allowed to perform a dangerous, late-term abortion on a minor child without any parental knowledge is unconscionable. That is the type of scenario we are exposing women to if this bill passes. Senate Bill 10 advanced from the Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on a 5-3 vote with all three Republican Senators, Gregg Schmedes, David Gallegos, and Stuart Ingle, voting in opposition.

Email Required Name Required Website d","The New Mexico Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee recently advanced Senate Bill 10, which proposes to repeal the state’s existing abortion law. Sponsored by Democratic Senator Linda Lopez, the bill aims to remove protections that currently exempt medical professionals from being compelled to perform abortions based on moral or religious grounds and mandates that only licensed physicians perform these procedures. The current law, which was deemed constitutional by both the New Mexico Court of Appeals in 1973 and a 1990 Attorney General opinion, also protects hospitals and staff from punitive action if they refuse to participate in abortion services due to conscientious objections.

Republican senators voiced strong opposition to the bill. Senator Gregg Schmedes, a medical doctor, warned that the loss of these protections might prompt some healthcare professionals to leave the state, potentially limiting healthcare access in New Mexico. Senator Crystal Diamond expressed concerns about safety and standards of care, arguing that the bill could lead to situations where non-physicians are allowed to perform high-risk abortions, including on minors without parental knowledge.

The committee’s vote fell along party lines, with a 5-3 split in favor of advancing the bill, supported by Democrats and opposed by Republicans. The bill is set to proceed to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further consideration."

Tweet Share Comment Popular in Even the Supreme Courts Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To So Trumps Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh? John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges Once again, womens reproductive freedom is more concerned with doctors than women. Following the briefing and oral arguments in June Medical, the Louisiana case that calls into question the continued force of Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Whole Womans Health, its now quite clear that the primary questions opponents of reproductive freedom are asking have nothing to do with maternal autonomy or decision-making, and everything to do with abortion providers and whether they are bad people and unfit doctors. Louisianas transparently unconstitutional lawthe same law that was struck down from Texas in 2016 at the high courtmandates that abortion providers must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they practice. The briefs supporting the law openly advance arguments that recklessly pit women against their own abortion providers. After years of merely implying that such providers are cash-starved grifters who prey on foolish women in rat-infested death labs, the critique now forms part of the spine of the states case, the Department of Justices defense, and Samuel Alitos line of questioning at arguments. Given that in 1973, Roe v. Wade famously located the right to abortion in the bilateral relationship between women and their physicians Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained in her Supreme Court confirmation hearing that the Roe decision is a highly medically oriented decision because it features, along with the woman, the right of the doctor to exercise his profession, the attempt to fracture that relationship is hardly a surprise. Justice Harry Blackmun, who authored the 72 majority opinion, mentioned the word physician 48 times and woman only 44 times in the decision. Since Roe, then, it has been at least tacitly understood that the interests of pregnant women and their physicians were aligned in reproductive freedom cases. That is the reason abortion providers and clinics were granted decadeslong standing to bring legal challenges on behalf of their patients, who would by necessity be too poor, too distracted, or too pregnant to file suit in what would likely be grueling yearslong litigation. After all, it is difficult, if you are seeking to terminate a pregnancy, to remain pregnant for the three years it takes a case to wend its way through the legal system. But in his dissent in Whole Womans Health, Justice Clarence Thomas proposed a radical new notion Clinics and abortion doctors should be denied standing to sue on behalf of the pregnant women they treat because these doctors were fundamentally horriblecorrupt and exploitative and seeking only to profit off the trusting women they purported to serve. As such, they have a vested interest in fighting sensible regulations that protect women, and their interests are inherently at odds with those of their patients. Now, four years later, as the state of Louisiana brings the same basic complaint that Whole Womans Health resolved, the state is taking its cue from Thomas. In its brief in June Medical, Louisiana put it this way Abortion providers and their patients have an obvious conflict in the inevitable tradeoff between cost and safety. Women have an interest in ensuring their own health and safety when they choose to obtain an abortion. But plaintiffs interest is to reduce compliance costs and government oversight while providing as many abortions as possible. And Justice Samuel Alito put it this way at Wednesdays oral argument, questioning the lawyer representing the clinics Would you agree with the general proposition that a party should not be able to sue ostensibly to protect the right of other people, if there is a real conflict of interest between the party who is suing and those whose rights the party claims to be attempting to defend? When the lawyer replied that there was no such conflict, he said he found that answer amazing. Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, the Trump administrations attorney, further insisted that the interests of abortion physicians and patients are not necessarily aligned. One is the interest of for-profit providers and not being regulated in particular ways. The other is the interest of women in their own health and safety. It sounds like a claim about female autonomy, but in fact its a claim rooted in doubts about female autonomy. To buy into this reasoning is to further take for granted that abortion providers are different from plastic surgeons, dental surgeons, and every other health care provider in ways that require extra regulation, even when those regulations are medically unnecessary, geographically irrational, and potentially catastrophically dangerous to women. Further, as was the case in Roe v. Wade, the pregnant woman has become, again, at most the best supporting actress in a medical drama between mostly male legislators, mostly male jurists, and their mostly male ideas about physicians and suggestible women. We may have thought wed come a long way from Blackmuns physician-centered analysis in Roe, to the at least nominally woman-centered language of Casey and the emphatically woman-centered rhetoric of Whole Womans Health, but it seems we have merely arrived back at the same place we started A fight about whether abortion doctors do or do not have their patients best interests at heart. It is fitting that in a week in which women have become invisible in so many other contexts in the public sphere, theyve also been all but erased, once again, from their own reproductive rights. There has always been a paradox that lies in centering abortion rights in the providerone that we tend to elide in modern debates about doctrine. At one point, in the early abortion battles, doctors and pregnant women really were at odds In her essential new book, Policing the Womb, professor Michele Goodwin of the University of California, Irvine, recounts the early history of American gynecology, including Marion Sims, the grandfather of gynecology who conducted his experiments on the female slaves he rented. Early gynecology organized itself around white male doctors who demonized and displaced female midwives. As Goodwin notes, the legal history of abortion and its regulation root in the quagmire created out of the racialization and sex-exclusivity of reproductive medicine in the United States. That these were the men to whom Blackmun, who had served as counsel for the Mayo Clinic, was so deferential in Roe went unnoticed at the time by most court watchers, although the young litigator, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, even then regretted that the case was always framed from the physicians standpoint, and not the womans. The physicians who seek admitting privileges in the Louisiana lawsuit are a far cry from the turf-grabbing doctors of the early gynecology profession, and even from the avuncular physicians of Blackmuns 1970s Roe opinion. These providers, often imperiling their own lives and the lives of their families, are so phenomenally proficient that they have a hospitalization rate that stands, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted in Whole Womans Health, at less than one-quarter of 1 percent in the first trimester, and less than one-half of 1 percent in the second trimester. This very proficiency is part of the reason they cannot obtain admitting privileges and the record shows that they did in fact try and were refused. Hospitals dont want to give such privileges to physicians who almost never need admit a patient. As Breyer noted in Whole Womans Health, doctors at the El Paso clinic in Texas performed 17,000 procedures in the preceding 10 years and not one had to be transferred to a hospital. That made admitting privileges impossible to obtain. There is no medical need for extra credentialing, and requiring the privileges serves only to cast abortion providers as dubious stewards of their patients health. At this moment when government is working double time to cast physicians and science as less than reliable, that is a particularly nasty smear. The irony, then, is that despite the wobbly doctor-based reasoning of Roe, the physicians in contemporary cases are so profoundly aligned with the interests of their patients that they take on landmark lawsuits, subject themselves to years of depositions and expense, in order to serve patients who desperately need them to protect their interests in court. They are not the all-knowing wise decision-makers of Roe, nor are they the chop-shop villians Alito imagines. They arenow more than everequal partners in a reproductive rights ground war from which women as actual combatants with agency and moral sophistication are being systematically erased. Focusing on false, unfounded stereotypes about wicked abortion providers in June Medical is especially problematic given that its clear that those who seek to shutter clinics in this fashion are also oddly willing to jail women who seek abortions in Ohio and Georgia. Texas held hearings last year about imposing capital punishment for women who terminate their pregnancies. So, which is it? Are women culpable moral agents who should be punished for their choices, or are they the unwitting dupes of unscrupulous abortion doctors? And how is it possible that in Texas and Louisiana, it now appears that they can somehow be both? Are women evil or just stupid when they seek to end a pregnancy? Is her doctor a partner or a grifter? Or have we finally reached the stage in the law of reproductive justice at which we will accept that a woman is so perfectly invisible that whether she makes her own choices or her doctor makes them for her doesnt even matter anymore?

In the Louisiana case June Medical Services v. Russo, the focus is on challenging the qualifications and trustworthiness of abortion providers, positioning them as adversaries to women’s health. Louisiana’s law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges was previously deemed unconstitutional but is now being revisited, with opponents framing abortion providers as profit-driven and potentially unsafe.

Lithwick highlights that the tactic of questioning doctors’ motives mirrors aspects of the Roe v. Wade decision, which placed significant emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship, often prioritizing the role of physicians in reproductive decisions over the autonomy of women. The Louisiana law supporters argue that there is an inherent conflict of interest between abortion providers, who seek to reduce regulation, and patients, who need protection. Justices such as Samuel Alito and figures from the Trump administration echoed this view, suggesting abortion doctors might not act in their patients’ best interests.

Lithwick also delves into historical tensions in reproductive healthcare, where male-dominated gynecology once marginalized midwives and restricted women’s roles in reproductive decisions. She argues that framing abortion debates around the ethics and qualifications of doctors ignores the agency and autonomy of women. Furthermore, the regulations imposed on providers, though medically unnecessary, serve to portray them as disreputable, a narrative reinforced by conservative justices and advocates. These stereotypes support broader efforts to criminalize abortion, evidenced by recent proposals in states like Ohio, Georgia, and Texas that even consider punishing women directly for seeking abortions.

Lithwick concludes by critiquing the ongoing erasure of women from the center of reproductive rights discussions. She questions whether the law will continue to disregard women’s autonomy, reducing them to passive figures in a battle that frames them as either “misled” or “culpable.” Ultimately, the article argues that the anti-abortion strategy is a troubling reversal, focusing on discrediting providers as a means of limiting access, while sidelining women’s rights altogether."
"Over 80% of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll | Notes From Poland","Over 80 of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll Notes From Poland News Insights Po polsku Topics Politics Society Culture Business History Education Energy Climate Law Media Podcasts Notes from Poland Podcast The VoiCEE podcast About us Our story Editorial team Advisory Board Notes from Poland Foundation Contact Newsletters Notes from Poland Newsletter Central and Eastern Europe Newsletter Select Page Over 80 of Polish women aged under 40 oppose new abortion restrictions, finds poll Feb 18, 2021 Society Among women in Poland aged 18 to 40, only 2 say they support the recent near-total ban on abortion, while 7 want a complete ban, according to a new poll. By contrast, the largest proportion 44 want abortion to be available on demand. Meanwhile, after much pressure to take a stance on this issue, Polands main opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform PO, has today issued a new position on abortion. It favours not just returning to the previous status quo, but liberalising access to terminations. From a Polityka survey of Polish women of reproductive age. 44 think abortion should be permitted on demand up to 12th week.38 support the status quo prior to the ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal.2 agree with the ruling.7 think abortion should be banned outright. pic.twitter.comq9yyrjg06G Ben Stanley BDStanley February 17, 2021 In the new Kantar poll for Polityka the first to look specifically at the women most directly affected by the abortion law a plurality of 44 expressed the view that abortion should be available on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy. A further 38 said that they support the status quo prior to the recent change, when pregnancies could be terminated in three cases if they threatened the mothers life or health, if they resulted from rape or incest, or if the foetus suffered from severe defects. Only 2 said that they support the current situation, introduced by a Constitutional Tribunal ruling that banned the last of those three options which made up almost all legal terminations in Poland. A further 7 want a complete ban on abortion and 9 did not express a position. While 90 of respondents said that women carrying foetuses with fatal defects should be allowed an abortion, 67 agreed that the procedure should also be allowed if the foetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome as it was before the recent ruling. Over a quarter 27 said it should not be permitted for cases of Down syndrome. Majority of Poles support abortion protests and popularity of ruling party has dropped, polls show Polling has consistently shown that, among the Polish population as a whole, a large majority oppose the anti-abortion ruling and support the mass protests that have emerged in opposition to it. However, most favour a return to the previous status quo rather than a liberalisation of access to abortion. The new Kantar poll of women finds that the youngest respondents aged 18 to 24 were the most strongly in favour liberalisation, with 57 supporting abortion on demand and 29 favouring a return to the previous status quo. Likewise, 60 women in urban areas want abortion to be available on demand while 35 support a return to the status quo. In more rural areas, which are generally more conservative, the figures are 37 and 39 respectively. Participants in the abortion protests have been disproportionately urban and young. A recent study by CBOS a state-linked research agency found that young Poles are now more likely to hold left-wing views than centrist or right-wing ones for the first time in Polands post-communist history. Left-wing views highest ever recorded among young Poles, above right-wing and centrist for first time Meanwhile, in the new Kantar poll, only 7 of the women surveyed said they believed that the Constitutional Tribunals ruling was a decision it made independently. Exactly a quarter said it was due to pressure from the Catholic church, while 29 saw it as a result of an internal power struggle in the ruling camp. Almost half 45 said that the abortion issue would influence their decisions in future elections. Notably, among young women who identified themselves as supporters of the national-conservative Law and Justice PiS party, almost half support either a return to the previous status quo 27 or abortion on demand 20. PiS has supported the tightening of the abortion law. Its leader, Jarosaw Kaczyski, said that his party will strive to ensure that even very difficult pregnancies, when the child is condemned to death, is severely deformed, will end in birth, so that the child can be christened, buried, given a name. Abortion protests aim to destroy Poland and end the history of the Polish nation, says Kaczyski Among young women who support the centrist Civic Coalition which is led by PO, Kantar found that almost two thirds 64 favour abortion being available on demand. PO, which encompasses both socially liberal and more conservative wings, has been under pressure to take a clearer stance on abortion since the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was issued last October. The party had previously been in favour of the pre-ruling status quo. However, its leader, Borys Budka, recently said there can now be no return to that so-called compromise. POs deputy leader, Rafa Trzaskowski, likewise said that the pseudo-compromise has been buried by PiS. At a press conference today, the party set out its new position. We want the three conditions for abortion that were in force under the previous law to continue to apply, but we will also give the possibility of terminating pregnancy up to the 12th week in exceptional circumstances, said Magorzata Kidawa-Boska, who has been leading POs committee working on a new position. Kobiety musz mie prawo do podejmowania osobistej decyzji dotyczcej macierzystwa w zgodzie z wasnym sumieniem. Musz mie zapewnion kompleksow opiek. Przedstawilimy dzi Pakiet Praw Kobiet, bo chcemy, by kobiety byy bezpieczne i miay zagwarantowane prawo wyboru. M. Kidawa-Boska MKBlonska February 18, 2021 The party says it wants abortions to be available up to the 12th week for women who have an extremely difficult personal situation and after consultation with a psychologist and a doctor, reports Onet. In its package, PO also called for the state to guarantee sex education, free access to contraception and IVF, and prescription-free morning-after pills. PiS has opposed sex education, cut state funding for IVF, and made emergency contraceptives available only on prescription. We reject the radicalisms of the left and the right, tweeted the head of POs parliamentary caucus. We need a new social contract. However, media reports based on inside sources have suggested that there may be a rebellion from POs more conservative ranks over the new position of the leadership. Some are considering leaving the party completely, reports Wirtualna Polska. Odrzucamy radykalizmy z prawej i lewej strony. Potrzebujemy Nowej Umowy Spoecznej.

Pin It on Pinterest Support us!","A recent poll reveals strong opposition among Polish women under 40 to the country’s near-total abortion ban. Conducted by Kantar for Polityka, the survey highlights that only 2% support the recent restrictive law, while 44% favor allowing abortion on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy, and 38% prefer the conditions allowed under the previous law. The previous regulations permitted abortions in cases where the pregnancy threatened the mother’s health or life, resulted from rape or incest, or involved severe fetal defects. The Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling eliminated the latter option, which accounted for nearly all legal abortions.

Public sentiment aligns closely with these findings, showing that 90% of respondents believe abortion should be permitted for fetuses with fatal defects, and 67% support it if the fetus has Down syndrome, though 27% oppose this. Protests against the ruling have been widespread, primarily in urban areas where 60% support abortion on demand. Younger respondents (18-24) are especially pro-choice, with 57% favoring abortion on demand, reflecting a broader shift among young Poles toward left-wing views.

The centrist Civic Platform (PO) recently revised its stance to advocate for returning to the previous legal framework with some liberalization, proposing to allow abortions up to the 12th week in “exceptional” cases and offering comprehensive reproductive health support, including sex education, free contraception, and IVF. However, this shift faces resistance from conservative members within PO."

And according to statistics analyzed by The Associated Press, if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to further restrict or even ban abortions, minority women will bear the brunt of it.

Solis By Emily Wagster Pettus and Leah Willingham Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print JACKSON, Miss. AP If you are Black or Hispanic in a conservative state that already limits access to abortions, you are far more likely than a white woman to have one.And if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to further restrict or even ban abortions, minority women will bear the brunt of it, according to statistics analyzed by The Associated Press.The numbers are unambiguous. In Mississippi, people of color comprise 44 of the population but 80 of women receiving abortions, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health statistics. In Texas, theyre 59 of the population and 74 of those receiving abortions. The numbers in Alabama are 35 and 70. In Louisiana, minorities represent 42 of the population, according to the state Health Department, and about 72 of those receiving abortions.Abortion restrictions are racist, said Cathy Torres, a 25-year-old organizing manager with Frontera Fund, a Texas organization that helps women pay for abortions. They directly impact people of color, Black, brown, Indigenous people . people who are trying to make ends meet. Why the great disparities? Laurie Bertram Roberts, executive director of the Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, which provides financial support for women seeking abortion, said women of color in states with restrictive abortion laws often have limited access to health care and a lack of choices for effective birth control. Schools often have ineffective or inadequate sex education. If abortions are outlawed, those same women often poor will likely have the hardest time traveling to distant parts of the country to terminate pregnancies or raising children they might struggle to afford, said Roberts, who is Black and once volunteered at Mississippis only abortion clinic. Were talking about folks who are already marginalized, Roberts said. Amanda Furdge, who is Black, was one of those women. She was a single, unemployed college student already raising one baby in 2014 when she found out she was pregnant with another. She said she didnt know how she could afford another child.Shed had two abortions in Chicago. Getting access to an abortion provider there was no problem, Furdge said. But now she was in Mississippi, having moved home to escape an abusive relationship. Misled by advertising, she first went to a crisis pregnancy center which tried to talk her out of an abortion. By the time she found the abortion clinic, she was too far along to have the procedure.Why cant you safely, easily access abortion here? asked Furdge, 34, who is happily raising her now 7-year-old son but continues to advocate for women having the right to choose.Torres said historically, anti-abortion laws have been crafted in ways that hurt low-income women. She pointed to the Hyde Amendment, a 1980 law that prevents the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except in rare cases.She also cited the 2021 Texas law that bans abortion after around six weeks of pregnancy. Where she lives, near the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley, women are forced to travel to obtain abortions and must pass in-state border patrol checkpoints where they have to disclose their citizenship status, she said. Regardless of what legislators say, Torres insisted, the intent is to target women of color, to control their bodies They know who these restrictions are going to affect. They know that, but they dont care. But Andy Gipson, a former member of the Mississippi Legislature who is now the states agriculture and commerce commissioner, said race had nothing to do with passage of Mississippis law against abortion after the 15th week. That law is now before the Supreme Court in a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the courts 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.Gipson, a Baptist minister who is white, said he believes all people are created in the image of God and have an innate value that starts at conception. Mississippi legislators were trying to protect women and babies by putting limits on abortion, he said. I absolutely disagree with the concept that its racist or about anything other than saving babies lives, said Gipson, a Republican. Its about saving lives of the unborn and the lives and health of the mother, regardless of what color they are.To those who say that forcing women to have babies will subject them to hardships, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a white Republican, said it is easier for working mothers to balance professional success and family life than it was 49 years ago when Roe was decided.Fitch, who is divorced, often points to her own experience of working outside the home while raising three children. But Fitch grew up in an affluent family and has worked in the legal profession both factors that can give working women the means and the flexibility to get help raising children. Thats not the case for many minority women in Mississippi or elsewhere. Advocates say in many places where abortion services are being curtailed, theres little support for women who carry a baby to term.Mississippi is one of the poorest states, and people in low-wage jobs often dont receive health insurance. Women can enroll in Medicaid during pregnancy, but that coverage disappears soon after they give birth. Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black infants were about twice as likely as white infants to die during the first year of life in Mississippi, according to the March of Dimes. Across the country, U.S. Census Bureau information analyzed by The Associated Press shows fewer Black and Hispanic women have health insurance, especially in states with tight abortion restrictions. For example, in Texas, Mississippi and Georgia, at least 16 of Black women and 36 of Latinas were uninsured in 2019, some of the highest such rates in the country.Problems are compounded in states without effective education programs about reproduction. Mississippi law says sex education in public schools must emphasize abstinence to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Discussion of abortion is forbidden, and instructors may not demonstrate how to use condoms or other contraception.The Mississippi director for Planned Parenthood Southeast, Tyler Harden, is a 26-year-old Black woman who had an abortion five years ago, an experience that drove her to a career supporting pregnant women and preserving abortion rights. She said when she was attending public school in rural Mississippi, she didnt learn about birth control. Instead, a teacher stuck clear tape on students arms. The girls were told to put it on another classmates arm, and another, and watch how it lost the ability to form a bond.Theyd tell you, If you have sex, this is who you are now Youre just like this piece of tape all used up and washed up and nobody would want it, Harden said.When she became pregnant at 21, she knew she wanted an abortion. Her mother was battling cancer and Harden was in her last semester of college without a job or a place to live after graduation. She said she was made to feel fear and shame, just as she had during sex ed classes. When she went to the clinic, she said protesters told her she was killing the most precious gift from God and that she was killing a Black baby, playing into what white supremacists want. Hardens experience is not uncommon. The anti-abortion movement has often portrayed the abortion fight in racial terms. Outside the only abortion clinic operating in Mississippi, protesters hand out brochures that refer to abortion as Black genocide and say the late Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood and a proponent of eugenics, desired to eradicate minorities. The brochures compare Sanger to Adolf Hitler and proclaim Black lives did not matter to Margaret Sanger! The Mississippi clinic is not affiliated with Planned Parenthood, and Planned Parenthood itself denounces Sangers belief in eugenics. White people are not alone in making this argument. Alveda King, an evangelist who is a niece of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., is among the Black opponents of abortion who, for years, have been portraying abortion as a way to wipe out people of their race.Tanya Britton, a former president of Pro-Life Mississippi, often drives three hours from her home in the northern part of the state to pray outside the abortion clinic in Jackson. Britton is Black, and she said its a tragedy that the number of Black babies aborted since Roe would equal the population of several large cities. She also said people are too casual about terminating pregnancies.You just cant take the life of someone because this is not convenient I want to finish my education, Britton said. You wouldnt kill your 2-year-old because you were in graduate school.But state Rep. Zakiya Summers of Jackson, who is Black and a mother, suggested theres nothing casual about what poor women are doing. Receiving little support in Mississippi for example, the Legislature killed a proposal to expand postpartum Medicaid coverage in 2021 -- they are sometimes forced to make hard decisions. Women are just out here trying to survive, you know? she said. And Mississippi doesnt make it any easier.Associated Press reporters Noreen Nasir in Jackson, Mississippi, and Jasen Lo in Chicago contributed to this report.","The article highlights the disproportionate impact of abortion restrictions on minority women, particularly Black and Hispanic women, in conservative U.S. states with already limited abortion access. Statistics indicate that women of color, due to factors such as limited healthcare access, low wages, and ineffective sex education, are more likely to seek abortions than white women in these states. Leaders like Tyler Harden from Planned Parenthood argue that abortion restrictions disproportionately burden marginalized women, compounding economic and social disadvantages. This trend is reflected in states like Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama, where minority populations represent a large share of those needing abortions but face significant barriers to access.

The article also explores the anti-abortion movement’s racial dynamics, with some activists framing abortion as a form of racial genocide aimed at Black communities. Some Black anti-abortion advocates, such as Tanya Britton and Alveda King, argue that abortion harms the Black population, claiming that abortion rates in the community are akin to a loss of potential population growth. Critics of this view, however, argue that the movement is exploitative, noting that abortion restrictions place a greater burden on minority women who already face systemic inequities, including inadequate postnatal support and restrictive Medicaid policies.

While proponents of abortion restrictions, like Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, claim these laws protect life and support women, critics argue the policies are racially and economically unjust, disproportionately affecting low-income women who lack alternatives."

Raquel gave birth to twin daughters with Zika syndrome in April 2016. I want to give my best to my daughters, she said in an interview with Human Rights Watch. 2017 Ueslei MarcelinoReuters As Covid-19 dominates headlines, the Zika virus silently continues to put women and children at grave risk in Brazil, and the country has not taken nearly enough steps to combat the mosquito-borne disease or help the families impacted by it. Brazils Ministry of Health identified 579 new suspected cases of Zika between December 2019 and February 2020. A Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other congenital conditions in infants. The 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil disproportionately affected women and girls and amplified longstanding human rights problems, including inadequate access to water and sanitation, unequal access to health care for the poorest families, and restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. The governments response to the outbreak largely failed to address these problems, leaving women and girls at the diseases mercy when it returned. Thousands of infants in northeastern Brazil were born with disabilities linked to the virus and their families have been fighting for their rights ever since. Covid-19 has made matters worse, as states have focused on responding to the coronavirus and, at least in some locations, have cancelled in-person therapy for children affected by Zika. In April 2020, Brazils Supreme Court rejected on a technicality a petition that would have helped those families, without discussing its merits. The case sought access to state benefits, including medical care for families affected by Zika and preventive measures for at-risk populations, as well as access to contraceptives and the right for people infected during pregnancy to choose whether or not to continue their pregnancy. Abortion is legal in Brazil only in cases of rape, when necessary to preserve the life of the woman, or when the fetus has anencephaly. Many pregnant people have to choose between continuing dangerous or unwanted pregnancies or seeking unsafe methods to end them. Pregnant people need access to information and diagnostic tests that show whether a pregnancy could be impacted by Zika, and to safe, legal, and accessible abortion if they decide to end a pregnancy. Basic disease prevention remains out of reach for many Brazilians. More than one-third of Brazils 208 million people do not have access to a continuous water supply. This can be lethal, when frequent handwashing is a cornerstone of Covid-19 prevention and inadequately stored water in households without running water can breed mosquitoes that spread Zika. Brazil should respond to both Covid-19 and Zika by focusing on human rights such as rights to water, sanitation, and to access reproductive health information and services, including legal abortions, contraceptives and prenatal and birth care.

Between December 2019 and February 2020, Brazil reported 579 new suspected Zika cases, which can result in congenital disabilities like microcephaly in infants if contracted during pregnancy. The initial 2015-2016 Zika outbreak revealed systemic problems in Brazil, including poor access to sanitation, healthcare disparities, and limited reproductive rights, particularly affecting marginalized women and girls.

COVID-19 has exacerbated these challenges, diverting resources from Zika response efforts and interrupting essential services for affected families, such as in-person therapy for children with Zika-related disabilities. Furthermore, the Brazilian Supreme Court recently dismissed a petition for expanded support and preventive measures for Zika-impacted families, which sought broader access to medical care, contraceptives, and the right to safe and legal abortion for those affected during pregnancy. Currently, Brazilian law restricts abortion to cases of rape, risks to the mother’s life, or when the fetus has anencephaly, forcing some women into unsafe alternatives.

Lack of basic resources compounds the crisis, with over a third of Brazilians lacking reliable access to water—a necessity for preventing both COVID-19 and Zika. Human Rights Watch calls on Brazil to address these intertwined public health crises through a human rights approach, including improving water and sanitation access and expanding reproductive health services."

ADVERTISEMENTAn EU equality official has criticised the Polish government's decision to ban almost all circumstances of abortion - a decision that has also sparked the country's biggest protests in its post-communist era.Helena Dalli, a Maltese politician serving as equality commissioner, reminded a European Parliament hearing on Wednesday that member states ""must respect fundamental rights.""""As you are well aware, the EU has no competence on abortion rights within a member state and thus, abortion legislation is up to the member states concerned,"" Dalli said. ""However, when making use of the competences, member states must respect fundamental rights which bind them by virtue of the constitutions and commitments under international law.It is also worth noting that both the Council of Europe human rights commissioner, and a group of UN human rights special mechanisms, have expressed the opinion that this substantial restriction to legal access to abortion goes against Poland's international human rights obligations.""The Polish side, however, defended its decision, with representative Andrzej Marek Sados saying it was the ""exclusive responsibility"" of a state to regulate what constitutes a legal termination.He said ""In the Polish legal system, courts and tribunals are an authority that is separate and independent from other authorities. Nonetheless, I would like to point out that in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, health policy remains a competence of the member states.""And it is also the exclusive responsibility of the member states to regulate the issue of the admissibility of the legal termination of pregnancy.""Marta Lempart is the leader of the Polish Women's StrikeCzarek SokolowskiAPThe hearing on Wednesday was also attended by the European Parliament Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality, FEMM, among other committees, and comes after Poland's landmark ruling last year.In October, the Polish constitutional court found it illegal to abort foetuses that have congenital defects.This officially took effect earlier this, making the majority of abortions in Poland illegal.For instance, in 2019, around 98 of all legal abortions were performed on the grounds of foetal malformations.A woman can now only seek a termination legally under Polish law if her life or health is at risk, or if her pregnancy is result of rape or incest.'Bring the government to court'Marta Lempart, a leader of the Polish Women's Strike and who is facing charges for her role in the recent protests, has urged the EU to act and to sanction the Polish government.""Dear European politicians, I am not asking for your concern,"" she said. ""I am not asking for declarations. I demand actions and that is my role and my right. I am a European citizen.""Your duty, first, is to me. To fight for me, the European.

This law has made most abortions illegal, allowing them only if the mother’s life or health is at risk, or in cases of rape or incest. The EU’s equality commissioner, Helena Dalli, emphasized that while abortion laws are under national jurisdiction, member states must still uphold fundamental rights as outlined by international law. The Council of Europe and UN representatives have also stated that Poland’s restrictions violate international human rights standards.

Poland defended its stance, with a representative asserting that abortion regulation is a sovereign right and that health policies fall under each member state’s control per EU treaties. However, activists like Marta Lempart of the Polish Women’s Strike have urged the EU to impose sanctions on Poland, calling for a stronger stance to defend the rights of European citizens. Lempart argued that EU officials have a duty to protect fundamental rights and urged them to act decisively against Poland’s policies.

The ongoing debate underscores tensions within the EU over national sovereignty versus adherence to shared European values and human rights commitments."

Structural racism has always posed formidable barriers to health care for Black people. Black Maternal Health Week highlights a hard truth Black womens needs have never been prioritized, leading to disparate, inequitable health outcomes. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic devastates Black communities across the country, that truth is all the more glaring. ""Time and again, a state or county releases racial data. Time and again, those numbers reveal a sizable racial disparity. Time and again, black Americans are overrepresented among the infected and dead,"" DrIbram writes The Atlantic TheAtlantic April 6, 2020 For Black people, impending motherhood can feel fraught even in normal times because during and after childbirth, their health and lives are on the line. At over 40 deaths per 100,000 live births, the maternal mortality rate for Black women is more than three times higher than that of white women. The work of organizations such as the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, SisterSong, The National Birth Equity Collaborative and other Black-led reproductive justice organizations have brought the Black maternal health crisis to national attention. Since the first commemoration of Black Maternal Health Week in 2018, these organizations efforts have led to the introduction of more than a dozen bills in Congress to rectify the challenges and systemic bias that too often lead to poor maternal health outcomes for Black mamas. Join us by urging your member of Congress to support the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020 introduced by Reps. Lauren Underwood D-Ill. and Alma Adams D-N.C., Sen. Kamala Harris D-Ca., and members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. Among a comprehensive set of regulations and investments to address the crisis in Black womens maternal mortality, the Momnibus Act will compile data on the underlying social determinants that lead to higher mortality rates to address the racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes among Black women in America. The bill is endorsed by over 90 reproductive rights and justice organizations, including Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Planned Parenthood, and Black Womens Health Imperative. While Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health and rights groups have fought targeted attacks against reproductive health care, we recognize that the bulk of the groundbreaking work to defend access to care has been done by reproductive justice organizations and leaders on the ground. Heroes like Dr. Joia Crear-Perry of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, Angela Aina of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Monica Simpson of SisterSong, and Kwajelyn Jackson of the Feminist Womens Health Center have lived and led the work to eradicate disparities and save Black womens lives. We will never have health equity without the reproductive justice framework theyve built. It is clear that the leading cause of Black maternal mortality is racism Studies show link medical professionals tend to take Black women's health concerns less seriously. Anecdotal evidence suggests a pattern of mistreatment and inattention to Black women by medical professionals. Compared to white women, Black women are more likely to have serious complications resulting from pregnancy and less likely to have conditions diagnosed, monitored, and treated in a timely manner. For many Black women, the addition of a doula or similar supporting provider to advocate on behalf of the patient during pregnancy and delivery has improved their health outcomes. Yet COVID-19 has compelled many hospitals to limit the presence of support providers from delivery rooms which may exacerbate existing disparities and increase incidences of mistreatment by providers towards patients. Compared to white women, Black women are more likely to have serious complications resulting from pregnancy and less likely to have conditions diagnosed, monitored, and treated in a timely manner. Racism in the workplace, when accessing housing, in educational settings, and in other community settings the social determinants of health negatively affects Black people. In recent research conducted by Planned Parenthood, Black respondents were most likely to report difficulty paying for basic necessities like food, housing, medical care, and heating. The stress of dealing with racism on a daily basis makes Black women more susceptible to heart disease, high blood pressure, and other chronic health conditions known to contribute to poor maternal health outcomes. What we must also take into account Attacks on access to sexual and reproductive health care also have a disproportionate impact on Black women. The Trump-Pence administration has taken unprecedented steps to roll back access to abortion, block patients from seeking care from the provider of their choice, and institute other restrictions on reproductive health care for millions of people in this country. But obstacles to access are nothing new to Black women, who disproportionately live in states that had barriers to sexual and reproductive health care well before Trump became president. Given the strong link between reproductive health care access and maternal health outcomes, it comes as little surprise that many of those states such as Texas and Georgia also have some of the nations highest maternal death rates. While policymakers work with health care leaders and others to make health care more accessible and affordable for people directly affected by COVID-19, they must pay attention to the causes of death and inequities that affect the Black community even during this pandemic. When we center the communities and people most impacted by health care crises, everyone benefits. These are challenging times, but were in this together. Lets commit to improving the health and wellness of Black mamas, their families, and their communities during this pandemic and beyond.

Black Maternal Health Week 2020 underscores the longstanding inequities Black women face in accessing equitable healthcare, contributing to maternal mortality rates more than three times higher than for white women.

Organizations like Black Mamas Matter Alliance and the National Birth Equity Collaborative advocate for systemic change and have pushed for legislative solutions, such as the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020. This Act, supported by numerous reproductive justice groups, aims to collect data on social determinants affecting maternal health, improve healthcare services, and address disparities specific to Black women.

Racism within healthcare is a significant contributor to these disparities; Black women’s health concerns are often minimized or ignored, leading to higher rates of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Support from doulas has proven beneficial, yet COVID-19 restrictions have limited access to these advocates, increasing risks during childbirth. Additionally, the daily stress of navigating racism exacerbates chronic conditions like hypertension and heart disease, which can impact pregnancy outcomes.

Black women face heightened obstacles to sexual and reproductive health care, with policies in states such as Texas and Georgia imposing stringent limitations that correlate with higher maternal mortality rates. The Trump administration’s actions to restrict abortion and reproductive health services have compounded these challenges.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of centering the voices and needs of Black communities in healthcare discussions. Improving health equity for Black mothers and families can lead to better outcomes for all. Planned Parenthood and other reproductive justice organizations are committed to supporting Black maternal health, advocating for policy changes, and addressing the systemic issues underlying these disparities."

It emphasizes on eliminating maternal deaths due to unsafe abortion, as an important contributor to the reduction of maternal mortality in the African Region. The Initiative focuses on the provision of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights SRHR services within the Universal Health Coverage UHC framework. It focuses on the most vulnerable populations, including those living in humanitarian settings, using a health system strengthening approach. ""The health system strengthening approach of this Initiative is key to address the challenges in the Region. We believe this method can provide lasting benefits, achieving resilient systems of health, contribute towards UHC, and meet the needs of the vulnerable and marginalized groups"" Dr. Geoffrey Bisoborwa, Universal Health CoverageLife Course Cluster Acting Director. This is the second year of implementation of the Initiative. It was therefore imperative to take stock of progress made since 2019 and plan for 2021 hence AFRO organized a virtual review and planning meeting with all the implementing countries on the 3rd December 2020. ""It is important to take stock of the progress made, discuss the challenges to be overcome and identify practical solutions to strengthen the implementation of the initiative to accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development goals, in particular for the reduction of maternal mortality SDG 3.1, universal access to sexual and reproductive health services SDG 3.7 and sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights SDG 5.6."" Dr. Geoffrey Bisoborwa. The four countries selected for initial inclusion in 2019 were Benin, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and South Africa. In mid-2020, Sierra Leone was brought on board as a new focus country for the Initiative. The focus countries of the Initiative are those with a high burden of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortions and who have expressed the need and willingness to expand access to safe abortion, including post-abortion care and post-abortion contraception.

Activists hold placards as they protest in Warsaw against the abortion ban. Alexey VitvitskySputnik via AP CNN Police in Poland used pepper spray against demonstrators after hundreds gathered in the capital of Warsaw to protest a near-total ban on abortions. Polands highest court ruled Thursday that abortions due to fetal defects were unconstitutional. Around 98 of abortions in Poland had been conducted as a result of fetal defects, meaning the ruling bans virtually all terminations taking place in the country. The country already has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe and will now only allow a termination in cases of rape, incest or when the mothers life in danger. The ruling sparked furious protests in the country. On Friday riot police cracked down on crowds which gathered near the home of the ruling Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Kaczynski is the countrys Deputy Prime Minister and widely seen as the de facto decision maker in Poland, despite not being the Prime Minister or President. The move to further restrict abortion had been pursued by Polands populist government for months. Demonstrators gather on July 24, 2020, to protest against plans by the Polish government to leave the Istanbul Convention.

In a second video a group of police officers are seen arresting a protester while another group of officers wrestles with a demonstrator as they try to take him away. A Warsaw police spokesman said Friday that police arrested 15 people at the protests, 14 of whom have been now been released. Authorities issued 35 fine and filed 89 motions in court. Rights groups have reacted with horror to the Polish courts abortion ruling. On Thursday, Amnesty International called the ruling a cruel judgment, saying it was the result of a coordinated, systemic wave of attacks on womens human rights. Legal prohibitions on abortion do not prevent abortion or reduce the rates of abortion they serve only to damage womens health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to travel to foreign countries to access abortion care they need and to which they have a right, Amnesty said in a statement.

The court’s decision declared abortions due to fetal defects unconstitutional, effectively banning the majority of abortions, as 98% of them in Poland had been performed for this reason. This ruling has sparked widespread protests, especially as Poland already has some of Europe’s strictest abortion laws. Abortion will now only be permitted in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is at risk.

The protests have been met with a heavy police response, including the use of pepper spray and arrests. Authorities detained 15 protesters, releasing most of them shortly after. The ruling has drawn criticism from human rights organizations, with Amnesty International calling it a “cruel judgment” and warning that such legal restrictions will only harm women’s health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to seek services abroad.

Wade overturnedLinley SandersData Journalist Politics current affairs Health science March 04, 2020, 830 PM GMT0 Share Printable version On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since President Donald Trump appointed two conservative justices to the nations highest court. The case, June Medical Services v. Russo, will ask the Court to decide whether to uphold a Louisiana state law that requires abortion providers to secure hospital admitting privileges.If the case is upheld, access to abortion would be limited in Louisiana, and other anti-abortion laws would likely be passed in other parts of the country. The court case and the Courts reshaped ideology raises questions about whether the Supreme Court will eventually reevaluate the landmark case that legalized abortion Roe v. Wade. Yet a plurality of Americans even people who call themselves pro-life don't necessarily want Roe overturned, according to a YouGov survey of more than 17,000 Americans.In 1973, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas state law banning all abortion. The decision, also called Roe v. Wade, effectively legalized the procedure nationwide during a woman's first trimester. In the last 47 years, Americans have grown accustomed to the law, and by two to one 49 vs 25, Americans say they do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned.Many somewhat pro-lifers want to keep Roe v. WadeUnderstanding Americans stance on Roe v. Wade is not as simple as looking at their opinion on abortion. Americans who call themselves somewhat pro-life subvert the idea that supporting access to abortion is simply polarized along pro-life and pro-choice lines. For Americans who consider themselves somewhat pro-life, a little more than one-third 37 want Roe upheld and about one-third 33 want it overturned. Three in ten 30 are uncertain of their opinion. But a majority of Americans who call themselves strongly pro-choice or somewhat pro-choice are certain that they do not want Roe v. Wade reversed. Similarly, a majority of those who call themselves strongly pro-life are certain that they do want it overturned. One key trait distinguishes these somewhat pro-lifers from strong pro-lifers somewhat pro-lifers are less likely to be religious than the strongly pro-life. A majority of those who are strongly pro-life 59 say they practice a religion, compared to almost half that number 32 for somewhat pro-lifers. About a quarter 25 of somewhat pro-lifers say they do not belong to a religion, compared to 15 percent of strongly pro-life people.Religious Americans split on whether Roe should be overturnedStrongly pro-life Americans are more likely than the general population to be religious, but not all religious groups want to overturn Roe v. Wade. While Americans who belong to prominent religious groups are generally more likely to want Roe v. Wade overturned when compared to Americans overallits not a guarantee. About half of Roman Catholics 49 say they are either strongly pro-life 31 or somewhat pro-life 18. But despite the fact that Roman Catholics are more likely than the general public to call themselves pro-life, a plurality 43 of Roman Catholics do not want Roe v. Wade overturned. Only one-third of Roman Catholics 31 want it overturned.This pattern generally follows among popular Protestant religions, as well. Americans who put themselves under the umbrella of Protestantism consider themselves more strongly pro-life than the general population 41 vs. 27. But Protestants overall are split on whether Roe v Wade should be overturned 38 percent believe it should and 38 percent believe it should not.There are also denominations of Protestantism that consider themselves more pro-choice than pro-life, primarily the United Church of Christ 67, Episcopalians 65, Methodists 55, Presbyterians 54, and Lutherans 52. Pluralities of each of these religious denominations do not want Roe overturned. In contrast, Nondenominational Americans 61 and Baptists 55 are more likely to consider themselves pro-life than pro-choice. Even with that majority of pro-lifers, fewer than half 45 of Nondenominational Americans want Roe v Wade overturned. Baptists are split on whether it should be overturned or not 34 vs 36.How the states view Roe v. WadeAt the state level, lawmakers often propose abortion-related legislation that could trigger a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade.

All Rights ReservedPrivacy and cookie policyTerms and conditionsDo Not Sell My Info","A YouGov survey of over 17,000 Americans reveals that most Americans, including many who identify as pro-life, do not want the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision overturned. The survey highlights that 49% of Americans oppose overturning Roe, while only 25% support it. The case at hand, June Medical Services v. Russo, will determine whether a Louisiana law limiting abortion access should be upheld, potentially influencing other states’ abortion laws and triggering debates about revisiting Roe v. Wade.

The survey also shows nuanced views among Americans who consider themselves pro-life. Among those who identify as “somewhat pro-life,” about 37% wish to keep Roe v. Wade intact, while 33% want it overturned, and 30% remain uncertain. In contrast, those who strongly identify as pro-choice or somewhat pro-choice overwhelmingly oppose overturning Roe. A significant divide exists between strongly pro-life Americans, who tend to be more religious, and the somewhat pro-life group, who are less likely to be religious.

Religious Americans, particularly Catholics and Protestants, are more likely to lean towards pro-life positions, but even among these groups, opinions on Roe v. Wade are mixed. Roman Catholics, for instance, are divided on the issue, with 43% opposing the overturn and 31% supporting it. The survey also indicates that even in traditionally pro-life states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and Kentucky, a plurality of residents support upholding Roe.

The findings suggest that Americans’ views on abortion are complex, with many wanting to maintain Roe v. Wade while supporting certain restrictions on abortion. This survey, conducted from January 3-5, 2020, reflects the broader debate surrounding abortion and the potential for significant legal shifts depending on future Supreme Court decisions."

Abortion providers say thatll help expand access in rural Kansas, but the legal fight isnt over. WICHITA, Kansas Kansas women could soon be able to seek abortion pills through telemedicine appointments after a judge blocked a state law banning the practice.Abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the decision will help expand access to abortion for people across the state, particularly in areas like western Kansas that might be several hours from the nearest clinic. The states five clinics are clustered around Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas.The decision paves the way for Kansas abortion clinics to expand services to women in remote, underserved areas of Kansas, said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement. The legal status of telemedicine abortion has been tied up in Kansas courts for years, since the Center for Reproductive Rights and Wichita-based clinic Trust Women challenged a 2011 law requiring doctors to be in the same room as patients when prescribing abortion-inducing medication.Last week, Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson granted a temporary injunction barring enforcement of the law. It follows her earlier ruling this summer denying an injunction, which an appellate court overturned.While the legal fight is likely to continue in the Kansas court system, the decision will allow Kansas clinics to offer telemedicine abortion services. Existing restrictions including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and parental consent rules for minors will still apply.Access to telemedicine services for Kansans will go a long way to easing the strain on our reproductive health care systems in the state, Trust Women co-executive director Rebecca Tong said in a statement.Anti-abortion advocates said theyre disappointed by the decision.While its disappointing, its certainly not surprising, said Jeanne Gawdun, director of government relations with Kansans for Life. Its just one of the many limits that are protective for women and their children that abortion providers have fought and will continue to fight.The group said legal challenges to abortion laws like this are possible because voters rejected a constitutional amendment in August that would have stripped abortion protections from the state constitution.It might still be several months before Kansas clinics begin offering telemedicine abortion services.Theres still some infrastructure that needs to be developed in order to successfully roll out a quality telehealth abortion care program, Trust Women spokesperson Zachary Gingrich-Gaylord said.He said the clinic continues to be inundated by out-of-state patients seeking appointments.Right now, our Wichita clinic is focused on trying to see as many people in clinic as possible, he said. We're still receiving far more phone calls than we can answer in a given day.Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates three Kansas clinics, didnt immediately say whether or when it might offer telemedicine abortion services in the future.We applaud this step towards increasing accessibility to abortion services and continue to evaluate our next steps, president and CEO Emily Wales said in a statement.Medication abortion, or the use of the drugs to end a pregnancy, accounts for over two thirds of abortions in Kansas, according to the state health department. Mifepristone and misoprostol, which are often used together, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to end pregnancies up to 10 weeks.Some Kansans have skirted the states telemedicine ban by using overseas pharmacies and mail-forwarding services. Online orders of abortion pills from Europe-based pharmacy Aid Access from Kansas doubled between May and August of this year, according to data released earlier this month.Experts say the rise could be tied to increased difficulty in obtaining abortion appointments in Kansas following the U.S. Supreme Court decision this summer overturning Roe v. Wade, which spurred a wave of abortion bans across the country and sent out-of-state patients to Kansas clinics.Banning telehealth for medication abortion had been something that conservative states had glommed on to starting about a decade ago, said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.Besides Kansas, 18 states have laws banning telemedicine abortions in effect, many of which also ban abortion in most cases. Only seven other states ban telemedicine abortion in instances where it would be legal in person.Kansas is a fairly critical state for abortion access in the country, Nash said. While the decision in this case is very important its also not the end of the road. The case is not finished, and theres certainly more thats going to happen in the Legislature around abortion in the coming years.Rose Conlon reports on health for KMUW and the Kansas News Service.

The law had been challenged by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Wichita clinic Trust Women, which claimed it restricted access to abortion, especially in regions far from the state’s five clinics, clustered in Wichita and Kansas City.

Judge Teresa Watson’s temporary injunction halts the law’s enforcement, although the legal battle is expected to continue. While telemedicine abortion services are now allowed, existing restrictions like a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent for minors remain in place. Abortion rights groups view this as a significant step, especially in a state where medication abortion makes up over two-thirds of all abortions.

However, anti-abortion groups expressed disappointment, calling the decision a setback in protecting women and children. They also noted that the legal challenges were influenced by voters rejecting a constitutional amendment that would have stripped abortion protections in August.

The decision could take months to fully implement as clinics work to establish telemedicine abortion infrastructure. Additionally, some Kansans have already circumvented the telemedicine ban by ordering abortion pills from overseas pharmacies. Despite the ruling, abortion rights groups recognize that the fight for access to reproductive healthcare in Kansas is far from over, as legislative challenges and legal proceedings are likely to continue."
"A year after Roe v. Wade overturned, abortion rights advocacy groups keep fighting ‚Ä¢ Louisiana Illuminator","A year after Roe v. Wade overturned, abortion rights advocacy groups keep fighting Louisiana Illuminator HOME NEWS Election 2024 Govt Politics Environment Health Criminal Justice Education Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 930 News Story CourtsGovt PoliticsHealth Policy A year after Roe v. Wade overturned, abortion rights advocacy groups keep fighting By Josie Abugov, Verite - June 26, 2023 930 am Protestors march toward City Hall in New Orleans to protest the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling June 24, 2022, that overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Louisiana is now trying to develop a list of conditions that would warrant an abortion, despite the states abortion ban. Piper HutchinsonLouisiana Illuminator NEW ORLEANS In its nearly 40 years of existence, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has never offered abortions in Louisiana. The state never authorized the organizations two clinics one in New Orleans and one in Baton Rouge to do so. Planned Parenthood began construction for its South Claiborne Avenue facility in 2015. Its first location, which opened in 1984 on Magazine Street, did not meet the legal code for a facility to provide abortions, so the organization decided to build a new clinic that did. That aim never came to fruition, and the construction process itself was tumultuous. Anti-abortion advocates and the Archdiocese of New Orleans protested and threatened Planned Parenthood. The archbishop even published an open letter vowing not to enter into business relationships with any person or organization that participates in actions that are essential to making this abortion facility a reality. After a controversial building period, the New Orleans Planned Parenthood clinic opened in 2016 and applied for a license under Gov. John Bel Edwards, an anti-abortion Democrat. Planned Parenthood said it heard no response. They never denied it, but they never gave us our license, said Petrice Sams-Abiodun, the vice president of strategic partnerships at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion access in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health, giving the states the authority to ban abortion. The decision overturned a longstanding national right to abortion established in the 1972 Roe v. Wade decision. The decision allowed Louisianas trigger law banning nearly all abortions to take effect immediately, making New Orleans Planned Parenthoods push for a license to perform abortions moot. Before Roe, Louisiana was already an abortion desert In the 40 years between the Roe and Dobbs decisions, Louisiana lawmakers had passed 89 restrictions to abortion access, more than any other state. In 2006, the state legislature passed the trigger ban that would ultimately go into effect with the court ruling 16 years later. The state also instituted a policy banning Medicaid providers from offering abortions, a law that Sams-Abiodun described as a catch-22, since almost 70 percent of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast patients receive Medicaid. There are currently zero abortion clinics operating in Louisiana after the Dobbs decision. But the number had already been dwindling for decades. In 1992, there were 17 clinics. Then, there were 11, then five, then three. We have always looked to the national government. Weve always looked to Roe in Louisiana to be a buffer for us, so that we could have access, even though it was very limited, Sams-Abiodun said. And when that fell, we didnt have anything else. With three abortion clinics in Louisiana prior to the Dobbs ruling, the state was already an abortion desert, but Planned Parenthood could connect patients seeking the procedure to a facility in the state. After the ruling, they expanded an initiative that they had started in Texas to also help people get care outside of Louisiana. We have staff that are specially trained to look at, How far along is the pregnancy? Do you need travel support? Do you want to take a flight? Do you want to drive? Sam-Abiodun said. All these barriers, now, with these laws, are put on the individual. By working with the Planned Parenthood national office and the Louisiana Coalition for Reproductive Freedom an umbrella organization with 30 partners Sams-Abiodun said Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has helped more than 1,500 Louisianians and Texans access out-of-state abortion care. In the 10 months following the Dobbs decision, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has provided more than 650,000 in direct assistance for travel-related costs, such as airfare, lodging, and childcare. But how many other people needed those services? Sams-Abiodun asked. An abortion rights supporter sits outside a New Orleans clinic June 24, 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled its 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade. Its one of three Louisiana abortion clinics that will resume services after a state judge temporarily stopped a state abortion ban from taking effect. Piper HutchinsonLouisiana Illuminator The national landscape Louisiana is now one of 13 states where nearly all abortions are banned. The state has one of the toughest bans in the country. Some states, such as Georgia and West Virginia, have enacted bans that include exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. Louisianas law only allows exceptions when a pregnant persons life or health may be at risk a standard that doctors have said is vague. The states list of conditions that warrant an exception, doctors have complained, fails to reflect the range of health presentations that a person with a nonviable pregnancy might have. An additional four states ban abortion at 15 weeks or earlier, with Georgia banning the procedure at six weeks. These new restrictions had an immediate impact on the number of abortions nationwide. According to a national report released on June 15, there were 25,640 fewer abortions after the Dobbs decision when compared to a pre-Dobbs period. Notably, the surge of abortions in less restrictive states did not account for the reduction in states where the procedure is banned. In Louisiana, there were an average of 785 abortions a month in the two months before Dobbs. From August 2022 through March 2023, the number of abortions in the state has dropped to near zero per month. People of color, low-income communities more vulnerable In the past year, New Orleans-based reproductive justice advocacy groups have been increasing their efforts to promote abortion rights, particularly for the most marginalized groups. Before Dobbs, we had already been doing this same work, especially Black women in the South had always been doing this same exact work, said Elyse Degree, reproductive justice engagement coordinator at Women with a Vision, a nonprofit with programs on reproductive justice, harm reduction, STD prevention, and sex worker advocacy. Now, the organization is striving to amp up visibility through outreach and programming, including their Survival Guide to a Post-Roe Louisiana and weekly library visits with pregnancy tests, emergency contraception, and sexual health resources. The Louisiana Abortion Fund, meanwhile, has spent the past year connecting more than 2,000 callers across 27 states and paying for the travel, clinic, and other associated fees for 1249 people. Their average round-trip to receive an abortion was 891 miles. More than 90 of their callers lived in Southern states where abortion is banned, and more than 75 of their callers were Black. The demographics of the Louisiana Abortion Fund callers reflect statewide and national trends when it comes to abortion, which disproportionately affects Black women and other women of color. I definitely dont want to downplay the significance of the Dobbs decision, but those intersecting difficulties have already been oppressing our people, have already been impacting peoples ability to make a choice for their reproductive health and reproductive futures, said Tyler Barbarin, director of grants and development at the Louisiana Abortion Fund. Last summer, Baton Rouge resident Nancy Davis garnered national attention when she was denied an abortion in Louisiana after learning that the fetus she was carrying had acrania, a fatal condition in which the fetus develops without a skull. Planned Parenthood and a New York abortion fund ultimately covered her procedure and expenses outside support that Davis said she needed. Thank God for a strong support system, because if it wasnt for that, I would not have been able to do it, she said. We have three kids that we have to care for and look after, so you know we didnt have those resources. That was one of the reasons I came out for help. In a sense, it was a cry for help. Acrania was added to the list of medical exceptions to the Louisiana abortion ban earlier this year, but doctors continue to complain that the law creates confusion when treating pregnancy complications and miscarriages. Providing an abortion that does not adhere to the bans specific exceptions holds penalties of up to 20 years in jail and fines of 200,000. Advocates push for legislation Lift Louisiana, an advocacy organization that promotes state policy change, pushed for a bill that the groups executive director Michelle Erenberg said would have made a modest change to the language in the law and addressed doctors confusion over when they can perform a procedure technically considered an abortion. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mary DuBuisson, R-Slidell, was rejected by the state House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee in May. Prior to the Dobbs decision, legislative staff sent abortion-related bills to the House Health and Welfare Committee. But since the overturning of Roe and the outlawing of abortions, these bills have gone to the criminal justice committee, due to abortions being outlawed. This committee is composed of some of the states most conservative representatives. We werent able to get a fair hearing on that legislation. It was all sent to a committee that really has no expertise in these medical issues, Erenberg said. Still, she said that Lift Louisiana is not going to stop their legal fight. The organization plans to bring back the bill in the next legislative session, as well as another recently defeated bill that sought to make exceptions to the abortion ban for cases of rape and incest. In addition to pushing legislation, Erenberg noted that theyre also monitoring trends in other states, adding that if Louisiana isnt the first one, its usually close to follow some of these bad, bad ideas. The recently defeated bills do not seem to align with public opinion on abortion. According to a recent LSU survey, 77 of Louisiana residents believe that abortion should be legal for victims of rape. The Pew Research Center found a rise in support for abortion access in states where bans have taken effect. People may consider themselves pro-life but they do strongly support having more exceptions to the law, Erenberg said. Despite the ongoing efforts of local reproductive justice organizations, Erenberg said that the onslaught of work is not sustainable. Sams-Abiodun echoed that sentiment while stressing the importance of a network of these groups. The services are complementary because the need is so great, she said. One organization cant do this alone. We need the Louisiana Abortion Fund, we need what Lift is doing, we need what Planned Parenthood is doing. And even with that, its still very difficult to get done. For Barbarin, now is the time to increase these advocacy efforts. Were trying to break down systems and address root causes, but also just love on our people, she said. In many ways, this work is committing to not abandoning the South. This is the moment that you need to double down on your commitment and your care for the South, she said. We invite people to continue to do this with us, like even past the one-year mark, even past the five-year mark, well still be here.

Wade in 2022, abortion rights advocacy groups in Louisiana are continuing their fight against restrictive abortion laws. Louisiana, one of the states with the strictest abortion bans, has seen a sharp decline in abortion access. Before the ruling, Louisiana had already limited abortion options, with only three clinics operating in the state. Following the Dobbs decision, the state’s trigger law banned nearly all abortions, and the number of abortions has dropped to near zero.

Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which has never provided abortions in Louisiana, shifted its focus to help patients access abortion care out of state. Through collaborations with national offices and local organizations, it has provided travel assistance for over 1,500 people from Louisiana and Texas, spending over $650,000 on travel-related costs. Despite these efforts, the state’s abortion law remains one of the most restrictive in the country, with few exceptions, creating confusion for medical professionals.

Local organizations, including Women with a Vision and the Louisiana Abortion Fund, are working to provide resources and support to marginalized communities, particularly people of color and those with low incomes. These groups have helped hundreds of individuals cover travel and clinic expenses, but the demand far outstrips their capacity. Advocacy efforts continue to push for legislative change, although efforts have faced setbacks, such as the failure of bills that sought to clarify medical exceptions or expand access in cases of rape or incest.

The ongoing challenges reflect broader issues of systemic inequality, with Black women disproportionately impacted by the abortion ban. Advocacy leaders emphasize the need for continued, coordinated efforts to support those most affected and to fight for future legislative changes, despite the toll it takes on resources and manpower. The battle for abortion rights in Louisiana is seen as part of a larger commitment to support reproductive justice in the South."
Louisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban ‚Ä¢ Louisiana Illuminator,"Louisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban Louisiana Illuminator HOME NEWS Election 2024 Govt Politics Environment Health Criminal Justice Education Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 1743 News Story HealthHealth CareHealth PolicyLegislative Louisiana proposes expanding list of exceptions to abortion ban A pregnancy could be terminated if fetus is missing a skull, under proposed health rule By Julie O'Donoghue - October 19, 2022 543 pm Photo by Astrid RieckenGetty Images Louisiana has proposed adding one new condition to the list of medical diagnoses that permit a person to have an abortion under the states strict abortion ban. It comes after a woman complained publicly that she couldnt terminate her compromised pregnancy. The state Department of Health quietly suggested an update to state abortion regulations in September that would put acrania a disorder where a fetus develops without a complete skull in the group of medically futile pregnancy conditions that can justify an abortion under state law. The change was proposed about a month after Nancy Davis told reporters she had been denied an abortion at Womans Hospital in Baton Rouge for a fetus diagnosed with acrania. The condition results in miscarriage, stillbirth or a very short lifespan for an infant born after the prognosis. Davis said Womans Hospital in Baton Rouge told her it could not end her pregnancy because of Louisianas abortion ban that went into effect last summer. She ended up traveling to New York in early September to undergo the procedure. Womans Hospital has not responded to a request for comment for this story. Slow process to add exceptions Adding acrania to the states medically futile pregnancy conditions list would change that dynamic moving forward. Once it is on the list, a person with a pregnancy affected by acrania should be able to get to an abortion, and a hospital could provide one without question. Still, the process for putting acrania on that list is slow-going. The health department has opted to update the states abortion regulations through a process that takes at least four months and often as long as six or seven months. Officials decided not to use an emergency process that would add acrania to the list immediately. I am very pleased they are adding acrania to the medically futile conditions list, but it should be added as an emergency item immediately, Davis said in an interview. There are women who are in underserved communities who need access to medical care and they need access now. The health department, which is in charge of drafting and amending abortion regulations, has not answered questions about why it wants to add acrania to the pregnancy conditions list. Health Secretary Courtney Phillips declined in person last month to respond to a reporters question about whether state abortion regulations would be updated. Instead, she referred the reporter to her agencys communications department. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX Confusion in state law There is confusion about whether acrania diagnoses could currently justify an abortion under a catch-all exception included in Louisianas abortion regulations. After Davis case garnered media attention, state Sen. Katrina Jackson, D-Monroe, and several other anti-abortion legislators released a written statement saying Womans Hospital grossly misinterpreted Louisianas abortion policies. Jackson helped write the states strict abortion ban, including the statute that provides for exceptions for medically futile pregnancies. Abortions are allowed if a fetus has a profound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly that is inconsistent with sustaining life after birth, according to a state regulation. The lawmakers said this provision should have applied to Davis case. The law in conjunction with the emergency rule is very clear that this young lady is within the exception, lawmakers said in their statement. Jackson said health officials told her in August that an acrania diagnosis would justify an abortion. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel sent a general statement Monday that suggested that might be the case, but stopped short of confirming what Jackson said. This is an evolving document and LDH has always said that the list would not be able to encompass every possible diagnosis that would meet the definition of medically futile, Neel wrote. That is why the current regulation does and the final regulation will provide for physician certification of other conditions that would allow for termination. LDHs final rule will include acrania. Emergency option The confusion over acranias status may be cleared up if health officials added it to the medically futile condition list immediately. Regulations can be adopted or amended on an emergency basis under state law if they prevent an imminent peril to the public health, safety or welfare. The current list that doesnt include acrania was established under an emergency rule in August. The health department hasnt answered questions about why it isnt using that process to update the list. State officials routinely approve or amend emergency regulations. Recent emergency rules include those that closed the red snapper fishing and oyster harvesting seasons as well as adjustments to the minimum qualifications for a licensed teacher. In August and September alone, there were 10 new state emergency rules adopted, including one to establish weight classes for London Ring Fighting, described as the sport of boxing conducted without the use of boxing gloves or other padding on the participants hands. In recent years, legislators have complained that state officials, particularly those in the health department, use the emergency regulation process too often. It allows state agencies to initially bypass the public hearing and comment period required before a regulation can be permanently adopted, which makes some lawmakers uneasy. Acrania is unlikely to be the only new condition proposed for the medically futile list. Doctors have already said other illnesses will come up regularly that might justify the termination of a pregnancy. The health department will never be able to think of everything because medicine doesnt work like that, said Dr. Rebekah Gee, an obstetriciangynecologist based in New Orleans and the former head of the Louisiana Department of Health. You will never be able to come up with a complete list. Anti-abortion advocates could also push back on adding more conditions. The states leading anti-abortion organizations didnt want the state to allow as many exceptions to the abortion ban in the first place. They unsuccessfully fought to take the language that created the medically futile pregnancy conditions list out of the law before it was approved last spring. We were not excited about this list, said Gene Mills, head of Louisiana Family Forum, a conservative Christian organization. I think it creates as an illustrative list does winners and losers, and there are always unintended consequences in doing that. Some anti-abortion advocates said conditions expected to be fatal to an infant, including acrania, do not justify abortion because they believe it amounts to ending a life prematurely. We know that it is a heartbreaking situation, and we know people who have been through similar circumstances who have chosen to carry the baby to term. Sometimes the child can live much longer than the medical diagnosis predicts, said Benjamin Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, the states leading antiabortion organization. We are certainly not making light of this in any way, Clapper said. Its a heroic thing to love that child until the end. SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

This proposed change came after a woman, Nancy Davis, publicly shared her experience of being denied an abortion for a pregnancy diagnosed with acrania, despite the condition typically resulting in stillbirth or a very short lifespan for the infant. Davis ultimately sought an abortion in New York.

Currently, abortions in Louisiana are allowed under certain exceptions, such as when a fetus has severe, life-threatening conditions. However, there has been confusion over whether acrania qualifies under the existing law. Some lawmakers, including State Senator Katrina Jackson, have argued that acrania should have been covered under the medically futile pregnancy exception, as the condition is incompatible with sustaining life.

Despite this, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) is slowly moving through the process of adding acrania to the official list of medically futile conditions, a process that could take several months. This update, while a step forward, has been met with calls for a faster response, with some advocates urging for an emergency rule to address the issue more quickly.

Opponents of broader abortion exceptions, including anti-abortion groups, argue that conditions like acrania should not justify abortion, as they believe in preserving life as long as possible, regardless of medical prognosis. These groups also opposed the initial creation of the medically futile pregnancy conditions list.

The situation underscores ongoing debates in Louisiana over the limits of abortion exceptions, with further discussions expected as other medical conditions might be proposed for inclusion."

On June 1, 2020, the Health Ministry published a technical note highlighting the difficulties women and girls may encounter in getting sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic and suggested measures to improve access. Two days later, President Jair Bolsonaro distorted the notes content in a tweet, saying that the ministry was trying to identify its authors and did not support any proposal to legalize abortion. The ministry then removed two of the three public servants who signed the note from leadership positions. The Brazilian health system is under strain because of Covid-19, but women and girls who need abortions cant wait until the end of the pandemic, said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, Americas acting deputy director at Human Rights Watch. Instead of ensuring that women and girls have access to essential health care and support during this crisis, President Bolsonaro ignored expert guidelines, lied about a Health Ministry document that recommended improving services, and punished the officials who signed it. As of June 11, Brazil had 800,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and about 41,000 deaths.Several news reports in Brazil have suggested that some local authorities have suspended sexual and reproductive services considered not urgent, including providing contraception, during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, only 42 hospitals, in a country of about 210 million people, are currently performing legal abortions, according to a study conducted by the nonprofit Article 19 and news sites AzMina and Gnero e Nmero. In 2019, it was 76 hospitals. On June 1, three offices within the Health Ministry, including the Office of Coordination of Womens Health, jointly published Technical Note 162020, with support from the Pan American Health Organization PAHO, which serves as Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization WHO. The note was posted on a Health Ministry website. The five-page note underscored the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on access to health services for vulnerable populations, particularly poor women and girls. It warned that women and girls may not have access to contraceptives and also may suffer increased gender-based violence during the pandemic, leading to unwanted pregnancies. It said that the authorities should make all possible efforts to maintain sexual and reproductive health services to prevent causing important and irreparable harm to womens comprehensive health. Among those essential services it listed services for victims of sexual violence access to contraception, particularly emergency contraception prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and access to safe abortion in the cases contemplated by Brazilian law. Abortion is legal in Brazil in cases of rape, when necessary to save a womans life, or when the fetus has anencephaly, a fatal congenital brain disorder. Human Rights Watch has urged Brazilian authorities to decriminalize abortion and ensure access to safe abortion and post-abortion care, in line with its obligations under international human rights law. On June 4, the Health Ministry acknowledged in a statement that its Office of Coordination of Womens Health had written the note. But it claimed that the note was not discussed within the Ministry of Health and said that the ministry had initiated disciplinary proceedings to identify those responsible for writing and publishing it. The next day, the acting health minister removed two of the people who signed the note from their positions as coordinators for womens health and for life cycles, respectively. Both are public servants, who can only be fired if they commit a crime or a serious infraction. They continue to work for the ministry in lower-level positions.In a joint letter released on June 6, 98 civil society organizations, including Human Rights Watch, rejected the governments distortion of the notes content and expressed their solidarity with the two public servants who suffered reprisals and all other employees of the Health Ministry who are trying to ensure high quality public health.The WHO has warned that reductions in the availability of essential sexual and reproductive health care, including maternal and newborn health services, around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic will result in many thousands of maternal and newborn deaths due to millions of additional unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and complicated deliveries without access to essential and emergency care. The WHO has recommended that governments prioritize ensuring access to contraception, abortion to the full extent allowed by law, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, many pregnant women and girls in Brazil had to choose between continuing dangerous or unwanted pregnancies or seeking unsafe methods to end them. A case challenging the criminalization of abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is pending before the Supreme Court. In a different case, in April, the court rejected on a technicality a petition to allow pregnant women infected with the Zika virus, which can cause microcephaly and other harm when a fetus is exposed in utero, to choose whether to continue their pregnancy. In both cases, Human Rights Watch submitted amicus briefs arguing that Brazils abortion laws are incompatible with its human rights obligations under international law.

On June 1, 2020, Brazil’s Ministry of Health issued a technical note acknowledging the challenges women and girls face in accessing sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic. The note emphasized the importance of maintaining services like contraception, safe abortion, and care for victims of sexual violence.

However, after the Ministry of Health released the note, President Jair Bolsonaro distorted its message and downplayed its support for abortion services, claiming the note sought to legalize abortion. This led to the removal of two public servants who had signed the document from their leadership positions. This action drew criticism from civil society groups, including Human Rights Watch, who condemned the distortion of the note’s content and the retaliation against the officials.

The pandemic exacerbated existing issues, such as a decline in the availability of sexual and reproductive health services. Only 42 hospitals in Brazil were performing legal abortions, down from 76 in 2019. Moreover, with the pandemic’s strain on healthcare, vulnerable groups like low-income women and girls were increasingly unable to access essential services, potentially leading to unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.

Human Rights Watch has been advocating for Brazil to decriminalize abortion and ensure safe access to abortion care in line with international human rights law. They have also submitted briefs in cases challenging Brazil’s restrictive abortion laws in the Supreme Court.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of global consequences due to the reduction of essential healthcare during the pandemic, which could result in increased maternal deaths and unsafe abortions. Human Rights Watch continues to call for the prioritization of sexual and reproductive health services during this crisis."

Abortion rights supporters chant during rally in Tucson, Arizona, on July 4, 2022. Sandy HuffakerAFPGetty Images CNN An Arizona Superior Court judge ruled Friday that a 1901 ban on nearly all abortions in that state can be enforced, a decision that is likely to see an appeal and is all but certain to galvanize female voters to turn out in greater numbers in the states closely contested US Senate and governors races. In ruling that Arizonas near-total ban on abortion could take effect, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson granted a request by the states Republican attorney general to lift a court injunction that had barred enforcement of Arizonas pre-statehood ban on abortion after the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973. The court finds that because the legal basis for the judgment entered in 1973 has now been overruled, it must vacate the judgment in its entirety, Johnson wrote in the ruling released Friday. The case has thrust the issue of how restrictive abortion law should be in Arizona, a swing state that President Joe Biden carried by fewer than 11,000 votes. Its a controversial topic that has divided Republicans in Arizona and is reflective of a pitched debate nationwide in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in late June, with many GOP-led states passing increasingly restrictive measures that run the risk of alienating moderate voters. The judges ruling effectively outlaws all abortions in Arizona except when the procedure is necessary to save the mothers life. The decision came a day before a 15-week ban on abortion was slated to go into effect in Arizona. That law was passed by Arizona lawmakers before the US Supreme Court decision. Indiana Senator Susan Glick, author of Senate Bill 1, debates Senator Greg Taylor shortly before the vote to accept Senate Bill 1, which was passed by the House earlier in the day, making the Indiana legislature the first in the nation to restrict abortions, in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. August 5, 2022. REUTERSCheney Orr Cheney OrrReuters Related article Abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states. Here's where things stand Conservative Arizona lawmakers included language in the bill banning abortion after 15 weeks stating that the new legislation would not override the 1901 law which was passed before Arizona became a state and can be traced back to as early as 1864. In addition to barring abortion in all cases except when it is necessary to save the mothers life, the pre-statehood law carries a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers. While fighting the attorney generals move to allow the 1901 abortion ban to be enforced, abortion rights groups had argued that if both laws were to go into effect, it would create significant confusion for both abortion providers and women seeking care. But the judge said in her ruling that she was not weighing in on how the conflict between Arizonas abortion laws would be settled. While there may be legal questions the parties seek to resolve regarding Arizona statutes on abortion, those questions are not for this Court to decide here, Johnson wrote in the decision. The ruling drew a swift rebuke from several Democratic groups that favor abortion rights and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Katie Hobbs, who said she was outraged and devastated by the decision. Theres no doubt in my mind that this draconian 1901 law will have dire consequences on the health and well-being of Arizona women and their families, Hobbs said in a statement. This cruel law effectively outlaws abortion in Arizona with no exceptions for rape or incest and risks womens fundamental freedom to make their own health care decisions. To make matters worse, this law mandates jail time for abortion providers. Medical professionals will now be forced to think twice and call their lawyer before providing patients with oftentimes necessary, lifesaving care. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre criticized the Arizona court ruling as catastrophic, dangerous and unacceptable. Make no mistake this backwards decision exemplifies the disturbing trend across the country of Republican officials at the local and national level dead-set on stripping women of their rights, including through South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Grahams proposed national abortion ban, she said in a statement. Arizona GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who led the legal process to try to get the states pre-statehood ban on abortion put back into effect after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in late June, tweeted that he was pleased by the decision We applaud the court for upholding the will of the legislature and providing clarity and uniformity on this important issue. I have and will continue to protect the most vulnerable Arizonans, he tweeted. The disagreement over Arizonas abortion laws has created a confusing legal landscape in Arizona for much of the summer that has unfolded against the backdrop of a shifting national political mood ahead of Novembers midterm elections. While both historical trends and the nations sour mood about inflation had initially appeared to favor Republicans in their quest to take control of the US House and Senate this November, the Supreme Courts decision on abortion has energized female voters all over the country a dynamic that led to the surprising victory for proponents of abortion rights in Kansas and better-than-expected performances for Democrats in special elections for the US House since the Dobbs ruling. The ruling injects a new uncertainty into the marquee statewide races. Republicans, who need a net gain of just one seat to flip the Senate, are trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly as he runs for a full six-year term. And Democrats are trying to flip the governors mansion, currently held by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. In the Arizona governors race, Hobbs has portrayed GOP opponent Kari Lake as extreme on abortion. Lake has repeatedly said she is opposed to the procedure and in an August news conference said that she would uphold the laws that are on the books. But she did not specify which laws she meant. If people dont like the laws on the books, then they need to elect representatives who will change the laws. Im running for governor, not for God. So I dont get to write the laws, she said. Her campaign has not responded to CNNs requests for clarification on her view of the pre-statehood law. Both Lake and GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters, who is challenging Kelly, have argued that their Democratic opponents have adopted positions that are too far out of the mainstream in favor of abortion rights. Masters removed language from his campaign website expressing support for a federal personhood law and other conservative anti-abortion stances after winning the GOP nomination last month. His campaign told CNN that Masters does support Grahams proposal for a federal ban on abortion at 15 weeks, which would provide exceptions to protect the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest. But before the ruling, Masters campaign did not respond to questions about his position on the pre-statehood law or the court case to enforce it. In a statement Friday, Kelly said the decision would have a devastating impact on the freedom Arizona women have had for decades to choose an abortion if they need one. Lets be clear, this is exactly what Blake Masters wants, to completely ban abortions in Arizona and across the country without even an exception for rape or incest. I will never stop fighting to restore these rights for Arizona women. Planned Parenthood Federation of America fought Brnovichs move in Pima County Superior Court the court that handled the 1973 injunction. The groups lawyers had argued that the court had a duty to harmonize all of the Arizona Legislatures enactments as they exist today. In the post-Dobbs era, the group argued that the pre-statehood law could be enforceable in some respects but that it should not apply to abortions provided by licensed physicians and instead that the ban should apply to anyone other than a licensed physician who attempts to provide abortion services. In a statement, Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona, said Fridays ruling has the practical and deplorable result of sending Arizonans back nearly 150 years. No archaic law should dictate our reproductive freedom and how we live our lives today. This story has been updated with a statement from the White House on Saturday.

Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans 2016 Cable News Network.","An Arizona judge has ruled that the state can enforce a near-total abortion ban that dates back to 1901, allowing only exceptions when necessary to save the mother’s life. This decision came after the Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected abortion rights nationwide. The ruling effectively nullifies a 1973 injunction that had blocked the 1901 law, and it applies even as a separate 15-week abortion ban was set to take effect.

The ruling is part of a broader debate over abortion laws in Arizona, a key swing state, which has seen a shift in political dynamics since the Roe v. Wade decision. The judge’s decision was met with swift backlash from abortion rights supporters, including Democratic candidates like Katie Hobbs, who criticized the law for its harsh consequences on women’s health and freedoms. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also condemned the ruling as “catastrophic” and part of a larger, troubling trend across Republican-led states.

Arizona’s Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who had pushed to reinstate the 1901 law, expressed approval of the ruling, claiming it upholds the will of the state legislature. However, the ruling has raised confusion over the legal landscape for abortion in Arizona, especially as the state approaches critical midterm elections. Abortion rights groups, such as Planned Parenthood, plan to continue challenging the decision.

The decision has become a significant point of contention in Arizona’s gubernatorial and Senate races, with both Democratic and Republican candidates framing the issue as central to the upcoming elections. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly and gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs have voiced strong opposition to the decision, while Republican candidates like Kari Lake and Blake Masters have downplayed their positions on the pre-statehood law. The ruling, which is expected to energize voters, particularly women, will likely play a significant role in the state’s elections."

To do so would betray the very purpose of the institution. The university says its tweets saying an investigation was underway were inartfully worded. FIRE thanks UK for the timely response. Student to demonstrator Sorry! First Amendment, man. FIRE in letter to UK Yeah. What she said. The viral video spans just 22 seconds. But the stain on the University of Kentuckys reputation for threatening a lawful student protest on its public campus may last far longer. FIRE wrote to UK this afternoon urging it to immediately reverse course after it tweeted yesterday that it will investigate a group of four students who displayed mocking behavior toward a pro-life demonstrator. Or as we here at FIRE like to call it Fully protected, core political speech. In the video which was apparently taken last fall but went viral just yesterday the students are seen standing in front of a pro-life demonstrators sign which depicts an aborted fetus doing a roughly choreographed dance, and then grabbing their bags to leave. One of the women turns to the man and says, Sorry. No uterus, no opinion. She momentarily extends her middle finger and walks away, before turning back a final time to add Actually, I promise Id kill my baby if I got pregnant. One of the other students chimes in I literally would! Are you kidding me? No uterus, no opinion. At one point, another student shouts in feigned remorse to the demonstrator Sorry. First Amendment, man. Thats the essence of FIREs letter to UK, reminding the public, land-grant institution that not only does the First Amendment protect this kind of basic, political counter-protest, but so does Kentucky state law, which mandates that UK maintain policies that uphold the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, learn, and discuss any issue, and a marketplace of ideas where the free exchange of ideas is not suppressed because an idea put forth is considered by some or even most of the members of the institutions community to be offensive, unwise, disagreeable, conservative, liberal, traditional, or radical. The Kentucky law also bans unreasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of student speech that occurs in the outdoor areas of campus or is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. As we explain The students expressive conduct here is wholly protected by the First Amendment, does not constitute unlawful fighting words or harassment, and cannot be investigated or restricted on the basis that some may find it offensive. The First Amendment protects the display of the middle finger. Indeed, the display of the middle finger is so plainly protected by the First Amendment that officials who penalize such expressive activity have been held personally liable for violating clearly established constitutional rights. Citations omitted. Read more about the expressive qualities of middle fingers here. We also note that even mere investigations, without additional punishment, violate the First Amendment when an officials act would chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment activities. Even critics of the students expression have recognized it is plainly protected. Sorry. First Amendment, man. Mark Harrington, president of the pro-life group Created Equal, told local media today that it was his group that the students were confronting and that he flatly opposes UK investigating them. Free speech is a cornerstone of our republic, and we oppose universities investigating students for their free expression, Harrington told WTVQ. The university can play a role in teaching students to have respectful dialogue with those they disagree with. The universitys Twitter account responded to the video yesterday within roughly an hour, so we know theyre ready to spring into action when a policy violation occurs. Weve given the university until close-of-business tomorrow to confirm that it will publicly rescind its investigation threat and take steps to make sure this doesnt happen again.

The video, which emerged in early February 2022, shows four students confronting the demonstrator, mocking his pro-life message with remarks like “No uterus, no opinion” and other statements about abortion. One student also displayed a middle finger in the interaction.

In response, UK initially tweeted about investigating the incident, but quickly clarified that it was not pursuing an investigation, admitting that the wording was unclear. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) issued a letter urging UK to reverse its stance, emphasizing that the students’ actions were protected by the First Amendment and Kentucky state law, both of which guarantee free speech on public university campuses.

FIRE pointed out that even expressions such as the middle finger are constitutionally protected. Penalizing or investigating students for this kind of speech could chill future expression, violating their First Amendment rights. FIRE’s letter also highlighted that UK’s own policies, along with state law, require the university to uphold broad free speech protections and prevent unreasonable restrictions on student expression.

The pro-life demonstrator involved in the incident, Mark Harrington, also opposed any investigation, stating that the university should focus on fostering respectful dialogue, not suppressing free expression. FIRE called on UK to publicly retract its investigation threat and ensure that such actions would not occur again, urging the university to prioritize its commitment to free speech."

Israel-Hamas war First day of spring Unilever job cuts Haiti gang violence Elon Musk Nebraska governor signs 12-week abortion ban, limits on gender-affirming care for minors The Nebraska Legislature on Friday approved a 12-week abortion ban and restrictions on gender-affirming care for children in a move so contentious that lawmakers on both sides have said they may be unable to work together in the future. May 18 AP Video by Nick Ingram AP produced by Javier Arciga Photos 5 By Margery A. Beck and Josh Funk Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print LINCOLN, Neb. AP Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a bill Monday that bans abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy and restricts gender-affirming medical care for people younger than 19.The abortion ban takes effect immediately, while the ban on gender-affirming care takes effect on Oct. 1. The hybrid measure ties together restrictions that Republicans have pursued across the U.S.Pillen called the law the most significant win for social conservative agenda in over a generation of Nebraska before he signed the law while holding the 5-day-old daughter of some friends as his two oldest granddaughters stood next to him.Its about protecting our kids and saving babies. Pure and simple, Pillen said. Opponents have promised to sue to try and block the law. The head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, Mindy Rush Chipman, said in a statement that every option is on the table to undo these regressive measures. The governors decision to sign these sweeping restrictions into law betrays a total disregard for Nebraskans freedom, health and well-being, Rush Chipman said. Just as we have seen in other states, these bans will result in significant harm, most intensely hurting already vulnerable communities. READ MORE A new kind of hospital is coming to rural America. To qualify, facilities must close their beds Nebraska governor blames university leadership for AD Trev Alberts sudden departure for Texas AM Trev Alberts is leaving Nebraska to become Texas AMs athletic director Nebraska had not passed a new abortion ban since 2010, when it became the first state to limit the procedure at around 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 12-week ban includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who pursued even tougher abortion restrictions during the session, wiped away tears as she said she hopes to eventually enact a ban at all stages of pregnancy.Planned Parenthood, which operates two of Nebraskas three abortion clinics, said the new law increases the burden on women who need abortions, forcing more of them to travel out of state. Its heartbreaking that we have to tell patients that they cannot receive their health care here in Nebraska anymore, said Andi Curry Grubb, Nebraska executive director for Planned Parenthood North Central States.The law forced Planned Parenthood to reschedule three patients this week, and Curry Grubb said that within her five-state region, there has been a 40 increase in second-trimester abortions since Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer. More women are being forced to push abortions later into pregnancy because of hurdles involved with seeking care out of state. She said its troubling that the new law doesnt include any exception for fetal anomalies, which may not be diagnosed until after the 12th week of pregnancy.North Carolina also recently passed a 12-week abortion ban, among a slew of restrictions enacted in states after the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. Fourteen states have approved an abortion ban throughout pregnancy.Nebraskas law also will prevent transgender people under 19 from receiving any gender-confirming surgery. It restricts the use of hormone treatments and puberty blockers in minors, putting the states chief medical officer a political appointee who is an ear, nose and throat doctor in charge of setting the rules for those therapies. In Nebraska, people younger than 19 are considered minors. The states unicameral Legislature passed the bill with the two contentious issues on Friday after hours of heated debate. Conservative lawmakers wrangled just enough votes to end a filibuster before approving the bill. The proposal restricting gender-affirming care was the flashpoint of an epic filibuster led by Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh. She and a handful of progressive allies slowed the business of passing laws to a crawl by introducing amendment after amendment to every bill that made it to the Senate floor. That sent leadership scrambling to prioritize which bills to push through. Omaha Sen. Kathleen Kauth, who introduced the proposal restricting gender-affirming care, said Monday that the filibuster actually gave senators more time to discuss and research the issue. The filibuster actually is what made this happen, Kauth said. And so I doubt it was their intention, but that gave us the time to make this work.Nebraska is now among at least 18 states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for minors. Proposals are pending before the governors of Texas and Missouri. Medical groups and advocates say such restrictions are further marginalizing transgender youth and threatening their health.One Nebraska lawmaker, Omaha state Sen. Megan Hunt, disclosed in March that her teenage son is transgender and said Friday that she now plans to leave the state.Pillen said he didnt want Nebraska families considering gender-affirming medical care to be duped into the silliness that if you do this, youre going to become happy. Funk contributed to this story from Omaha, Neb. Josh Funk Josh covers railroads Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway mailto","On May 20, 2024, Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed a law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and imposes restrictions on gender-affirming medical care for minors. The law is a significant win for social conservatives and has been met with strong opposition. The abortion ban includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. Planned Parenthood expressed concerns that the law will force women to seek abortions out of state, especially for later-term procedures.

Additionally, the law prohibits transgender individuals under 19 from accessing gender-affirming surgeries and restricts hormone treatments and puberty blockers. The bill also empowers the state’s chief medical officer to regulate these treatments. This law, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, makes Nebraska one of 18 states that have enacted similar restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors.

The law was passed after a contentious debate in the state legislature, with a significant filibuster led by progressive senators. Supporters of the law, including Governor Pillen, argue that it is aimed at protecting children and preventing harmful medical practices. However, opponents, including the ACLU of Nebraska, warn that the measures will harm vulnerable communities and undermine individual freedoms."

While many students at our school hold pro-life values considering their religion, its still important to provide opportunities to discuss pro-life apologetics so students can defend their beliefs. One of our groups most popular apologetics events is National Pro-Life Chalk Day, where we chalk pro-life art and sayings on the sidewalk in front of our school building. Heres how we switched things up this year and the reaction it received We wanted to hold something like a Cemetery of the Innocents display where crosses or flags are put out to memorialize preborn children lost to abortion to inform our student body of the widespread effects of abortion and to show them that, despite Roe v. Wade being reversed and the loss of the Value Them Both Amendment, abortion is a prevalent issue in our state and nation. Thats why for National Pro-Life Chalk Day this fall, our SFLA group, Heritage Students for Life, chalked 2,363 hearts on the sidewalk in front of our school to represent the 2,363 preborn children killed in the United States daily by abortion. We had thirteen students come out to help, and it took us thirty minutes to chalk all of the hearts. We also created posters sharing what the hearts represented and directed students to Live Actions website 2363.org. Our display caused quite a bit of discussion among our school community which is exactly what we had hoped for. We focused our conversations on the violence of abortion and the scale at which it occurs, especially in our community. Not many people who live in our city know that there are two abortion facilities nearby that perform abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy, or that the abortion industry in Kansas has been booming due to travelers from other states with more stringent abortion restrictions coming to Kansas. We challenged students to define their position on abortion, and we had four new students who were interested in joining us in our mission to make abortion inaccessible and unthinkable. They became members of our group, and we are excited to have them. At our school, we have lots of students who hold pro-life convictions, but many do not know how to put those beliefs into practice. Our display helped students get plugged into pro-life activism and supportive services, and the response that the student body had makes me hopeful for the pro-life movement in Kansas and throughout the nation.

The author discusses an event organized by the Heritage Students for Life group at Heritage Christian Academy in Kansas.

For National Pro-Life Chalk Day, the group chalked 2,363 hearts on the sidewalk to represent the daily number of preborn children lost to abortion in the U.S. They aimed to educate their peers about the ongoing prevalence of abortion, especially in Kansas, where the industry is expanding due to increased out-of-state demand. The event was designed to raise awareness about the violence of abortion and to provoke discussions among students, many of whom were unaware of the abortion facilities near their community.

The display not only spurred important conversations but also led to four new members joining the pro-life group. The event served as a valuable tool for helping students translate their pro-life beliefs into activism. The author expresses hope for the future of the pro-life movement, both within Kansas and nationally, underscoring the need for continued efforts to make abortion “inaccessible and unthinkable.”"

Photo by Michael B. ThomasGetty Images. For decades, Republicans promised voters theyd ban abortions if only the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade. Sure enough, abortion was swiftly banned in Republican-controlled states around the country in the wake of the courts June decision striking down Roe. But a public backlash evident in polls, a Kansas ballot question and several special elections around the country has Republicans often looking to change the subject before the fall election. Not Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., though, who recently introduced a bill to ban abortion nationally after 15 weeks. States would also be allowed to enact stricter bans. Minnesota remains a safe haven for abortion rights in the upper Midwest under the state Supreme Court case Doe v. Gomez, but that could change with a federal ban. Heres where the 16 candidates for U.S. House stand on Grahams abortion proposal District 1 Rep. Brad Finstad, R Finstad did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill, but he has previously stated he is anti-abortion and believes the states should decide abortion rights. Jeff Ettinger, DFL Ettinger went to Twitter after the news of Grahams bill broke, calling the bill an egregious threat to womens rights. Ettinger has stated he wants to codify Roe into national law. Ettinger lost the First District special election to Finstad in August by 4 percentage points and will face Finstad again in November. District 2 Rep. Angie Craig, DFL Craig also took to Twitter to criticize Grahams bill on Sept. 14. We need to codify Roe ensure women not government are in charge of their own healthcare decisions, Craig said. Tyler Kistner, R Craigs Republican competitor Kistner did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. In 2020, Kistners stance on abortion was 100 pro-life, something he is now trying to distance himself from. A Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life survey from this summer showed Kistner said he would uphold anti-abortion laws. In a Star Tribune article published Wednesday, Kistner called abortion an extremely complex issue, but did not expand. District 3 Rep. Dean Phillips, DFL Phillips opposes Grahams bill. In response, Phillips introduced the PRO-LIFE Act, which is a set of bills to invest in maternal and childrens health, paid leave and adoption support. Rep. Phillips has been a vocal advocate for womens reproductive freedom, Phillips spokesperson Sam Anderson said. Tom Weiler, R Weiler did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. After Roe was overturned, Weiler issued a statement saying, We have a duty to care for the most vulnerable among us from the very beginning of life until the end. He has stated he would support laws that allow for abortion in the cases of rape, incest or if the mothers health is at risk. District 4 Rep. Betty McCollum, DFL McCollum responded to Grahams bill via Twitter on Sept. 13. Now that places like Kansas are deciding to protect reproductive rights, extreme Republicans are proposing a national abortion ban to control women, McCollum said. We must keep fighting to DefendWomensRights reproductive rights. May Lor Xiong, R Xiong said the states should make abortion access decisions. Keeping this debate closest to the people is where this issue should remain, Xiong said. District 5 Rep. Ilhan Omar, DFL Omar also responded to Grahams bill via Twitter on Sept. 13 saying, Roe was just the tip of the iceberg. Republicans have now made it plain as day that they do not just want to keep state abortion bans in place, but that they will ban abortions nationwide if they seize power. Cicely Davis, R Davis did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill, but she told the Star Tribune that abortion access is protected in Minnesota and she respects life from conception to death. District 6 Rep. Tom Emmer, R Emmer did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. Every life is precious, and the decision to defend it should remain with the states, Emmer said after Roe was overturned. But Emmer also co-sponsored the Heartbeat Protection Act, which was introduced in Congress in February 2021. The bill would prohibit an abortion if a doctor detects cardiac activity from the fetus, which can happen as soon as six weeks, before many women know theyre pregnant. Jeanne Hendricks, DFL Hendricks did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill specifically but has stated she wants to codify Roe. District 7 Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R Fischbach declined to comment on Grahams bill, Fischbachs spokesperson said. In her statement after Roe was overturned, Fischbach said, Todays Supreme Court decision was a step to protect the most precious and basic right the right to lifethe American people will be able to decide the issue of abortion through their elected officials. This is what democracy looks like. Jill Abahsain, DFL Abahsain did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. Abahsain told the Star Tribune that abortion is a medical procedure and should not be up for public debate. District 8 Rep. Pete Stauber, R Stauber did not respond to the Reformers request for comment on Grahams bill. After Roe was overturned, Stauber said, This ruling is a win for the sanctity of life. Additionally, this decision also returns decision-making power back to elected officials in states as intended Jennifer Schultz, DFL Schultz opposes Grahams bill and reaffirmed her support for reproductive rights. A proposed national abortion ban on a right that we have had for the last 50 years is another attack by the Republicans to take away our freedom, Schultz said. Politicians should not be dictating our health care decisions.

Mark ReinsteinCorbis via Getty Images Why didnt Congress codify abortion rights? In the 49 years since the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade, lawmakers have attempted to both shore up abortion rights and to overturn the decision all while abortion transformed national politics. Washington Correspondent Published 2022-01-26 0940 940 January 26, 2022 am Share Twitter Facebook Your trusted source for contextualizing politics news. Sign up for our daily newsletter. When the U.S. Supreme Court in September left Texas restrictive six-week abortion ban in place, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly responded that the conservative majoritys dark-of-night decision was flagrantly unconstitutional and would be met with swift congressional action. It was. Three weeks later, the House passed by a 218-to-211 vote the Womens Health Protection Act, which would prohibit states from passing most abortion restrictions prior to fetal viability. It was opposed by all House Republicans, along with Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, the chambers last anti-abortion Democrat. The Senate has yet to act. Even if it did, the bill is unlikely to pass the evenly divided 100-seat chamber, where nearly all legislation needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster. So even as Republican state lawmakers introduce copycat bans based on the Texas law, and the Supreme Court weighs a case that could upend abortion rights, the chance of federal legislation making it to President Joe Bidens desk by November, when Democrats could lose control of the House, the Senate or both, is basically nonexistent. Forty-nine years have passed since the Supreme Courts 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade established the constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. There have been congressional attempts to pass a constitutional amendment overturning Roe, as well as efforts to codify the decision. All have failed. Along the way, abortion has transformed national politics and created a gulf between voters and party leaders to the extent that by 2019, as many as 3 in 10 Democrats and Republicans did not agree with their party on abortion, according to the Pew Research Center. Happening Now What we know about the Supreme Court draft opinion and what it could mean for abortion access Impacts of leaked Supreme Court draft decision could have a chilling effect on abortion access Calls from Democrats to codify Roe have intensified in recent months, with Roes 49th and potentially last anniversary last week, several intermediary decisions on the Texas law, and a separate case Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization before the Supreme Court concerning a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi. Last month during oral arguments in that case, a majority of justices indicated that they are willing, at minimum, to weaken the viability standard set by Roe at approximately 24 weeks pregnancy. A Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs is expected by summer, and it has the potential to cap a decades-long effort by conservative abortion opponents to gut the Roe ruling and leave the issue up to the states. How the two parties arrived at this pivotal moment for abortion access involves the emergence of a new wedge issue, a realignment of the political parties, and decisions they made along the way about when and how to push for abortion regulations and to what extent. And it all happened within the past 50 years. Cecile Richards, president of the reproductive health organization Planned Parenthood and its affiliated political arm from 2006 to 2018, bristles when she hears the word controversial used to describe abortion. Public opinion has shown a majority support for abortion access that has remained remarkably consistent, she said. A June 2021 survey of U.S. attitudes about abortion rights and Roe from public opinion polling firm Gallup, for example, showed that 58 percent of Americans opposed overturning the 1973 ruling and 32 percent favored it mirroring public opinion in 1989. I think some people have a hard time wrapping their head around two different ideas One is that people have their own personal feelings about abortion, their own experience with it, what they feel like they would do, what they would want their daughter to do, Richards told The 19th. The other is that they absolutely do not want the government to make these decisions. The only thing thats changed is the politics of the Republican Party and frankly, the Democratic Party, she added. In 1975, when abortion was a newly established constitutional right, 19 percent of Democrats told Gallup that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 51 percent said it should be legal in certain cases, and 26 percent said it should be illegal in all cases. Among Republicans, the numbers were strikingly similar 18 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 55 percent said it should be in some and 25 percent said it should be illegal in all. The same poll taken in 2021 showed more Democratic voters supporting abortion in all or most cases and more Republicans supporting it in none, with sizeable majorities in both parties 91 percent of Democrats 69 percent of Republicans continuing to support abortion access in at least some cases. But the parties in Congress are less nuanced. In the House, Texas Cuellar is considered the only reliably anti-abortion Democrat and, as of 2019, there are no Republicans who support abortion rights. In the Senate, Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania both self identify as pro-life, though they have at times supported forms of abortion access, and Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have both embraced some abortion rights. As political scientists Scott Ainsworth and Thad Hall write in the 2010 book Abortion Politics in Congress When it comes to abortion, the increasingly partisan nature of abortion politics represents a case of issue evolution driven by party elites and filtering down to the masses. Sign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily Submitting Alisa Von Hagel is a political science professor and coordinator of the gender studies program at the University of WisconsinSuperior who tracks the emergence of abortion policy, particularly at the state level. She said one key to understanding abortion politics in 2021 is knowing that just several decades ago it was not considered a political issue at all. Von Hagel recalled a student who told her about a conversation with their grandmother and several others from that generation about studying the politics of reproductive rights. These older ladies were just like Why in the world is this a political issue? We never talked about it like that in the past, Von Hagel remembers the student relaying. I can still picture her face, thinking How is this possible? It was a very, very purposeful realignment that happened, Von Hagel added. Heading into the 1970s, political affiliation was not an accurate predictor for whether an individual supported abortion rights for voters or elected officials. But over the next 20 years, a political party realignment around abortion would begin to take shape.

Kevin LarkinAFP via Getty Images The term pro-life was not even in the political lexicon in 1972, when Republican Richard Nixon adopted anti-abortion positions during his presidential reelection campaign in a successful bid to win over Catholic voters, who had traditionally backed Democratic presidents, including the two before Nixon. The Supreme Courts 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade energized the anti-abortion coalition of evangelical as well as Catholic voters that began to emerge during Nixons presidency and still exists in politics today. Privately, Nixon told top aides that while he feared the ruling could encourage sexual promiscuity, he believed abortions should be available in certain circumstances, such as for pregnancies resoluting from incest or interracial relationships. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies abortion, believes that the Senate probably had a bipartisan majority that supported abortion rights when Roe was decided, but advocates did not feel a pressing need to pass legislation. It seemed to be kind of like overkill, because at the time, the abortion rights movement trusted the courts to protect abortion rights for some time, Ziegler told The 19th. During the 1976 presidential campaign, both Republican Gerald Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter opposed abortion in some cases. That year Congress for the first time approved the Hyde Amendment, which bars using federal dollars for most abortions, including in the governments Medicaid health insurance program. More Democrats than Republicans voted for for it, handing abortion rights opponents their first post-Roe victory. But some of those Democrats did so because it seemed like abortion rights were settled law and the Supreme Court would step in when it was challenged, according to Ziegler. There were some Democrats and progressives who voted for the Hyde Amendment in part because they thought the Supreme Court would invalidate it it was part of an appropriations bill, so if you liked other stuff in the appropriations bill, that was fine, because the Supreme Court would take care of it, Ziegler said. It didnt. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment in 1980. Marchers protesting the Supreme Courts decision in Roe fill Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Capitol on January 22, 1981. Herbert K. WhiteAP It was around this time that abortion started to become linked to ideology and party in ways that had not occurred before, according to Ainsworth and Hall. Republican Ronald Reagan who had relaxed abortion restrictions as Californias governor called for the appointment of anti-abortion judges during his 1980 White House campaign. By the late 1980s, he had nominated more federal judges than any president before or since, and abortion rights groups began to realize we cant really rely on the courts anymore, we need to find a way through the political process to protect access to abortion, Ziegler said. When Democrat Bill Clinton campaigned for the White House in 1992, he did so with the message that abortion should be safe, legal and rare. At the time, that was the most forceful support for abortion rights from a post-Roe president, but it has since become outmoded in Democratic politics. When Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii repeated it during the 2020 presidential primary, abortion rights advocates said she was out of step with a movement that believed rare was a concession to their opponents. Once president, Clinton marked the 20th anniversary of the Roe decision by reversing abortion restrictions put in place by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. But legislation proved harder. Though Clinton began his presidency with Democrats in control of both the House and Senate and with a majority that backed abortion rights, according to Ziegler disagreements in his own party remained over how to handle the Hyde Amendment and other specifics. Abortion rights demonstrators at the March for Womens Lives rally in Washington, D.C., on April 5, 1992. In 1992, the Supreme Court had affirmed the right to an abortion in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which challenged restrictive Pennsylvania laws. But the ruling also said states had some leeway to add some limits to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. So Democrats revived the Freedom of Choice Act that eras attempt to codify Roe. When it failed in 1993, Democratic leaders turned their focus to health care legislation. When it starts to take too long, you see the Democratic Party essentially saying Well, were not going to worry about this, well get to this later, Ziegler said. According to Michele Swers, a government professor at Georgetown University, the most aggressive Democrats got on abortion rights during this time period was the FACE Act, a law that protected clinic entrances. The window for any broader effort closed when Democrats lost control of both chambers of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections. In 1994, the Republican Party ran on its newly released Contract with America. Though by that time the partys candidates and lawmakers were increasingly aligning with the anti-abortion movement, the contract focused on 60 percent issues that had broad support from the electorate like slashing welfare programs and a balanced budget amendment. Overturning Roe was not one of them, so it was silent on abortion. The contract fueled Republican victories in the House and Senate, putting them in control of both congressional chambers for the first time since the 1950s. In early 1995, the Christian Coalition, a group founded in 1987 by religious conservative and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson that became emblematic of the Christian right, released its own contract with the American family at a news conference alongside then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of the authors of the partys 1994 platform. That contract did not propose a constitutional amendment to ban abortion outright due to practical concerns, political analysts said at the time, but it did call for restrictions on late-term abortions. Even still, intraparty divides over abortion existed. Then-Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who was considering a Republican presidential bid based on curbing religious influence on the party, told ABCs Good Morning America that he would not support it because it opposes a womans right to choose. What followed was a period when increasingly socially conservative Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents became more tenacious in supporting incremental restrictions. Republicans attached abortion-related riders to appropriations bills and repeatedly introduced what would become known as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which the Republican-controlled Congress passed twice only to be vetoed by Clinton, then eventually signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush in 2003. More from The 19th Texas six-week abortion ban will stay in effect indefinitely after Supreme Court decision to allow legal delays Abortion rights groups tie their fight to voting rights Abortion rights advocates want to hear more from Joe Biden It was during debate over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which banned abortions by dilation and extraction in the second trimester of pregnancy, that public opinion about an absolute right to legal abortion began to shift, according to tracking polls and Zieglers research and reproductive rights advocates worried they were losing the messaging battle. Even the name of the law, which adopted a term not used in medicine to describe late-term abortions, was seen as a victory for abortion opponents. In the House, the final version of the legislation was backed by 218 Republicans and 63 Democrats in the Senate, 47 Republicans and 17 Democrats. Its constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. Richards said that when she got to Planned Parenthood in 2006, the Democratic Party was still recruiting congressional candidates who did not support abortion rights. The organization really worked hard to establish that it was a fundamental right, and that it was something that the Democratic Party needed to lead on. Abortion rights advocates found an ally in then-Sen. Barack Obama, who told Planned Parenthood early in his Democratic White House bid that the first thing Id do as president would be to codify Roe by signing the latest iteration of the Freedom of Choice Act. But four months into his presidency, Obama said it was not my highest legislative priority and suggested energy would be better spent reducing unintended pregnancies. But Democratic differences on abortion threatened to derail Obamas namesake health care law. With Republicans united in opposition, Democrats could not afford to lose a single senator, and Ben Nelson, an anti-abortion Democrat from Nebraska, was the final holdout. To win his support, party leaders included a version of an amendment that does not mandate Affordable Care Act plans cover abortion, which was originally offered by another anti-abortion Democratic representative, Bart Stupak of Michigan. To appease opponents, Obama also issued an executive order reiterating that federal money would not be used to pay for abortions. Meanwhile, abortion rights advocates tried to take solace in the fact ACA plans would cover contraception. Anti-abortion activist stage a die-in in front of the White House in on January 21, 2015. Nicholas KammAFP via Getty Images In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans picked up more than 60 House seats to retake control of that chamber and added seven in the Senate as part of the tea party wave. Republican efforts picked up to defund Planned Parenthood by denying the organization state and federal money throughout the rest of Obamas presidency, many of them spearheaded by then-Rep. Mike Pence. In 2015, Republican House Speaker John Boehner resigned in part due to repeated battles with the conservative Freedom Caucus over their desire to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood funding. In January 2016, Planned Parenthood, under Richards leadership, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clintons White House bid. It was the first time the organization had made an endorsement in a presidential primary, but as Richards told the New York Times Everything Planned Parenthood has believed in and fought for over the past 100 years is on the ballot. When Clinton accepted the endorsement and announced that she supported repealing the Hyde Amendment, the Guardian called it truly surprising and Salon said it was a game changer. Hyde Amendment repeal ended up in the Democratic Partys official policy platform a move polling showed was popular with the partys base but less so with the broader electorate. Clinton went on to lose the November 2016 election to Republican Donald Trump, who said he was running to be a pro-life president and had taken a number of anti-abortion stances during his campaign. He was the first sitting president to attend the annual March for Life rally and appointed three Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett who cemented the courts conservative anti-abortion majority. By the time the 2020 Democratic presidential primary got underway, the sizable field of contenders all supported some version of Roe codification and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, citing the Trump administrations attempts to curb abortion access and restrictive laws recently enacted in Georgia and Alabama. To run for president as a Democrat in 2020 meant unequivocally supporting abortion rights and for Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, it necessitated an evolution. After Biden joined the Senate in 1973, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to overturn the courts Roe ruling. In a Washingtonian magazine interview at the time, he said of Roe I think it went too far. I dont think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body. But times changed, and so did he. In a 2007 book, Biden said he had arrived at a middle-of-the-road position on abortion. In 2008, he described Roe as close to a consensus that can exist in a society as heterogeneous as ours. As Obamas vice president, Biden said the government had no right to tell other people that women, they cant control their own body. By the 2020 presidential primary, his abortion politics matched the partys base. Biden went on to drop the Hyde Amendment in his first budget proposal. Early in his presidency, he also rescinded the Mexico City Policy, known as the global gag rule, which requires foreign organizations to certify they will not promote abortion as a condition for receiving U.S. aid for reproductive health care. In October, his administration reversed a Trump-era regulation that barred health care providers receiving Title X family planning funds from mentioning abortion care to patients as an option. People attend this years March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington on January 21. Susan WalshAP Biden has emphasized codifying Roe as a proxy for his larger abortion messaging and has said he would sign the Womens Health Protection Act if it were to make it to his desk. But, with anti-abortion conservatives anticipating judicial victory, it is unclear what, if anything Bidens administration or Democrats in Congress can deliver legislatively. Since Democrats lack a legislative path to head off the Dobbs decision, they have turned to making the case that voters should reinforce their congressional majorities in the 2022 midterms, believing the partys support for abortion access will benefit their candidates up and down the ballot. We are in a total stalemate in Congress and it would take extraordinary leadership by this president and frankly, by the Democrats in the United States Senate, to do anything legislatively to codify Roe, Richards said. I dont think most people, unless they live in the state of Texas, know what is potentially coming, she added.

Events Jobs About Us Community Guidelines Membership Membership FAQ Ways to Give Sponsorship Privacy Instagram","The second half of this article outlines the political and legislative battles surrounding abortion rights and restrictions in the United States from the 1980s to the early 2020s. Key developments include:
	1.	Reagan Era: President Ronald Reagan, who initially had a moderate stance on abortion, shifted right during his 1980 campaign, emphasizing anti-abortion policies. He appointed a record number of federal judges who shared his views, signaling to abortion rights advocates that they could no longer rely solely on the courts and must pursue legislative solutions to safeguard abortion access.
	2.	Clinton Administration: When Democrat Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992, he supported making abortion “safe, legal, and rare,” the most progressive stance on abortion for a president up to that time. Once elected, he reversed Reagan-era abortion restrictions but faced intra-party divisions on how to legislate these protections, especially around the Hyde Amendment. His attempt to pass the Freedom of Choice Act to codify Roe failed due to these divisions.
	3.	1990s Shifts in Republican Strategy: The 1994 “Contract with America,” which led Republicans to significant victories, focused on unifying issues rather than polarizing ones like abortion. However, the Christian Coalition later pushed the GOP towards stricter abortion stances. Republican lawmakers increasingly supported incremental restrictions, such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which Clinton vetoed but was eventually signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003.
	4.	Obama’s Approach: Barack Obama, who initially promised to codify Roe, prioritized other issues once in office. Despite securing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), internal divisions over abortion, especially from pro-life Democrats, resulted in compromises like not requiring ACA plans to cover abortion. Obama later issued an executive order ensuring federal funds wouldn’t pay for abortions, further highlighting Democratic divisions on the issue.
	5.	Republican Gains During the Tea Party Era: The 2010 midterms saw Republicans regain the House, spurred by the Tea Party movement, leading to intensified efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. High-profile clashes included demands to shut down the government over abortion funding, which contributed to Speaker John Boehner’s resignation in 2015.
	6.	Clinton vs. Trump (2016): Planned Parenthood’s endorsement of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary marked its first primary endorsement. Clinton, running on a pro-choice platform, advocated for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, signaling a shift in Democratic attitudes. Conversely, Donald Trump’s campaign marked the GOP’s firm anti-abortion stance, which he underscored by appointing conservative judges to the Supreme Court.
	7.	Biden’s Shift: Joe Biden’s stance on abortion evolved over the decades, culminating in his 2020 campaign supporting codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment. As president, he dropped the Hyde Amendment from his budget and rolled back Trump-era restrictions on reproductive health care. However, with a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, his administration faces challenges in enacting federal abortion protections.
	8.	Democratic Strategy Ahead of 2022: Facing potential challenges from a Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Democrats have focused on the importance of state and midterm elections, urging voters to support pro-choice candidates to preserve abortion rights legislatively.

In sum, the article traces the decades-long, contentious interplay between U.S. political parties, judicial rulings, and public opinion on abortion, culminating in the present-day uncertainties surrounding federal protections for abortion rights."

Wade, while a dormant ban lay on the books By Anya van Wagtendonk and Shawn Johnson August 10, 2023 Download A young woman holds a sign demanding a womans right to abortion at a demonstration to protest the closing of a Madison abortion clinic in Madison, Wis., April 20, 1971.

The protest is held at the Dade County building. AP Photo In this Wisconsin Public Radio series, How We Got Here Abortion in Wisconsin since 1849, WPR reporters explore how the states 1849 abortion ban came to be and how Wisconsinites have lived with and without it since.Last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion was sent back to states immediately reviving Wisconsins pre-Civil War abortion ban. Few if any states reverted to laws as old as Wisconsins. Over the nearly 50 years the ban was unenforceable, why had lawmakers never revoked it? Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPRs email newsletter. Email PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. In some ways, the answer is simple There was never the political will. And in the years immediately following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the political lines when it came to abortion were blurred. It would take nearly a decade for the major parties in Wisconsin, and the nation, to begin to adopt unified stances on abortion.And even as those stances coalesced, Democrats never amassed the legislative majorities they would need in Wisconsin to revoke the ban. Joanne Duren of Cazenovia, speaks after an Assembly vote on the bill she authored to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions on March 8, 1978. The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images The first significant post-Roe abortion legislation in Wisconsin was a bipartisan bill to restrict the procedure.Rep. Joanne Duren of Cazenovia was a Democrat, a devout Catholic and a passionate abortion opponent. She shepherded the 1978 proposal, which would prevent people from using Medicaid to pay for abortions, through months of legislative wrangling.This will move the state from an economic policy of killing human life to a policy which favors child-bearing and childbirth, Duren told colleagues during one of the lengthy debates on the bill.Democrats held two-thirds supermajorities in both the Assembly and the Senate but they were deeply divided on this issue. Nevertheless, Duren was optimistic the proposal would pass. Religious organizations and church leaders supported the plan, calling and writing lawmakers and showing up to testify at hearings. A sizable majority of lawmakers, it appeared, was ready to listen.Abortion rights activists hoping to stop the bill descended on Madison, shouting at lawmakers in the Assembly and Senate. They were ejected from the chambers as some threw pipe cleaners shaped like coathangers from the galleries, a reference to a crude instrument sometimes used for dangerous, self-induced abortions. Youre killing women, a protester shouted, according to newspaper coverage of the time. Sen. Michele Radosevich was a freshman Democratic lawmaker when a bill to bar the use of Medicaid funds for abortion came before the Legislature. Radosevich said she was compelled to speak out against what she saw as a cruel bill. Her words landed her on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal on Feb. 17, 1978. Image courtesy Wisconsin State Journal Down on the floor, emotions among lawmakers also ran hot. One suggested government funded abortions would empower promiscuous women.The rhetoric rankled Michele Radosevich, then a freshman Democratic senator from North Hudson. She opposed the bill, which she described as cruel because it targeted poor women.Gentlemen, compassion, please, Radosevich said at the time. When you face your God, I wonder what you will tell him.The debate lasted days. There were lengthy hearings and dozens of amendments. The bill pinged back and forth between houses before it was finally approved by the Legislature on March 8, 1978. After all that, Gov. Martin Schreiber, also a Democrat, vetoed the bill the same night.I know for sure that a pregnant woman is a human being a person, he said when explaining his veto. I, in my own mind, do not know when a fetus becomes a human being a person.The infighting among Democrats did not end that night. They organized an attempt to override Schreibers veto. And they came within two votes of succeeding. Martin J. Schreiber was the Democratic governor of Wisconsin from 1977-79. In this speech from 1978, he says, I know for sure that a pregnant woman is a human being, a person. I, in my own mind, do not know when a fetus becomes a human being, a person. We are placing an unfair amount of weight imbalance to something which is unknown against that of a human being of which I can touch, of which I can relate to, of which I can have compassion for. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images Democrats would have restricted abortion further if it werent for pro-choice RepublicansAt this moment in time, the parties were split on abortion throughout the country, said Mary Ziegler, a leading expert on the history of abortion in the post-Roe v. Wade era.In the 70s, the parties didnt have clear identities yet entirely when it came to abortion, she said. The idea that the Republican Party was the party of life, as Ronald Reagan put it, or the anti-abortion party, and the Democrats were supportive of legal abortion wouldnt really coalesce until the early 80s.That divide played out in the 1978 debate on abortion. Rep. Sheehan Donoghue, a Republican, was instrumental in defeating the bill, not only voting to uphold Schreibers veto but also delivering an impassioned speech that at least one lawmaker credited with changing his mind.Ladies and gentlemen, Donoghue told her colleagues, What you do here today, you will have to live with the rest of your lives.Today, Donoghue is retired, living in northern Wisconsin. She still remembers the debate and her reasons for opposing the bill.This legislation, in my opinion, did damage to the equality of women in control over their own bodies, she said. She said she was particularly concerned the bill while it included exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother did not account for pregnancies that could harm the health of the mother. I found a real inconsistency there, she remembered. And I thought it was cruel towards women who happened to be on welfare, who had some problem, some physical problem, if the pregnancy would incapacitate them but not kill them.The veto override failed by two votes, meaning Donoghue and other Republicans who opposed the bill were critical to its defeat.But it wasnt a clear-cut victory for abortion rights lawmakers. Days after Schreibers veto, the Legislature passed a more limited bill that included protections for the health of a mother. Schreiber who said he was personally opposed to abortion signed it into law. An abortion rights protester holds coat hangers outside the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wis., to protest a bill to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions, on March 8, 1978. The bill passed and was quickly vetoed by Gov. Martin Schreiber. Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images As anti-abortion voters organize, the parties split The bipartisan coalitions that worked for and against the bill would be hard to imagine today, but Radosevich, the Democratic lawmaker who spoke so fervently on the floor, said they were common in the late 70s.It was a very different time in terms of party alignment, she said.Still, Radosevich, a freshman lawmaker from a competitive district, knew the power of the abortion issue with voters. She had originally planned to stay quiet during debate and acknowledge that some of her Democratic colleagues were just a little bit scared of the voters back home. Their silence, and the arguments from anti-abortion lawmakers, propelled her to speak up. That landed her on the front page of the Wisconsin State Journal. She said she thinks that public stance, and the ensuing attention, contributed to her losing her next election.But, you know, theres no way I could have voted for the bill and looked at myself in the mirror the next day, she said.On the other side of the abortion debate from Radosevich was Gary Goyke, then a Democratic state senator from Oshkosh. He voted in favor of the bill restricting Medicaid funds, telling WPR he viewed it, at the time, as the government removing itself from the abortion decision.But Goyke described it as a turning point for him, personally. He said he began to move more toward embracing abortion rights, including in his unsuccessful bid for Congress just a year later.That personal evolution wasnt without consequence. Goyke, a Catholic, remembers being confronted at church.A lady would come sit right in the front row. And at every service that I was at every Mass I was at she would stand up and say, Let us pray that Sen. Goyke learns to respect life, he remembered. And then the parish would say, Lord, hear our prayer. And I am sitting right in front.It was around this time when politically active anti-abortion voters were becoming a force in the Republican Party. But it didnt happen overnight. Abortion rights protesters gather outside the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wis., to protest a bill to bar people from using Medicaid to fund abortions, on March 8, 1978.

Image courtesy of the Wisconsin Historical Society and Wisconsin Historic Images When Barbara Lorman was first elected as a Republican state senator in 1980, she openly supported abortion access.I think Ive always been pro-choice, Lorman told WPR. And its probably also what led me to be a Republican.Lorman said she always viewed her position on abortion as consistent with traditional Republican values, like minimizing government control over peoples lives. At the time, she says none of her Senate colleagues objected.You know, almost anybody could fit in either party, frankly, Lorman said.But by 1994, it was a different story. After the 1990 Census, Republicans redrew her district, making it a lot more conservative a safe seat for the GOP.She drew a primary challenge from Scott Fitzgerald whom she describes as a darling of the right wing and says anti-abortion activists threw their weight behind him immediately.Those are very devoted, conscientious voters. And like overnight, yard signs went up and down the highway, she said. And I saw that and I thought, Uh oh, this is gonna be a problem.Fitzgerald won and went on to serve in the Senate for decades. Hed later become the Senates Majority Leader and now represents the area in Congress.The win was more than symbolic. In 1997, Fitzgerald was the lead sponsor of a law that banned partial birth abortion in Wisconsin, one of several incremental abortion restrictions championed by the anti-abortion movement in the decades since Roe. Former Wisconsin State Senator Barbara Lorman at her home in Middleton on Tuesday, Aug. 8, 2023. Angela MajorWPR Democrats undergo their own shift, but slowly Democrats were undergoing their own shift toward abortion rights politics. In the 1990 race for attorney general, for example, the Republican incumbent signed on to a legal brief that supported overturning Roe v. Wade. His Democratic challenger, Jim Doyle, used it to campaign against him.That was the number one issue, Doyle said. Thats how I got elected. So it really was always a very important issue to me.Doyle later became governor and in 2009, Democrats won majorities in the Senate and Assembly. The party once again had complete control over state government for the first time in decades.Among the Democrats swept into office was Kelda Roys, a Madison state representative who, at 29, was the youngest member of the Legislature. Roys won a Democratic primary for her seat, in part, by touting her work as a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice, an abortion rights group.I came in just full of energy and optimism, Roys said. Like, Lets do all the things.One of her most ambitious goals To overturn the dormant pre-Civil War abortion ban she knew was still on the books. Gov. Jim Doyle speaks to a joint session of the Wisconsin Legislature during his State of the State address Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2007, in Madison, Wis. Behind are Senate President Fred Risser, left, and Speak of the Assembly Mike Huebsch, right. Morry GashAP Photo There were two problems, as Roys remembers. She said some abortion rights Democrats took Roe v. Wade for granted as settled law. And while Democrats held a slim overall majority, when it came to the issue of abortion, they didnt really have one at all. A handful of Democrats were still staunchly anti-abortion.It seemed like something that was symbolic, she said of taking on the dormant law. And so there just wasnt necessarily the big appetite to do it. And we didnt have the votes in that particular session, because we had all these anti-choice folks in our caucus.Bob Ziegelbauer was one of the Legislatures remaining anti-abortion Democrats. Now the Manitowoc County Executive, he says his stance on the issue was clear to everyone in the Democratic caucus. He doesnt remember ever being approached about working to lift the abortion ban.They wouldnt even think of asking me that, because it was so clear, he said. It didnt come up, because they knew me and I knew them.The cordial relationship came to an end during a debate on the 2009 state budget. Ziegelbauer supported a Republican amendment to restrict abortion, infuriating Democratic leadership. In response, they stripped him of a committee chairmanship. Later, Ziegelbauer left the party.That was the only time I crossed that line. And that line is pretty bright, Ziegelbauer said. They dont want you doing that.The 2009 session of the Legislature was defined by a difficult state budget and debates on issues ranging from payday loans to global warming to raw milk. Discussions of Wisconsins pre-Civil War abortion ban never surfaced publicly.The ironic twist to Democrats new fight The Democratic majority of 2009 was short-lived. In 2010, a Republican wave election gave the GOP control of the Legislature and brought Scott Walker into the governors office. That Republican coalition was much more willing to use its power to effect abortion law. In just a few years, they passed laws ending state funding for Planned Parenthood, requiring patients seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound first and banning abortion after 20 weeks.Anti-abortion victories around the country culminated in 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. For the abortion rights Democratic Party, it was the worst case scenario something advocates like Roys had warned could happen.Strictly politically speaking, however, that moment had a galvanizing effect for Wisconsin Democrats. Last fall, Democratic Gov.Tony Evers, who was viewed as vulnerable in his bid for reelection, ran hard on the issue of abortion and won. Kimberly resident Melissa Johnson holds a sign in support of Wisconsin state supreme court candidate Judge Janet Protasiewicz during a rally Saturday, March 11, 2023, in Appleton, Wis. Angela MajorWPR This spring, Justice Janet Protasiewicz likewise placed abortion rights front and center in her campaign for state Supreme Court. That proved a winning strategy for her campaign, too. When Protasiewicz was sworn in earlier this month, liberals gained a majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years. That state Supreme Court could have the final say on any challenges to Wisconsins abortion laws. If a pending lawsuit succeeds, the abortion ban could be gone.Todays Democratic Party is pushing hard for this. The state party poured millions of dollars into Protasiewiczs campaign, and earlier this year, every single Democratic member of the Legislature supported a proposal to overturn the states abortion ban.If the ban is overturned, abortion would once again be legal in Wisconsin, but the laws that were passed in the years after Roe would also be restored.That means decades worth of abortion restrictions would again be the law of the land from the Medicaid restrictions passed in 1978, to the 20-week abortion ban signed by Walker in 2015.With the parties now firmly entrenched on this issue, the fight over abortion in post-Roe Wisconsin would go on.For more from How We Got Here Abortion in Wisconsin since 1849, visit wpr.org1849.

This ban, dating back to 1849, was dormant for decades, only to be revived following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Despite periodic efforts to address abortion rights, Wisconsin lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, failed to repeal the ban during the nearly 50 years that it was unenforceable. One key reason was the lack of political will, as abortion politics were highly divided in the years after Roe v. Wade (1973). In the 1970s, even as abortion rights activists fought against restrictive measures, like the bill limiting Medicaid funding for abortion, there was no unified stance on abortion within either party. While the bill was vetoed by Democratic Governor Martin Schreiber in 1978, abortion opponents, including some Republicans, played a crucial role in defeating it.

Throughout the late 20th century, both parties saw shifts in their positions on abortion. For example, some Republican legislators, like Barbara Lorman, initially supported abortion access, but by the 1990s, the anti-abortion movement had gained significant traction, especially after redistricting led to more conservative Republican candidates like Scott Fitzgerald taking office. Fitzgerald would later sponsor laws that restricted abortion further, such as banning partial-birth abortions in 1997.

On the Democratic side, the shift towards pro-abortion rights stances was gradual. In the 2009 legislative session, Kelda Roys, a Democratic representative, sought to repeal the dormant 1849 abortion ban, but her efforts were hampered by internal divisions within her party. The Democratic majority in Wisconsin was short-lived, as the 2010 Republican wave saw anti-abortion policies gaining ground.

The 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade triggered renewed efforts to challenge the state’s pre-Civil War abortion ban. In the years since, Wisconsin Democrats have rallied around the issue, with Governor Tony Evers and Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz campaigning strongly for abortion rights. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, now with a liberal majority, may soon have the final say on whether the 1849 ban is overturned, potentially restoring abortion legality while also enforcing restrictions that were passed in the intervening years.

Ultimately, the battle over abortion in Wisconsin remains unresolved, with both parties now firmly entrenched in their respective positions."

Zurawski and a dozen other women argue in a lawsuit that Texas doctors and hospitals denied them necessary care because the providers were afraid to run afoul of the states abortion ban. Eric GayThe Associated Press Read more Stateline coverage on how states are either protecting or curbing access to abortions. AUSTIN, Texas A lawsuit in Texas asserting that the states abortion ban imperils women by dissuading doctors from ending dangerous pregnancies could provide a template for similar challenges across the country. Texas is one of 14 states that banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The Texas ban includes an exception that allows physicians to end a pregnancy if it could result in the death of the woman or a substantial impairment of a major bodily function. But the plaintiffs in the case, more than a dozen Texas women, argue that doctors and hospitals denied them necessary care because the providers were afraid to run afoul of the law. Those who violate the ban could face up to 99 years in prison, a 100,000 fine and loss of their medical license. Even before the Texas case was filed in March, the same issues were surfacing in other abortion-ban states, generating national attention and intense interest among elected officials in Washington, D.C. Attorneys for the Texas plaintiffs predict that similar suits will be filed in other states. Nicolas Kabat, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, the New York-based advocacy group that filed the Texas suit, said the problem is widespread across states that ban abortion. Were being contacted by dozens of women telling us similar stories, Kabat told Stateline, saying were really only scratching the surface here. Positive polling, past successes dont guarantee victory for abortion rights at the ballot box Citing press accounts, the plaintiffs petition points to about two dozen women in 11 states outside Texas who have had experiences like those of the Texas women Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. Its an incredibly important lawsuit and it has implications not only in Texas but in other states that have denied people the right to safe abortion health care, said former Texas Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, a senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes who gained national attention a decade ago for her filibuster against a polarizing anti-abortion rights bill. Attorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights are asking Travis County District Judge Jessica Mangrum to grant a temporary injunction and craft a new exception to Texas abortion ban that gives physicians and hospitals more latitude to provide pregnancy care and perform abortions. But lawyers for the Texas attorney generals office, representing the state, depict the suit as a bald attempt to usurp state authority over abortion policy. Mangrum, elected as a Democrat, presided over two days of arguments and testimony in mid-July. She told lawyers at the end of the hearing that it will likely be several weeks before she returns a ruling. First State Law to Criminalize Abortion Trafficking May Inspire Others At last months hearing, the plaintiffs recounted their anguishing personal ordeals after they were refused abortions. Amanda Zurawski of Austin, the lead plaintiff, nearly died after she was refused an abortion after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy. Zurawski and her husband, Josh, had already picked the name for their unborn daughter Willow and were planning a baby shower when they received the devastating news that they would lose their first child before birth. Amanda, 36, was diagnosed with a weakening of cervical tissue and told that Willow would not survive. But doctors initially refused to perform an abortion, she said, because they could detect fetal cardiac activity. Several days later, she developed sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection, and spent three days in intensive care, struggling to survive. Zurawski told Stateline in a phone interview that hundreds of people have reached out to her via social media to share similar stories and offer support. After the hearing last month, Zurawski said, she heard from tons and tons and tons of people just an outpouring of support, people wanting to get involved, wanting to help. Other plaintiffs told similarly harrowing stories at the hearing. Taylor Edwards, also from Austin, said she learned when she was 17 weeks pregnant that her daughter had a fatal condition called encephalocele, a protrusion of the brain through an opening in the skull, and would die at or before birth. She had to leave Texas to get an abortion. Lauren Hall, who lives near Dallas, discovered that her unborn child had anencephaly, a serious birth defect that prevents the fetus from developing parts of the brain and skull. Halls obstetrician refused to perform an abortion and was afraid to refer her to an abortion provider in another state. Hall eventually got an abortion at a clinic near Seattle. Studies conducted by abortion rights university research groups suggest that abortion bans are dissuading doctors in many states from providing care they would otherwise provide. Its an incredibly important lawsuit and it has implications not only in Texas but in other states that have denied people the right to safe abortion health care. Former Texas Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis A total of 50 anonymous surveys from health care providers in states with abortion restrictions detailed cases of care that deviated from the usual standard due to new laws restricting abortion, according to a study jointly conducted by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin and Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. In several cases, patients experienced preventable complications because clinicians reported their hands were tied, making it impossible for them to provide treatment sooner, according to the study. But anti-abortion rights advocates, including some physicians, dispute the contention that Texas medical exception is too vague to give doctors the confidence to perform necessary procedures. The language of the exception, they say, clearly gives doctors the leeway to use their medical judgment and to intervene in an emergency. They say they have sympathy for the plaintiffs but support the states contention that it would be inappropriate for Mangrum or any other judge to rewrite the abortion ban exception, since that would usurp a legislative function. Theyre trying to have the judiciary write the law, which is not appropriate, said Dr. Ingrid Skop, a San Antonio OB-GYN who testified for the state at last months hearing. The current state law clearly allows a doctor to use his reasonable medical judgment to determine when to intervene in a medical emergency to protect a womans life. Theres not a problem with the way the law is worded, she said. The problem is that the doctors have become confused, and they become frightened. In many cases, they have not been given guidance by medical societies or by their hospitals, and they often have been slow in offering interventions. Joe Pojman, founder and executive director of the Texas Alliance for Life, one of the states leading anti-abortion rights groups, also defended the medical exception. The law is already clear, he said. Judges are supposed to interpret the law, not rewrite the law. Activists Aim for Supreme Court With Local Abortion Bans in Blue States The suit names the state of Texas, the Texas Medical Board and Board Executive Director Stephen Brint Carlton as defendants. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, is also a defendant, though he is currently suspended pending a state Senate trial on impeachment charges alleging bribery and other wrongdoing. Lawyers for the attorney generals office, who could not be reached for comment, are asking the court to dismiss the suit. In a rebuttal petition, they accuse the plaintiffs of staging splashy news conferences and media tours to get a favorable court ruling after failing to convince the Legislature to adopt their preferred version of the medical exception. A proposed court order by the plaintiffs asks the court to give physicians discretion to use good faith judgment in providing abortion care to someone with unsafe pregnancy complications or instances in which a fetus is unlikely to survive the pregnancy or live after birth. But attorneys for the state say the plaintiffs proposed exception would, by design, swallow the rule, permitting abortions for pregnant females with medical conditions ranging from a headache to feelings of depression. Amanda Zurawski said shes always supported abortion rights but that her personal experience molded her into an impassioned advocate of the right to an abortion. She and her husband, she said, never wanted to be the poster family for this cause, but now theyre in the fight wholeheartedly. Id rather be at home with my newborn right now. Thats the life that I was envisioning. I would rather be on maternity leave with my daughter, not having to fight this fight, she said. But, you know, I think its really been empowering for me. And its actually been quite healing to have a cause and a purpose to put behind our loss and our grief.

Texas, along with 13 other states, banned abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. While the law permits abortions to save a woman’s life or prevent major bodily harm, the plaintiffs claim that physicians are fearful of violating the law, which could lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

The plaintiffs, including Amanda Zurawski, who nearly died from sepsis after being denied an abortion when her water broke at 18 weeks, argue that hospitals and doctors are refusing essential care out of fear of legal repercussions. Their stories highlight cases where medical conditions, such as fatal birth defects, were not treated promptly, as doctors were hesitant to intervene due to the vagueness of the law’s medical exception. This lawsuit, which seeks to expand the exception and allow doctors more discretion, is seen as a potential model for similar cases in other states with abortion restrictions.

The case is not only significant for Texas but could also have wide-reaching implications for other states with similar abortion bans. Attorneys for the plaintiffs are asking for a temporary injunction to modify the law, while state attorneys argue that the law already provides adequate flexibility for medical judgment. The outcome of this lawsuit may shape future legal challenges to abortion bans nationwide, as it highlights the potential risks of limiting access to abortion care and the concerns raised by healthcare providers under these restrictions."

July 12 Photos 2 By GEOFF MULVIHILL and LINLEY SANDERS Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print The majority of U.S. adults, including those living in states with the strictest limits on abortion, want it to be legal at least through the initial stages of pregnancy, a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds.The poll was conducted in late June, one year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, undoing a nationwide right to abortion that had been in place for nearly 50 years. It comes as state lawmakers in Republican-led states have moved to drastically limit abortion access and as GOP presidential candidates wrestle with how to approach the issue. While the laws have changed over the past year, the poll found that opinions on abortion remain much as they were a year ago complex, with most people believing abortion should be allowed in some circumstances and not in others. Overall, about two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, but only about a quarter say it should always be legal and only about 1 in 10 say it should always be illegal. Related coverage Ohio voters enshrine abortion access in constitution in latest statewide win for reproductive rights One year later, the Supreme Courts abortion decision is both scorned and praised A year after fall of Roe, 25 million women live in states with abortion bans or tighter restrictions By 24 weeks of pregnancy, most Americans think their state should generally not allow abortions.Thats true for 34-year-old Jaleesha Thomas, of Chicago. Id rather the person abort the baby than harm the baby or throw the baby out or anything, she said in an interview. But she said that around 20 weeks into pregnancy, she thinks abortion should not usually be an option. When theyre fully developed and the mother doesnt have any illnesses or anything that would cause the baby or her to pass away, its like youre killing another human, she said. Thomas state allows abortion until the fetus would be viable, generally considered to be around 24 weeks, and has become a destination for people from neighboring Kentucky, Missouri, Wisconsin and other places with travel bans for abortions. The poll finds that 1 in 10 Americans say they know someone who has either been unable to get an abortion or who has had to travel to get one in the last year, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and that this is especially common among young people, people of color and those living in states where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. Nearly half the states now allow abortion until between 20 and 27 weeks but bar it later than that in most cases. Before the end of Roe, almost every state fell in that range. Now, abortion is banned with varying exceptions at all stages of pregnancy in 14 states, including much of the South.The poll found that 73 of all U.S. adults, including 58 of those in states with the strictest bans, believe abortion should be allowed at six weeks of pregnancy. Just one state currently has a ban in effect that kicks in around then. Thats Georgia, where abortion is banned once cardiac activity can be detected around six weeks and before women often know theyre pregnant. Ohio and South Carolina have similar bans that are not being enforced because of court action, and Florida has one that hasnt taken effect. Iowa lawmakers late Tuesday passed a bill that would add it to those ranks once it is signed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds later this week. About half of Americans say abortions should be permitted at the 15-week mark, though 55 of those living in the most restrictive states say abortion should be banned by that point. And by 24 weeks, about two-thirds of Americans, including those who live in states with the fewest restrictions, say it should be barred.While most GOP-controlled state governments have been pushing for more abortion restrictions, the poll finds that theres not always support for doing so. Nationally, about 4 in 10 people said it was too difficult to access abortion in their community, compared with about a quarter who think its too easy.

Wade decision. Theres a lot of reasons, he said. Not the least of which The people who dont want kids and go on and have them the kids usually suffer for it. People in states with the strictest bans were slightly more likely to say abortion was too difficult to access compared with those living in the least restrictive states. Overall, about half of Democrats say its too difficult, compared with 22 of Republicans.And women were more likely to say access was too challenging in their area. For both Republicans and Democrats, there was not much of a gender divide on the topic About half of both Democratic men and women found it too challenging, and around 2 in 10 GOP men and women did. But nearly half of independent women thought so, compared with about one-third of independent men.The poll of 1,220 adults was conducted June 22-26 using a sample drawn from NORCs probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Conducted in late June, the poll highlights that most Americans, one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, still believe abortion should be permitted in certain circumstances, though opinions vary by stage of pregnancy.

While about two-thirds of Americans generally support abortion rights, only around 25% believe abortion should always be legal, and just 10% say it should always be illegal. A majority agree that abortion should be allowed at least until six weeks of pregnancy, which is the current limit in Georgia. However, by the 15-week mark, half of Americans favor restrictions, with the majority in stricter states advocating for a ban at this stage. Most Americans oppose abortion after 24 weeks.

The poll also found that nearly half of Americans say it is difficult to access abortion services in their community, especially in states with stricter laws. Young people, people of color, and those living in abortion-restrictive states report more challenges in accessing the procedure. The data underscores the divide between public opinion and state-level restrictions, particularly in GOP-controlled states."

Wade was overturned, most adults still believe that abortion should be legal and most are in favor of Congress guaranteeing access to legal abortion. Topline Results Public Use Files Methodology July, 12, 2023 A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, most adults still believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and most are in favor of Congress passing a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion. This is similar to the results of an AP-NORC poll conducted July 2022 when Roe v. Wade was first overturned. Opinions are more divided over the timeframe of when abortion should be allowed. Seventy-three percent of respondents think that it should be allowed within the first 6 weeks, but that drops to 51 for 15 weeks. Most people living in states where abortion is highly restricted say it should be legal at least up to six weeks, even as they generally favor tighter access to abortion than adults overall. Most adults believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, consistent with a July 2022 poll. And 60 of the public think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. However, a partisan divide persists. Most Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while most Republicans think it should be illegal in most or all cases. Similarly, 84 of Democrats support a federal law ensuring access to the procedure, compared to just 32 of Republicans. Democrats are more supportive of legal abortion than Republicans regardless of religion. Among Catholics, 85 of Democrats believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared to 39 of Republicans. People living in states with the most restrictive abortion laws are less likely than those living in states where abortion is broadly available to say abortion should usually be legal, 53 vs 70. Still, even in those most restrictive states, only 14 say abortion should always be illegal. And while most people believe that their state should allow legal abortion 6 weeks into pregnancy, opinions are more divided later into pregnancy. About half of adults say states should allow legal abortions at 15 weeks, and just 27 say the same at 24 weeks into a pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of those living in states with the most restrictive abortion laws people say abortion should be allowed at six weeks along with more than 7 in 10 people in the rest of the country. At 15 weeks, 59 of those living in the least restrictive states say it should be legal compared with about 4 in 10 people in more restrictive states. Only 31 of people living in states where abortion is broadly available say the procedure should be legal at 24 weeks as well as about one in four residents of states with at least some restrictions. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans believe that a pregnant person should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion in certain circumstances, including if the child would be born with a life-threatening illness, the pregnant persons own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy, or the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. And majorities of born-again Christians and Catholics agree that a pregnant person should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion if the pregnant persons own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy or if the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. But if a person does not want to be pregnant for any reason, just 29 of Republicans believe they should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion compared to 79 Democrats. These opinions have remained relatively consistent since AP-NORC last asked these questions in July 2022. Most adults know someone who has had an abortion, including 63 of Democrats and 53 of Republicans. Despite the overturning of Roe v. Wade, few Americans know someone who has been unable to get an abortion 7 or who had to travel to another state to do so 7 in the last year. The public is divided about how easy it is to access abortion in their community. Thirty-nine percent think it is too difficult, 24 think it is too easy, and 32 think it is about right. About half of adults say access is about right when it comes to family planning services and birth control and prenatal care, while 28 say it is too difficult to access these services. People living in states with highly restrictive abortion policies are somewhat more likely to say its too difficult than people in states where abortion is broadly available, 44 to 36, even though people in these states generally favor more restrictions on abortion. Overall, 39 of adults approve of how President Biden is handling abortion policy, including 61 of Democrats and just 18 of Republicans. States where most abortions are illegal at all stages of pregnancy with few exceptions include Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Abortion is illegal after about six to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah. And states where abortion is legal at least until 22 weeks include Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. The nationwide poll was conducted June 22-26, 2023 using the AmeriSpeak Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago.

The Associated Press and NORC.","A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a majority of Americans continue to support legal abortion, although opinions vary on the specifics. According to an AP-NORC poll from June 2023, most adults believe abortion should remain legal in all or most cases, with 60% advocating for a federal law to guarantee abortion access nationwide. However, views on the timing of abortion are divided. While 73% think abortion should be legal within the first six weeks of pregnancy, that support drops to 51% at 15 weeks, and only 27% support it at 24 weeks.

Political party affiliation heavily influences views: most Democrats support broad access to abortion and a federal law to protect it, while Republicans tend to favor restrictions or complete bans. This divide also extends to religious groups, with Democrats more likely than Republicans, even among Catholics, to support legal abortion. People in states with more restrictive abortion laws are more likely to support limitations but still generally favor abortion at least up to six weeks.

Public opinion also reflects support for abortion in specific circumstances, such as when a pregnancy poses a risk to the person’s health or results from rape or incest. However, only 29% of Republicans support abortion for any reason, compared to 79% of Democrats. Despite the legal changes, the majority of Americans still know someone who has had an abortion, though fewer know someone who faced barriers to obtaining one.

While public views are mixed on how easy it is to access abortion, with 39% stating it is too difficult, there is significant concern over access to family planning and prenatal care, especially in states with restrictive policies. In terms of the current political climate, 39% of adults approve of President Biden’s handling of abortion policy, with notable partisan differences.

The poll highlights that while the country remains divided over abortion access, most Americans support some form of legal abortion, with significant regional, political, and personal circumstances influencing opinions."

Over the course of almost 15 years, the Starks, who are Jewish, adopted three children from the United States Natanya, David and Maya and then three from China Jessica, Ella and Celia. Adam Stark, who married his wife, Marisa, in 1998, said the couple just always knew that they would adopt. We wanted to create a big, special family, and its the best thing weve ever done. We have the means to give a child in need a family. I wouldnt have done it any different way. To benefit from having that child as part of your family, its created a very special dynamic for us, he said. My children wouldnt be here if their birth mother decided against life. Marisa Stark Natanya, their first child, was adopted from an agency the couple found in Kansas. After doing the routine paperwork and social worker home study, they were paired with the birth mother, a teenager who wasnt able to support her baby but who wanted the child to grow up with a good life and a good family, Adam said. Adam and Marisa flew to Kansas and met Natanya on the night she was born Jan. 21, 2002. Adam remembers the very first time he held his adopted daughter, and later taking her home to New York. She was very tiny, he recalls. She was the smallest baby ever on that plane. The Starks knew that they wanted their child to have siblings of her own to play with, and in 2004, with the help of another agency, they brought home twins from Texas David and Maya, who are now 15.

Photo courtesy of Marisa Stark In April 2007, their biological son, Zachary, was born, but for Marisa, four wasnt enough. She read articles about foster care and learned about abandoned children in orphanages in need of homes, especially in China. She saw a photo of Jessica, who was burned as a child and was only a couple of months younger than Natanya. The process of international adoption took about 13 frightening months, Marisa says. By the time the Starks completed the paperwork, Jessica was already seven years old when she came to live with the family in 2009. There was this little girl on the other side of the world stuck in an orphanage I was beside myself because of all the quarantines and delays, Marisa said. But we brought her home, and I remember Natanya ran up to Jessica screaming, Jessie, Ive been waiting for you my whole life! She was so happy to have a sister her own age. After Jessica, whom the parents describe as the easy, artistic one, the Starks wanted to continue to add to their family. A little over a year later, in 2010, Natanya and Marisa went back to China to pick up their fifth toddler, Ella, who was born with one eye. Then five years later, Celia came along after the Starks participated in a Chinese government-led temporary host family adoptee program. Under the program, Celia went to live with the Starks in late 2015 for four weeks. She had cerebral palsy and the biggest grin wed ever seen, Marisa said. We always called her Ms. Happy. Natanya Stark attended her first March For Life in Washington D.C. on Jan. 24. She says she was excited to see young people her age marching for the cause. Photo Allyson Escobar Marisa described Celia as the sweetest, happiest, most cheerful kid in the whole world Adam and I and the kids knew, we couldnt let her go. They went through the adoption process once more and brought Celia, then 9, home in late 2016. Now 12 years old, she is enrolled in a special education program. She has certain developmental challenges, but everyone knows and loves her, Adam says. Celia lights up a room. My kids are all so different, and its so nice to be a part of that, Marisa says. One day I can be in the theater with Maya, to watching debates with Zachary, or cheering David at cross-country meets. Or Jessica, who came into the States not speaking any English, and now shes a top student and into photography. My children wouldnt be here if their birth mother decided against life. All of them understand that, she said. Tags adoption, Catholic News, March for Life, New York, pro-life Login here to comment with a friend.

Natanya Stark, adopted at birth, attended the 2020 March for Life in Washington, D.C., to advocate for adoption, sharing her belief that it is the best choice for children born into difficult circumstances. The Stark family, from Pound Ridge, New York, has seven children, six of whom are adopted, including three from China. They are committed to spreading the message that adoption is a loving alternative to abortion and that no child is unwanted.

Adam and Marisa Stark, both of whom are Jewish, decided to build a large family through adoption early in their marriage. Their first child, Natanya, was adopted from Kansas in 2002, followed by twins David and Maya in 2004. The couple then had a biological son, Zachary, in 2007, and later adopted children from China: Jessica, Ella, and Celia, with Celia having special needs.

The Starks’ story demonstrates the positive impact of adoption, emphasizing how their children’s lives have been enriched by their adoption experiences. Marisa Stark also highlights how the family’s diverse experiences, such as Jessica’s success despite language barriers and Celia’s joy despite developmental challenges, prove that every child has a place in a family. The family’s story serves as a powerful testament to the value of life and the transformative power of adoption."

Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion, handing a victory to abortion-rights supporters who have seen access to the procedure eroded by Republican lawmakers in the deeply red state. The outcome of the election that concluded Tuesday highlighted what appeared to be a gap between voter sentiment and the expectations of Kentuckys GOP-dominated legislature, which imposed a near-total ban on abortions and put the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. While a significant moral victory for abortion-rights advocates, the amendments defeat will have no practical impact on the right to an abortion if a sweeping ban on the procedure approved by lawmakers survives a legal challenge presently before the state Supreme Court. Still, the amendments rejection leaves open the possibility that abortion could be declared a state right by the court. Rachel Sweet of Protect Kentucky Access, an abortion-rights coalition, hailed the outcome as a historic win against government overreach into the personal medical decisions of Kentuckians. The people of Kentucky have spoken and their answer is no - no to extremist politicians banning abortion and making private medical decisions on their behalf, said Amber Duke, interim executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky.

Abortion-rights supporters who suffered years of setbacks in Kentuckys legislature were jubilant, but said considerably more work is ahead in their quest to restore access to the procedure. The Family Foundation, a faith-based organization opposed to abortion, said Wednesday that the fight for the unborn will continue. While we are disappointed in the results of Amendment 2, the pro-life movement in Kentucky and across the nation, is steadfast in its resolve to continue defending life, David Walls, the groups executive director, said in a written statement. Kentuckys laws protecting preborn children remain in place and Kentuckians have returned large, pro-life legislative majorities to the General Assembly. The Kentucky ballot question had asked voters if they wanted to amend the constitution to say To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion. A year ago, lawmakers had added the proposed amendment to the 2022 general election slate in a move some thought would drive more conservative voters to the polls at a time before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June overturning Roe v. Wade. Since then, voters in Kansas have rejected a ballot measure that would have changed that states constitution to let lawmakers tighten restrictions or ban abortions. Kentucky was among a handful of states with abortion referendums on the ballot this fall. The Kentucky Supreme Court has a hearing next week on challenges by the states two remaining abortion clinics to the near-total abortion ban approved by lawmakers. The high court ruled this summer that the ban would stay in place while it reviewed the challenges. Abortion-related court battles have been frequent and fierce in Kentucky since Republicans took full control of the legislature after the 2016 election. Lawmakers enacted a series of laws adding restrictions and requirements for those seeking to end their pregnancies. Fervor ran high on both sides during the campaign, as donations poured in, politicians spoke out, volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and advocates accused the opposition of misleading voters. The legislature previously enacted a so-called trigger law banning nearly all abortions if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The only instances when abortions are currently allowed in Kentucky are to save a pregnant womans life or to prevent disabling injury. There are no exceptions for rape or incest victims. Pointing to the extremely narrow exceptions, abortion-rights supporters said the legislatures hardline stand on abortion made constitutional protections necessary. Abortion opponents, in pushing for the amendment, said it would have ensured abortion policy comes from the legislature where they say it belongs and not from the courts.

The outcome reflects a divide between Kentucky’s voters and its Republican-dominated legislature, which has enacted restrictive abortion laws in recent years. The amendment’s defeat was celebrated by abortion-rights groups like Protect Kentucky Access and the ACLU, who framed it as a rejection of government interference in personal medical decisions. On the other hand, pro-life organizations like the Family Foundation expressed disappointment but reiterated their commitment to defending anti-abortion policies.

The proposed amendment was part of a broader trend of state-level referendums on abortion, following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. While abortion access in Kentucky remains severely restricted—only permitted to save the life of the mother or prevent disabling injury, with no exceptions for rape or incest—the voters’ decision leaves open the possibility for future legal protections for abortion. The Kentucky Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on the state’s abortion ban could further shape the future of abortion rights in the state."

Kleinfelds lawyers had determined that the mandate included medication abortions, which are administered by pillthe kind that Kleinfeld offered at her clinic.Kleinfeld went to each of her patients, one by one, that morning and explained that she would have to cancel their appointments. They were distraught, upset, angry, saddened, confused, panic stricken, Kleinfeld remembers. Every single woman was planning to proceed with her decision in whatever way was necessary, she adds. Now, just at greater risk and compounding the health crises with more health risks.But if the decision was personally disruptive for Kleinfelds patients, Texass sweeping order was also an early sign of a soon-to-be explosive battle against abortion providers nationwide. On April 7, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas ban on abortions could stand, potentially triggering a petition to the Supreme Court.Planned Parenthood, which along with the Center for Reproductive Rights and other lawyers had sued Texas on behalf of a group of abortion providers, said earlier in the day on April 7 that if the Fifth Circuit did not rule, they planned to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Alexis McGill Johnson, the groups acting president, said on Twitter after the Fifth Circuit ruling Tuesday afternoon, that they would push forward.We wont let this injustice stand. Our patients deserve better, McGill Johnson wrote.The fight in Texas is just one of many battles nationwide. Five other Republican-led statesOhio, Texas, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahomahave taken similar steps to temporarily ban abortions during the coronavirus outbreak. While all of those have been challenged in court, more conservative states are considering following suit.Reproductive rights advocates are used to fighting state laws and court battles to preserve abortion access. But this is different. By using executive orders and other emergency measures, a handful of governors and state attorneys general have managed, at least temporarily, to all but shut down legal abortions. Abortion providers say these new restrictions will likely have lasting impacts, not only on the patients in search of abortions, but also on independent abortion clinics ability to survive financially in the months ahead.The challenges that independent clinics and their patients have had to contend with have not disappeared. Medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion raised enormous barriers before the pandemic and those barriers are becoming increasingly insurmountable now, said Jay Thibodeau, communications director for the Abortion Care Network, a national group for independent abortion providers.Independent clinics provide the majority of abortions in the United States. They often have small staffs, run on tight budgets and are constantly navigating new restrictions on the way they can provide services to their patients. While the increasing number of abortion regulations in recent years has led many clinics around the country to close, every state has maintained at least one abortion provider. Now the COVID-19 pandemic is testing that reality.Its going to strain any nonprofit small business who works near the margins, Dr. Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director at the Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa City, says of states banning abortions during the pandemic. Some of these clinics have found emergency relief. Abortion providers, represented by lawyers and reproductive rights groups, have sued and won temporary injunctions in Ohio, Alabama and Oklahoma, and come to an agreement with Iowa. Theyve argued that abortion is time-sensitive, essential health care, a position supported by seven national medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But nearly all abortions remain banned in Texas, and officials in Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia have questioned whether abortions should be allowed to continue in those states as well. Eighteen other states have also joined briefs supporting Texas in its fight.Hundreds of laws placing restrictions on abortion access have been passed over the last decade, and 2019 saw a particularly large wave of legislation seeking to curtail abortions across the country. These laws have an overwhelming chilling effect. Even in cases where reproductive rights advocates ultimately win in court, providers or patients feel the consequences. For example, in 2016, the Supreme Court sided with abortion providers in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, striking down regulations in Texas HB 2 law, which required all abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and clinics to be equipped with hospital-level surgical centers. But the court ruling came too late for many providers. We certainly saw after HB 2, when half the clinics closed, we went from 42 clinics to 21 virtually overnight, says Dr. Robin Wallace, co-medical director at Southwestern Womens Surgery Center in Dallas. And then with the favorable Supreme Court ruling in 2016, only a handful of clinics reopened. We did not see a rebound in terms of access. In addition to finding an abortion provider, patients must now worry about whether they are going to spread, or contract, COVID-19, Wallace notes. They are not only being turned away from the health care that they would normally be able to access in their home state, she says, but now theyre having to grapple with this decision of, do I violate this stay at home guideline in order to seek my abortion?In Texas, patients have had to travel particularly far from home. Nearly half of the states 254 counties were 100 miles from the nearest U.S. abortion provider before the COVID-19 order, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas at Austin. With all Texas clinics now blocked from offering abortion, 94 of the states counties are more than 100 miles from a provider, and nearly three quarters are more than 200 miles away.And the situation isnt great for abortion providers going forward, Wallace adds. While Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and other abortion providers continue to pursue legal action, the current ruling has allowed Abbotts order stopping abortions, which currently lasts through April 21, to stand. That amount of time not being able to provide care absolutely could be financially devastating and result in more clinic closures across the state, Wallace says.In Oklahoma, the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma city was facing similar conditions until April 6 when a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the states abortion ban. In the first week that Oklahomas order stopped abortions, Trust Women had to cancel about 160 appointments, according to Julie Burkhart, its CEO and founder. Most of her staff was already working remotely, and she had started to think about what would happen if the clinic had to stay closed for longer. That would absolutely impact us financially, Burkart said in an interview on March 31. Within the month I would really have to sit down and make some tough decisions.The courts decision on April 6 will let Trust Women to start providing some abortions again, but not all procedures are allowed and the picture could change. Its a huge relief that we can start seeing patients again, at least for now, Burkhart said on April 6. We hope the court will keep the ban blocked so our patients arent forced to travel to other states to find abortion care at a time when travel is risky and discouraged.COVID-19 has brought up other concerns for abortion providers, too. In Iowa, where Hardy-Fairbanks says shes grateful that her states agreement now allows her to make case-by-case determinations and provide abortions in compliance with the governors order, the clinic has had to cut back in other ways.The coronavirus in general has had a big impact, she says. Were a healthcare clinic. We do trans care and contraception care and well visits, and all of those kinds of visits we definitely cant do right now because they need to be delayed in order to allow people to stay home and to conserve our resources. Those restrictions create complications for patients who need that care, but providers say they were making those tough choices and taking COVID-19 precautions on their own before states stepped in. As family planning specialists, we were already acutely aware that an appropriate public health response was going to include some limitations on how other health care services continued during the crisis, Wallace says.Weeks before the Texas order to stop providing abortions, Wallace says her clinic was in touch with local health officials and had started screening patients for COVID-19 symptoms, practicing social distancing and limiting the number of people in the clinic. All the abortion providers who spoke with TIME said they had previously added these elements, as well as other measures including staggering appointment times, increasing cleaning and cutting back on other services.As abortion providers face destabilizing conditions, its unclear whether they will be able to access government relief funding the way other medical providers and nonprofits will be able to do. The CARES Act stimulus package gives President Trumps Small Business Administration the leeway to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, and the final law also includes Hyde Amendment-like language, which experts say prevents state and local governments from using COVID-19 funds to help abortion services. Several providers told TIME that they were unsure if they would be able to keep their staffs paid and protected during this time. Ive been working in Texas for seven and a half years now and have weathered the storms of HB 2 and other threats to access over time. And this by far is the most painful, Wallace says. When you layer this restriction of necessary health care on top of the publics concerns about the unknown of their future well being, it is just really beyond tragic. It was devastating.More Must-Reads From TIMEWhy We're Spending So Much Money NowThe Fight to Free Evan GershkovichMeet the 2024 Women of the YearJohn Kerry's Next MoveThe Quiet Work Trees Do for the PlanetBreaker Sunny Choi Is Heading to ParisColumn The Internet Made Romantic Betrayal Even More DevastatingWant Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?

Credit CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS The steps of the Supreme Court are a popular place to be when abortion rights are at stake. On Wednesday morning, actresses Elizabeth Banks and Busy Philipps showed up there to headline a rally attended by abortion rights activists. They were joined by liberal Congresswomen, including Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Barbara Lee of California. Abortion rights opponents gathered on the steps in protest as well. Inside the court, the justices heard oral arguments in June Medical Services v. Russo, a case that will determine the fate of abortion access in Louisiana and has the potential to undermine abortion rights across the United States. Banks, who most recently directed the Charlie's Angels reboot, and Philipps, formerly the host of Busy Tonight, are members of the Center for Reproductive Rights Creative Council, an initiative meant to harness Hollywood's influence to advocate for sexual reproductive health and rights. Lawyers from the Center for Reproductive Rights, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization, presented arguments to the Supreme Court, asking the nine justices to strike down a law in Louisiana that would ostensibly shutter all but one abortion clinic and leave an estimated 10,000 women who seek abortion annually in the state with access to a single doctor. In 2016, the Supreme Court found the same law, when implemented in Texas, unconstitutional. ""Today we are taking the opportunity to present reproductive freedom, including abortion, for exactly what it is no less than liberty itself,"" Banks said. SEE ALSO Inside the abortion clinic where no one whispers, no one shames For Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO and founder of the abortion provider Whole Woman's Health, the case feels like a ""time warp."" Nearly four years ago, Hagstrom Miller challenged Texas' law and descended triumphantly down the Supreme Court steps when the justices struck it down in a 5-3 ruling for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The victory created a new standard for states hoping to pass abortion restrictions Legislators had to demonstrate with clear, fact-based evidence that regulations protect women's health and do not pose an undue burden on patients. Previously, lawmakers could merely assert they were acting on behalf of women's health and safety without providing compelling evidence to back that up. The decision was the first in decades to fundamentally strengthen abortion rights.""Some days I feel like, wait we already did this, we already proved this, and the court ruled in our favor,"" says Hagstrom Miller. ""But look, theyve been trying to unravel Roe v. Wade for pretty much my whole life time. I cant be surprised."" Tweet may have been deleted At issue then and now is whether it's constitutional for states to require physicians who work at abortion clinics to obtain hospital admitting privileges. Advocates of the law say the regulation safeguards a woman's health in the event that she needs to be admitted to the hospital following an abortion procedure. Opponents argue that abortion-related hospital admissions are exceedingly rare and that the process for getting privileges is often unpredictable and onerous. Hospitals don't need to respond to every request and may not explain why they've rejected applications. They might dismiss an application because they don't want to be affiliated with an abortion provider, or because they know abortion-related admissions are rare and therefore a physician won't be a reliable source of income. Some clinics in Texas that were subject to admitting-privileges regulations prior to the Supreme Court decision closed because they could not comply with the law. The Center for Reproductive Rights expects the same to happen in Louisiana if Act 620 goes into effect. The law will effectively shutter two of the three abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving one physician who already has admitting privileges to provide abortion care to thousands of women who seek them in the state each year, creating a clear undue burden on patients. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry says the restriction would not close clinics. The law, which passed in 2014, reached the Supreme Court because the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a district court finding that the law was unconstitutional. Landry has argued that the legislation is significantly different than Texas' bill because, among other things, it didn't impose criminal penalties on providers. The Supreme Court will now potentially uphold its previous decision, or narrow its finding, which would weaken Whole Woman's Health. Reversing or watering down that decision would undermine abortion rights by opening the floodgates for new legislation designed to restrict abortion access under the guise of ensuring women's health and safety. Should the majority choose to overturn the decision, it will erase the victory advocates claimed in 2016. ""Some of those justices would like for Whole Woman's Health to not have happened in the first place,"" says Hagstrom Miller. ""Now that it is precedent, how will they apply it? Will they narrow the scope in some way? Those are the things I dwell on and think are likely."" In addition to taking up admitting privileges again, the Supreme Court will also consider whether abortion providers can challenge state restrictions as a third party. June Medical Services is the corporate name of Hope Clinic, a provider in Shreveport, Louisiana, that sued the state to stop the implementation of Act 620. While legal rulings over the past 50 years have held that providers can sue on behalf of their patients' constitutional rights, lawyers representing the state of Louisiana have argued that providers don't share a close relationship with their patients and that their interests compete with those of their patients. ""It's bullying for really powerful people to say, 'You can't have your rights unless you stand up and speak in front of us.'"" If the Supreme Court agrees, it could prevent providers from making legal challenges and effectively force patients to file their own lawsuits. An amici brief filed by Whole Woman's Health lays out a compelling case for why patients wouldn't or couldn't pursue a complex and expensive legal strategy, including the ""profound stigma"" of seeking an abortion and the ""personal struggles"" many women endure during that time. ""If providers such as Amici are no longer permitted to enforce the constitutional rights of their patients, those patients voices will likely go unheard and their rights un-vindicated,"" the brief argues. Hagstrom Miller describes asking a pregnant person to bring a lawsuit on behalf of themselves as ""ridiculous"" and ""cruel."" Doing so, she says, would require significant personal and financial resources, surrendering confidentiality, and subjecting oneself to public scrutiny and shame. ""We've endured all of these things as an organization and we barely made it through,"" says Hagstrom Miller. ""It's bullying for really powerful people to say, 'You can't have your rights unless you stand up and speak in front of us.'"" Following the oral arguments in June Medical Services, the justices will spend the next few months formulating and writing its decision. Its ruling is expected to come this summer.

Russo, a case challenging Louisiana’s abortion laws. These laws could close most of the state’s abortion clinics, leaving only one physician to serve thousands of women. The rally, joined by other activists and lawmakers, focused on preventing the law, which mirrors a Texas law previously ruled unconstitutional by the Court in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016).

Banks and Philipps, who are part of the Center for Reproductive Rights Creative Council, emphasize the importance of reproductive freedom as a fundamental liberty. The case revolves around a law that requires abortion providers in Louisiana to have hospital admitting privileges, which critics argue is an unnecessary and burdensome requirement that could force many clinics to close. This law, if upheld, would likely create a severe barrier to abortion access, particularly in a state with limited healthcare options for women.

The legal issue at hand is whether requiring admitting privileges for physicians is unconstitutional, as it places an undue burden on women’s access to abortion. Advocates point out that such regulations do not actually improve patient health, as abortion-related hospital admissions are rare. The outcome of this case could have national implications, potentially weakening or overturning previous Supreme Court rulings that protect abortion rights, including the 2016 ruling that strengthened the need for evidence-based regulations rather than just assertions about health safety.

Additionally, the case also explores whether abortion providers can challenge state laws on behalf of their patients, a decision that could significantly limit legal recourse for patients and providers alike. The outcome of this case, expected in the summer of 2020, will have profound consequences for abortion access in Louisiana and across the country."

He also recalls what happened next.The first thing that came to my mind was the Supreme Court, McConnell said in an interview this past week, remembering his reaction that night as he watched results from a basement office at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He soon called Donald McGahn, campaign counsel to the president-elect, who was slated to become the top White House lawyer.Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.ArrowRightA week later, Leonard Leo, the head of the conservative Federalist Society and a McConnell ally, was sitting with the president-elect and his advisers in Trump Tower in New York with a list of six potential conservative nominees alphabetically typed onto a piece of personalized stationery, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions.AdvertisementAs incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trumps daughter, Ivanka, came in and out of the room, Leo laid out a road map for Trump on the federal court system, potentially transforming the foundational understanding of rights in America.It was a moment antiabortion activists had been working toward for decades The highest reaches of Republican power finally focused, in unison, on achieving the once implausible goal of revisiting the jurisprudence of the 1960s and 1970s, including Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.The leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion on abortion this past week showed that a majority of the court is now poised to do just that, with three of the five potential votes for overturning Roe coming from justices recommended by Leo, appointed by Trump and confirmed under the leadership of McConnell.AdvertisementFor the activists who have fought against enormous odds to elevate the issues of abortion and judicial selection, the sudden turnabout is nearly as shocking as Trumps election was for McConnell. Interviews with more than two dozen movement leaders, Republican officials and operatives describe a half-century journey that began to settle only over the last decade, as the politics of abortion finally polarized itself as a partisan issue and emerged as a top-tier Republican priority.An annotated Supreme Court draft opinion overturning Roe v. WadeI think even until earlier this week most pro-life leaders were holding their breath, said Charles Donovan, a former Reagan White House aide, who began working as legislative director for National Right to Life in the late 1970s. I do think its pretty stunning.Abortion rights advocates have also been stunned by the transformation, accusing Republicans of hijacking the courts for partisan and unpopular ends.AdvertisementThis is exactly what we feared was coming, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Womans Health, a network of abortion clinics. Republicans just do this and all the gloves are off.With almost no change in national public opinion over the past five decades, and as a majority of Americans remain opposed to overturning Roe, the movement succeeded by mobilizing a determined minority of Americans and adopting the protest tactics and sometimes the language of the left. They transformed religious interpretations of prenatal life, embraced medical advancements that gave new understanding of the fetus and helped to build an academic legal movement in the Ivy League universities that railed against the evolution of American jurisprudence.Most importantly, they nurtured a generation of political and legal leaders who saw in the setbacks of the 1970s to 1990s a defining cause. As a young man in the 1970s, McConnell, 80, had worked with the late Justice Antonin Scalia, an avowed opponent of Roe, in the Justice Department. A photograph of the two men from that time still hangs in McConnells office.AdvertisementIf I was looking at ways to have an impact on the country that I thought would be good and positive, this would be the way to do it, McConnell said in the interview this past week at his office on Capitol Hill.Majorities change. Taxes go up. Taxes go down, he continued. If you prefer America right of center, which I do, and youre looking around at what you can do to have the longest possible impact on the kind of America you want, it seems to me you look at the courts.The BeginningsReturn to menuAt the time Roe was handed down in 1973, political leaders had no such conception of the judiciary. Both parties viewed the law as a practice mostly astride of politics. Abortion was an issue without clear political or religious boundaries beyond the Catholic Church.The former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, W.A. Criswell, who ran the First Baptist Church in Dallas, had argued that a child became an individual only after birth when it had a life separate from its mother. In both 1971 and 1974, Southern Baptists passed resolutions asking evangelicals to work for legal abortion in cases of rape, incest and fetal deformity, as well as cases where there was carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental and physical health of the mother.That permissiveness among pastors was about to run headlong into a cultural rebellion against the liberal social movements of the 1960s. Womens libbers are promoting free sex instead of the slavery of marriage, the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly wrote in a 1972 essay opposing the Equal Rights Amendment. They are promoting abortions instead of families.A topic once only whispered about was now openly debated. People in the pews were hearing arguments for abortion explicitly for the first time and rejecting those arguments, said Russell Moore, the former head of the Southern Baptist Conventions public policy arm. They did understand that when they were pregnant and when they were expecting their child, it was their child.AdvertisementRepublican election strategists had simultaneously identified the issue as a cleave to peel away Democratic Catholics and Southern Whites unsettled by social change. During the 1972 election, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott R-Pa. seized upon the new culture war message, denouncing Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern as the Triple-A Candidate Acid, Abortion and Amnesty.So began a three-decade transformation inside the Republican Party, marked by small victories and massive disappointments for the antiabortion cause. At the 1976 Republican convention, the party endorsed a constitutional amendment that would restore protection of the right to life for unborn children. More than two dozen female convention delegates signed a minority report urging the party not to take an abortion position.By 1980, the Republican Party had become more explicit, promising in its platform to promote judges at all levels that would respect the sanctity of human life. But the party, and even some advisers to the nominee, former California governor Ronald Reagan, were still deeply divided.AdvertisementDonovan remembers being approached at the convention by Marty Anderson, a senior policy adviser to the Reagan campaign who dismissively told antiabortion activists in the hallway to be happy with what you got.Some people on Reagans team were not pro-life and there were many of them that were unhappy, Donovan remembered.Those divisions would surface a year later with the naming of Reagans first Supreme Court nominee, Sandra Day OConnor. Her friend, Carolyn Gerster, who founded the Arizona Right to Life Committee, testified before the Senate that OConnor had repeatedly voted in the state Senate to protect abortion.We are concerned, John C. Willke, the head of National Right to Life, said that same day.OConnors confirmation set a template that would haunt the antiabortion movement for decades. She was followed onto the court by Reagan appointee Anthony M. Kennedy and George H.W. Bush appointee David Souter. Both joined OConnor in 1992 in endorsing the essential holding of Roe as part of the Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision.AdvertisementOn the legislative front, the antiabortion forces had still not found a way to power. In June 1983, a Senate vote on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion failed. Fifteen Democrats voted for the amendment, and 19 Republicans voted against it.Just two weeks prior, the Supreme Court had reaffirmed the right to an abortion, striking down a local ordinance imposing restrictive regulations on abortion providers.In the wake of defeat, Americans United for Life, an antiabortion law firm and advocacy group, convened a strategic national conference in March 1984 at the Palmer House Hilton Hotel in Chicago. The idea behind the event, titled Reversing Roe v. Wade Through the Courts, was to devise a coordinated legal strategy.It was a hopeful atmosphere, said Edward Grant, a past president and executive director of Americans United for Life and an attorney.AdvertisementAnother setback came in 1987, when Reagans nomination of Robert Bork, who publicly criticized the legal rationale that undergirded Roe, was defeated in the Senate, forcing yet another deep internal reckoning and retrenchment.Initially, it was people going, Oh my God, what just hit us? said Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network. It took a long time for people on the right to figure out what the best response was.New StrategiesReturn to menuThe organized response had, in fact, already begun, spearheaded by a group of law students at Yale, Harvard and the University of Chicago, who began meeting under the auspices of the Federalist Society in 1982. They were united by the idea that American law had strayed too far from the original intent of the nations founders.The group grew in the late 1980s, with chapters and members proliferating across the United States. It soon became an influential group in Washington with a sprawling budget and deep access across Republican levers of government.Abortion was not the motivating factor, said Edwin Meese III, a former Reagan adviser who has for decades led the fight for conservative legal reforms, in an interview last December. It was a matter of being honest and faithful to what the Constitution actually said.These self-described originalists came to reject Roe as judicial activism, and found common cause with abortion opponents who could mobilize voters. At the same time, antiabortion activists stepped back to reconsider their approach. They decided after the Casey decision that the anti-feminist rhetoric of Schlafly and the Equal Rights Amendment struggles from the 1970s had become counterproductive.Share this articleShareWe had to convince the public that we were compassionate to women, Willke would later write about the new strategy. Accordingly, we test marketed variations on this theme.The result was a new slogan Love Them Both, mother and child and a sharp rejection of some of the more aggressive methods of protest in the 1980s such as Operation Rescue, which had harassed women outside abortion clinics.What it is like to have a baby in states most likely to ban abortionsAmericans have usually been pretty unhappy about the idea of punishing patients, said visiting Harvard law professor Mary Ziegler, who has written extensively on the history of the movement.After the Year of the Woman swept four new female Democratic senators and Bill Clinton into office in 1992, abortion opponents founded the Susan B. Anthony List, named for the 19th century suffragist, aimed at electing more pro-life women to office.But as the movement made progress rebranding itself with the public, it found its foothold in the Republican Party remained tenuous. The 1996 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, asked to modify his partys plank to include a declaration of tolerance for those who did not oppose abortion.This is not compromise, it is civility, Dole said. A rebellion ensued, only to be settled by Dole making clear that he had not read the antiabortion platform on which his candidacy was based.The tensions within the party would only grow in the coming years as the evangelical right, which had by now fully unified against abortion, increasingly made threats against the Republican Party.Paul Weyrich, the founder of the Heritage Foundation who coined the term moral majority, declared in 1999, We probably have lost the culture war. Leaders like James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, began warning that evangelicals would bolt from the Republican Party.We were both saying to the party, you cant play games with this issue. So it was serious, said Gary Bauer, a candidate for president in 2000 who worked with Dobson. Many people felt that Republican leaders had to be educated about where their own voters were.Conservatives are winning the battle for Americas courts, a triumph decades in the making. This is how they did it. Video Dalton Bennett, Jesse Mesner-Hage, Jorge RibasThe Washington PostThe anger had the effect of solidifying support. When President George W. Bush nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court in 2005, the response was fierce. She had spoken about self-determination guiding abortion decisions and gave confusing answers on the right to privacy.There was a tremendous backlash, Bauer said.Miers withdrew her nomination within weeks. Her replacement as a nominee, Samuel Alito, was easily confirmed. He became the author of the draft opinion completely overturning Roe that leaked last week from the Supreme Court.ConsolidationReturn to menuThe consolidation of the antiabortion movements political power would only continue in the coming years, as the parties sorted themselves along culture war lines, even as the nations overall view of abortion remained constant.According to Gallup, the share of Americans who do not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe was 58 percent in both 1989 and 2021. In 1975, 22 percent of Americans wanted abortion illegal in all circumstances, compared to 19 percent in 2021.But the share of Democrats who said abortion should be legal under any circumstances rose from 19 percent to 50 percent between 1975 and 2021. The share of Republicans who want to outlaw all abortion went from 25 percent to 31 percent.In the Senate today, there are only three Democrats who oppose using federal funds for abortions. In the House, there is just one, and he is locked in a tight primary battle.The 2010 midterm elections were a major turning point in the partisan shift. Antiabortion Democrats were voted out of office for having supported the Affordable Care Act, which allows plans in the insurance marketplaces to cover abortion, although states are allowed to ban such coverage. At the same time, a new generation of Republican lawmakers who prioritized cultural issues were swept into office.How women are talking about the possible end of Roe v. WadeThe Republican midterm wins also gave states new powers to redraw legislative district lines, further growing the power of antiabortion forces in Republican-dominated states.The pushback to Obamas pro-abortion policies was so pronounced at the state level, said Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, who credits the former Democratic president with propelling the antiabortion cause. We began to see this wave of pro-life legislation.By the fall of 2011, antiabortion advocates had started pushing for bold restrictions with brash new tactics. When Janet Porter introduced the first heartbeat bill in the country to ban abortions after six weeks, she showed up in the Ohio Statehouse with ultrasound videos to demonstrate the cardiac activity of a fetus, which she described as the youngest person to ever speak at the Ohio Statehouse.Over 200 antiabortion restrictions were enacted between 2011 and 2013, more than had taken effect for the entire previous decade.We sent a signal that being pro-choice was a disqualifier, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List. Having an R next to your name was not enough.But even after 2010, when the vast majority of Republicans identified publicly as antiabortion, conservative advocates and lawmakers were bitterly divided on exactly how far that legislation should go. The most established antiabortion groups argued that proposed heartbeat bills went too far and would bait a liberal Supreme Court to issue a decision that might expand abortion rights even further.It was the right idea at the wrong time, said Michael Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life.The largest antiabortion groups, including National Right to Life, whose lawyer testified against the six-week ban in Ohio, had long taken a more incremental approach, pushing various clinic rules and restrictions that would make abortion care more difficult without banning the procedure outright, under the theory that such measures had a better chance of withstanding court challenges.National groups like Americans United for Life remained focused on a mother child strategy, which included talking about their belief that some forms of abortion are dangerous for the woman while pushing legislation that purported to make clinics safer. They sought to mandate clinics to widen their hallways or hire doctors with admitting privileges at local hospitals, moves that led to closure of some clinics.The Trump EraReturn to menuThe direction of the movement changed again when a New York businessman and television personality suddenly stormed his way into the 2016 Republican presidential nomination fight. With a documented personal life that did not lend itself to evangelical support, Trump made overturning Roe v. Wade a centerpiece of his campaign, at one point even suggesting that there needs to be some form of punishment for women who seek the procedure before backtracking.Here's a look back at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's changing views on abortion. Video Jenny StarrsThe Washington PostAt a lunch with more than a dozen others that year at the powerhouse law firm Jones Day, Trump said he wanted to make the Supreme Court a campaign priority, surprising some in the room, including Leo, a devout Catholic who regularly visits the Vatican. Leo told others it was easy to come up with list of judges that would please the Republican base because there were decades of conservative lawyers in the pipeline.The success of this movement has been the result of sharp and unwavering focus, growing public sentiment against overreach by judges, and consensus among conservative activists around a single principle that having judges who respect the limits on their power and who enforce the limits on the power of the rest of government, as set forth in the Constitution, is the best way to preserve the dignity and worth of all people in the long run, Leo said.Trump would benefit from the fact that when Scalia died unexpectedly in February 2016, McConnell immediately announced from a trip in the Virgin Islands that he would not replace him with Obamas nominee to the Supreme Court. McConnells critics called the move craven, and even some Republicans wondered if he could hold.Abortion rights leaders were furious. They broke all the rules, said Hagstrom Miller, who testified against Justice Neil M. Gorsuch during his confirmation hearings. It just feels like they lied and cheated and stole those really important roles, and now we cant rely on the justice system.Gorsuch, Trumps first Supreme Court nominee, was one of those included on the first list of six people that Leo had brought to Trump. Leo went to the White House in 2017 with a second list of five proposed candidates that included Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who would become Trumps next two picks for the high court, replacing the retiring Kennedy and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Leo, McGahn and McConnell became a team, working to keep the judicial nominations effort moving even as other parts of Trumps term fell victim to internal fighting. The three men usually agreed, with McGahn and Leo, among others, searching for nominees, and McConnell quickly confirming them. McConnell credited Trumps advisers for the picks and Trump himself for signing off on them.Republicans seek to change the subject on cusp of abortion winTrump would frequently ask advisers if his administration was setting records for judicial nominees, and if judicial candidates were tough and looked the part, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions. He never veered from the lists of candidates suggested by Leo and others, they said.Josh Holmes, a McConnell adviser, said it was an eternal campaign to keep the accolades rolling in so Trump would stay interested in the topic.Part of McConnells goal was to make sure that Trump was getting the accolades that he needed to keep on doing what he was doing, Holmes said. There was no shortage of effort to raise the profile of the judges issue so Trump would continue to have interest in it. Every time I saw Trump privately, hed say, Mitch McConnell. Judges. Judges. Judges. The only thing he wants is judges.A spokesman did not respond to a request to interview Trump for this story. Leo found he had extensive access in the White House, and that the judges issue moved quickly compared to previous White Houses, he told others.After Gorsuchs confirmation in 2017, Trump was delighted by the progress. Flying on Air Force One, Trump raved to McConnell and others about what a good nominee he had been, according to Rep. Garland Andy Barr R-Ky., who told the story on the Ruthless podcast last week.And he went on for a pretty good while with his monologue about how this was the greatest choice ever to the United States Supreme Court. And at some point, after about 10 minutes or so, the president took a breath, Barr recalled. When there was a pause in the action, leader McConnell didnt miss a beat. He kind of leaned forward and he said, 'Mr. President, when are you going to thank me for that?Ironically, the two men who had played such a central role in reshaping the nations judiciary have not spoken since the end of 2020, after Trump turned on McConnell for not attempting to overturn the results of the election he lost.By the end of his presidency, in part because of the 2020 death of Ginsburg, Trump had named over 220 conservative judges to the federal bench. Abortion rights advocates were helpless to stop the transformation, which culminated in the confirmation of Barrett, who took the oath of office eight days before Trump lost reelection.The most devastating gut punch was when Justice Ginsburg died, said Kristin Ford, the vice president of communications and research at NARAL, a national abortion rights group. I remember bracing for how much worse things were going to get.The AftermathReturn to menuThe sudden shift in the makeup of the high court opened the floodgates in state legislatures. At least nine states passed abortion bans in 2019 that clearly violated Roe, which protects abortion up to the point of viability, around 22 to 24 weeks, each hoping their law would make it all the way up to an increasingly conservative Supreme Court.In May 2021, the activists got what they were looking for when the Supreme Court agreed to consider a ban from Mississippi that outlawed abortion at 15 weeks in the case thats now poised to overturn Roe.By the time the Southern Baptist Convention gathered last year, they had fully repudiated their past views, embracing an aggressive approach that some in the antiabortion movement had rebuffed just a few years before.Some Supreme Court justices might contradict their confirmation hearing testimony if they side with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.s draft opinion on abortion. Video Blair GuildThe Washington PostWe will not embrace an incremental approach alone to ending abortion because it challenges Gods Lordship over the heart and the conscience and rejects His call to repent of sin completely and immediately, the platform read.Meanwhile, antiabortion advocates in Texas decided not to wait for a Supreme Court ruling. Frustrated by all the bans that had been blocked by the courts, former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell developed a novel legal strategy with lawmakers to evade a court challenge empowering private citizens to enforce the law. The gambit worked.PRAISE THE LORD! Texas state representative Matt Schaefer R texted Mitchell just after the Supreme Court ruled in early September to allow the six-week abortion ban in Texas to take effect.That night, Mitchell let the significance of the moment sink in. It was the first time a state had successfully imposed a six-week abortion ban since Roe v. Wade, he said.U.S. abortion access, reproductive rightsTracking abortion access in the United States Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v.

As of the early 2020s, abortion debate in the United States saw the Supreme Court as a central battleground, especially with Roe v. Wade’s uncertain future and states increasingly challenging federal abortion protections.

Political Realignment and Consolidation

By the late 20th century, anti-abortion movements gained substantial influence, as both political parties became more polarized on the issue. Despite steady public support for abortion rights (Gallup reports showed that around 58% of Americans consistently opposed overturning Roe), the issue solidified partisan lines, with Republicans generally advocating for stricter abortion laws and Democrats largely supporting abortion rights. Notably, anti-abortion Democrats almost disappeared by the 2010s, as conservative Republicans won state and federal offices, pushing legislation focused on limiting abortion.

Strategic Shifts in Anti-Abortion Tactics

The 2010 midterm elections were pivotal, with Republicans gaining control of redistricting processes and sweeping anti-abortion legislation at the state level. Initially, anti-abortion advocates pursued incremental restrictions, like mandating clinic safety standards, which led to the closure of some clinics and skirted more direct constitutional challenges to Roe. However, more assertive measures—such as six-week “heartbeat bills”—eventually took hold, indicating a shift towards more aggressive legislative approaches.

Influence of the Trump Administration

Donald Trump’s presidency marked another significant shift. Despite his initially mixed stance on abortion, Trump capitalized on judicial appointments, making the Supreme Court a campaign priority. Backed by figures like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, Trump appointed over 220 conservative judges, including three Supreme Court justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. These appointments solidified a conservative majority on the Court, which had repercussions for abortion rights and other cultural issues.

State Responses and Texas’s Legal Innovation

In 2021, Texas enacted a six-week abortion ban using a legal maneuver that allowed private citizens, rather than the state, to enforce the ban, sidestepping court challenges. The law effectively restricted abortion access in Texas and inspired other states to adopt similar legislation, circumventing traditional judicial review and creating a precedent for state-driven enforcement mechanisms.

The Aftermath and Future Implications

As of 2021, several states passed abortion bans anticipating that the conservative Supreme Court might uphold them. The Supreme Court’s decision to consider Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban brought the issue of Roe v. Wade’s survival to the forefront. The Southern Baptist Convention, among other religious groups, repudiated prior incremental approaches, pushing instead for an immediate end to abortion.

Today, the national landscape shows a patchwork of abortion laws varying by state, with ongoing battles expected in court and through state-level referendums. With major implications for the 2024 election, abortion remains a polarizing issue likely to influence candidates, legislation, and the judiciary for years to come."

The presence of hard-praying anti-abortionists from 40 Days for Life, a group based in Texas, outside Scottish hospitals and clinics has prompted Ms Sturgeon to back legislation that would allow no-go buffer zones around abortion providers.

The latest began on September 28th. Though the group says it discourages volunteers most of whom are locals from using graphic images of aborted fetuses and yelling, it has attracted some protesters who do. Shawn Carney, its co-founder and chief executive, says that doesnt worry him. Our main concern is the bigotry of the government, he says. Sturgeondoesnt like us, so she wants to get rid of us. If the buffer law is passed, he says We will sue.Mr Carneys group is one of several American pro-life organisations that are stepping up their activities in Britain. CBR UK, an affiliate of the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform, a Californian anti-abortion outfit that disseminates particularly gruesome images, says its British network of volunteer educators, who set up street displays, has grown from 50 a decade ago to 500. Dave Brennan, head of the groups church ministry, says it wants to double that within a year. The group is currently focusing on universities. Stanton Health Care, from Idaho, which operates clinics that try to dissuade women from terminating pregnancies, opened in Belfast in 2015 and will do so in Edinburgh this year. British pro-lifers hope that they can learn from the long and successful campaign to overturn Roe v Wade, the American Supreme Court ruling of 1973 that enshrined the right to an abortion. American pro-lifers have also played prominent roles in campaigns to keep children on life support alive against the wishes of their doctors and the courts.Such activists are often supported in their efforts by ADF UK, the British chapter of Alliance Defending Freedom, an American conservative legal-advocacy group, which opened in 2015. With Christian Concern, a British association of similarly crusading lawyers, it set up the Wilberforce Academy, which trains young people for Christ-centred leadership. Freedom of speech and of religious expressionissues that have been more prominent in America than Britainare at the heart of ADF UKs battles. Its lawyers represented a midwifery student at Nottingham University who faced an investigation over her public opposition to abortion. In 2020 the university apologised and settled. The following year ADF UK helped a Catholic priest from Glasgow successfully challenge the governments attempt to close churches during lockdown.Future campaigns seem likely to focus on the push to introduce abortion buffer zones. In America ADF sued to strike down a law allowing such zones in Massachusetts and won. Though the British Pregnancy Advisory Service says protests outside clinics are becoming more common, a policy on buffer zones across England and Wales seems unlikely soon. In 2018 Sajid Javid, then the home secretary, said there was little need for one. Yet several councils have established their own zones or are considering doing so. The Supreme Court has been asked to consider whether a prospective law allowing buffer zones in Northern Ireland would disproportionately affect the right to protest.Claims that buffer zones criminalise free speech have begun to influence anti-abortionists arguments more widely, according to Lucy Grieve, co-founder of Back Off Scotland. She set up the group in 2020 to oppose protests in Edinburgh, where she is a student. She has noticed a shift, she says, away from moral objections to abortion to talk about free speech. That is good news for Mr Carney of 40 Days for Life. Even pro-choice Britons agree with him about its importance, he says. Freedom of speech is being butchered in Scotland. They can ban usbut they cant do that and call themselves a free democracy.

These groups, including those from the US, are working to influence public opinion on abortion and have been involved in efforts to introduce “buffer zones” around abortion clinics, where protests are restricted.

40 Days for Life, which holds 40-day vigils at abortion clinics twice a year, is a prominent example. While the group discourages confrontational tactics like graphic images, some volunteers have still resorted to such methods. Shawn Carney, co-founder of 40 Days for Life, insists that the group’s activities should not be viewed as disruptive protests, despite opposition from figures like Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon supports laws that would create buffer zones to prevent protests near clinics, which Carney has vowed to challenge if passed.

Other American-based groups, like CBR UK, have expanded their operations in Britain, with volunteer numbers growing. They aim to mirror the success of the US anti-abortion movement, particularly after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Groups like Stanton Health Care have also set up clinics in the UK, where they attempt to dissuade women from abortion. The legal arm of these efforts is supported by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF UK), which has backed legal cases in favor of free speech and religious freedom, including a notable case where a midwifery student in the UK was investigated for opposing abortion.

There is also significant debate over the introduction of buffer zones in the UK. While some local councils have already established them, the government has been reluctant to implement a national policy. Pro-life advocates argue that such zones infringe on free speech rights, a position that has gained traction in Scotland, where protests have become more common. Critics of buffer zones assert that they undermine democracy and free expression, even among some pro-choice individuals who support freedom of speech.

In summary, American pro-life groups are actively expanding their influence in Britain, with a focus on opposing abortion, promoting free speech, and challenging potential laws that would restrict protests at abortion clinics. These efforts are reshaping the debate around abortion rights and free expression in the UK."

Searcht Updates Countries Disasters Organizations Topics Jobs Training Informing humanitarians worldwide 247 a service provided by UN OCHA Chad 8 more Sahel project helps women raise themselves, their communities from poverty Format News and Press Release Source UNFPA Posted 16 Jun 2020 Originally published Origin View original Ms. Brema trains women in her village to become electricians. Vincent TremeauBanque mondiale AM TIMAM, Chad Once, Adouia Brema was a child bride forced to leave school. Today, she gives her community the gift of light. Her journey from vulnerable teen mother to solar cell electrician shows the remarkable feats that marginalized women and girls can achieve when they are empowered with information and economic opportunities. I was only 13 years old when I got married. The day I got married, I was in sixth grade, Ms. Brema recalled. At first, they let me continue going to school. Then I gave birth to my first two children. I found myself all alone in the house and I had to drop out of school so that I could take care of my home and my children. Today, I have eight children. Her experience is not unique Chad has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world 67 per cent of young women were married before age 18, according to the 2019 State of World Population report. For many child brides, marriage means a swift exit from schooling and entry into motherhood. They are less able to advocate for themselves, have less access to health services and higher vulnerability to violence. Their communities forgo the full fruit of their potential. But change is possible. Not just a mans job The Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Project SWEDD gives women and girls across West Africa vocational training so that they can earn more and have a better future. The project also strengthens girls education, increases access to reproductive health services, and engages whole communities on issues including child marriage, human rights and gender equality. Through SWEDD, Ms. Brema enrolled in a course to become an electrician. At first, we thought that electricity, with all those wires, was a mans job, she said. We felt like we couldnt do it. But we were told not to panic. We could do it. She and her classmates learned quickly. We started to grasp some of the notions, such as solar panels, batteries and all of the electrical connections, she said. I was able to learn the basics in two weeks, and I started to work on my first electrical installations with no fear. Now we have a business. Empowered women lift the community In Chad and other countries where it is working, SWEDD has already provided professional training to more than 154,000 women. When marginalized women and girls are able to access information and opportunities, the benefits accrue to their whole families and communities. Ms. Bremas own experience bears this out. With her business, she and her partners have been able to provide low-cost lighting to their community members. Once the panels have been installed, electricity is free because it comes from the sun, she said. You get electricity day and night. Children use it all the time. Ms. Brema also trains other women in the village. Before, I depended on my husband. But today, we make a profit from each installation. Ever since I learned how to do a paid job, Ive wanted my sisters to follow my example. If they learn skills, they will be able to work and earn money too. Expanding opportunities The World Bank recently approved 376 million in additional funds to support the implementation of SWEDDs phase 2, which brings the World Bank's overall support to 680 million. In addition to supporting existing initiatives, the new injection of funding will help governments strengthen legal frameworks that support womens rights to health and education. Parliamentarians, judges and lawyers have already been consulted for this part of the project. Joining phase 2 are the West Africa Health Organization and the African Union. UNFPA will continue to implement SWEDD and provide technical guidance. The countries implementing the project are Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cte dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and the programme will soon roll out in Cameroun and Guinea. Most recently, UNFPA has supported SWEDD in the regional campaign StrongerTogether, which has the rallying cry My empowerment, my future, even in times of crisis! The campaign shares information about COVID-19, positive gender roles, water and sanitation, and menstrual hygiene. It also highlights distance learning for girls and the importance of having them return to school. We men must seize this time of crisis to be role models for our sons by supporting our wives and daughters. Let's break the cycle of violence, and build a better world for our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters and for ourselves, the messages say. Protecting and promoting the rights of adolescent girls must be emphasized. As for Ms. Brema, she recently told UNFPA the pandemic has been hard on her family and business. Still, she has always said that with the right resources, women and girls can create a better world for all We will help each other and our combined efforts will make a better future, she said.

One of the featured stories is that of Adouia Brema, a former child bride, who became a solar cell electrician and now contributes to her community by providing affordable solar electricity. Brema’s journey reflects the positive changes SWEDD fosters by providing women with vocational training, educational opportunities, and access to reproductive health services.

In Chad, where 67% of young women are married before 18, child marriage often leads to early motherhood, limited education, and economic dependence. SWEDD works to change this, offering training in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as electrical work. Brema’s success has inspired other women in her community to pursue similar opportunities, leading to greater financial independence and improved quality of life.

Through SWEDD, over 154,000 women have received professional training, and the program has had a broader impact by addressing issues like child marriage and gender equality. This initiative, supported by the World Bank, has also led to a legal framework strengthening women’s rights to health and education. The ongoing phase 2 of the project, backed by $376 million in funding, will expand these efforts and include new regional partners like the African Union.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SWEDD also launched the StrongerTogether campaign to promote positive gender roles, provide information on sanitation, and encourage girls’ education. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, Brema remains optimistic about the future, believing that women and girls, when given the right resources, can build a better world."
DeSantis' abortion ban: What's legal and what's illegal in Florida?,"DeSantis' abortion ban What's legal and what's illegal in Florida?News Sports Entertainment Opinion Email Us Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals STATEAbortions in Florida Now that Roe v. Wade is gone, here's what's legal and what's not C. A. BridgesTallahassee DemocratUPDATE FDA rules abortion pills may be dispensed in pharmaciesOn Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that constitutionally established the right to abortion.That passed abortion laws to the states, where Republican lawmakers quickly began to ban abortion in about half of them while some Democratic-led states worked to reinforce protections for the procedure. Access to abortion, in other words, now depends almost entirely on where you live. What does that mean to Floridians?In April of that year, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state's most restrictive abortion regulations since Roe v. Wade, banning nearly all abortions in Florida after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest.The law went into effect July 1, was briefly stopped by a Leon County judge who called it a likely violation of the state constitutions right to privacy., and then went back into effect when the state appealed.Here's what the new law means for pregnant people in Florida.'Dream bigger'How weekend marches keep advocates' fight for Roe v. Wade alive on 50th anniversaryEnforcementOnline data, medical records could be used to put women in jail under new abortion lawsBlocked, appealedFlorida appeals judge's order to block abortion law, leaving in place new 15-week lawWhat does overturning Roe v. Wade mean?Previously Florida's new abortion law may have faced a constitutional challenge since it was more restrictive than Roe v. Wade. That is no longer the case.What does Florida's abortion ban do?As of July 1, the ""Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality"" law HB 5 bans all abortions at 15 weeks and later. The only exceptions are if carrying the pregnancy to term would result in serious injury or death for the mother or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. Two physicians must certify, in writing, that one of those conditions warrants the procedure. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.The new law redefines ""gestation"" from ""between fertilization and birth"" to ""as calculated from the first day of the pregnant woman's last menstrual period.""15-week abortion banFlorida Gov.

WadeDoes the Florida abortion bill make exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking or mental health?No. Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate defeated amendments that would have made exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and mental health. ""After 15 weeks, that is a child. And so the argument is, should you kill a baby after 15 weeks because it was conceived under certain circumstances?"" Senate President Wilton Simpson said.Abortion bill amendments blockedDespite attempts to block it, Florida Senate prepares abortion ban for final vote this weekDoes Florida have a waiting period for abortions?Yes. As of April the state requires anyone seeking an abortion wait 24 hours after an initial doctors visit before returning to undergo the procedure.Waiting periodAfter 7 year legal battle, Leon County judge signs off on Florida abortion waiting periodCan minors get an abortion in Florida?Florida required minors seeking an abortion to notify at least one parent 48 hours before an abortion and obtain consent from a parent or approval from a judge through a legal mechanism known as judicial bypass.What happens to doctors who perform an abortion after 15 weeks?If a physician violates the ban, they would be guilty of a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a 5,000 fine. If I get an abortion after 15 weeks will I be charged with murder?Unlike Georgia's abortion laws, Florida's does not expressly define a fetus as a human being and there are currently no listed penalties for the person getting the abortion. The state's existing laws only penalize the doctors performing it or anyone actively participating in the procedure. If I'm pregnant in Florida and need an abortion after 15 weeks, what do I do?If your pregnancy threatens your life or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, or if the fetus has not achieved viability and has a fatal abnormality, you still can get an abortion but you would need to get two physicians to certify that in writing first. Otherwise, you would need to travel out of state, and you may need to drive a while. Like Texas, Georgia bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually about six weeks, often before some people even know they're pregnant.Florida's laws still are more lenient than other states, including the ones that border us.As mind-boggling as it sounds, even with the 15-week restriction, we will be seen as a haven state, said Alexandra Mandado, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida.Many states with newly-restrictive laws and states with bills ready to go are expected to increase restrictions or ban abortion outright now that the Supreme Court decision has come down.Which states have banned abortion or made it illegal?There are 44 states with some ban on abortions after a certain point in a pregnancy, according to The Guttmacher Institute, an organization that works to study, educate, and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.Twelve states Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennesee, Texas, and West Virginia ban abortions entirely.Georgia bans them at 6 weeks.Two states, Florida and Arizona, ban them at 15 weeks.North Carolina bans them at 20 weeks.Nine states, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin, ban abortions at 22 weeks.Nevada, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania ban them at 24 weeks.14 states California. Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, MInnesota, Montana, New York, Rhode Island, Washington and Wyoming ban abortions at the point of viability.Virginia bans abortion at the beginning of the third trimeser of pregnancy, 25 weeks.Many of these states are currently attempting to further restrict abortion or already have new laws on the books that have been blocked or contested in courts.Are abortion pills still legal in Florida?Sort of. In 2021 the Food and Drug Administration permanently removed a key restriction on medication used to terminate pregnancies, allowing so-called ""abortion pills"" to be available by mail and prescribed through telehealth medical consultations due to pandemic restrictions, and in January of this year they announced that they could be dispensed in some pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens. The U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills even in states that have banned or restricted abortion access, the Department of Justice announced, since senders cannot know if the recipient will us them illegally.But Florida law requires the physical presence of a doctor for the abortion process, which includes talking to the patient 24 hours before the procedure, so telehealth consultations are not permitted and other abortion restrictions apply. Medical abortions must be performed within the first 11 weeks of pregnancy, an even tighter deadline than the state's.The abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, also must be prescribed, although people in states where telehealth abortions are banned have started driving over the border to states where they are not, as that can be considerably cheaper than driving to a possibly-far-off and overbooked clinic. The day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department will protect providers and anyone seeking abortions in states where it is legal. In particular, Garland said the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of mifepristone for medical abortions.Medical abortion Qu0026AAre abortion pills safe?

A majority of counties do not have an abortion clinic.When does the new Florida abortion law take effect?The law took effect July 1, 2022.The 15-week ban is facing two lawsuits, one from a group of Planned Parenthood affiliates and independent providers, and another from a Palm Beach County synagogue. Both challenges seek to block the ban from going into effect and charge that it violates the state constitutions privacy amendment.What other restrictions on abortion does Florida have?Along with the restricted time period, abortion law in Florida currently requires that 24 hours before an abortion can occur, the physician performing it or a referring physician must, while physically in the same room, inform the patient of the physical risks of both getting an abortion and carrying the pregnancy to term and the probable gestational age of the fetus as determined by mandatory ultrasound.The physician must also provide state-directed counseling materials. The patient may refuse to look at the ultrasound.How many abortions are done in Florida?There were 79,648 abortions performed in 2021 in Florida, of which 59,252 74 were listed as elective, according to data from the state Agency for Health Care Administration. About 75,000 of them occurred in the first trimester, or the first 12 to 13 weeks of pregnancy, compared with 4,850 in the second, according to state data.State data shows 16,822 abortions were done because of social or economic reasons and 1,503 abortions were for the psychological health of the mother. Another 1,060 abortions were for the health of the mother yet not for life-endangering reasons, the data shows.There were 757 abortions due to serious fetal genetic defect, deformity or abnormality, another 119 abortions were performed because of a life-endangering condition to the mother, eight abortions were performed because of incest and 118 were done because of rape.Of the abortions because of serious genetic defect or some other abnormality, the state data shows 64 of them, or 484 abortions, were done in the second trimester. The second trimester starts at week 13 and ends at week 26, according to the Mayo Clinic.Do Florida doctors support the new abortion ban?Some do, many don't. Roughly 700 physicians in Florida signed an open letter to the state Legislature opposing the 15-week abortion ban, calling it an alarming attempt to improperly insert politics into the patient-clinician relationship and said the consequences for Floridians would be dire.This legislation is bad medicine and bad policy, and we urge you to reject it for numerous reasons, the letter states.Do Florida voters support the new abortion ban?According to a poll by the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Laboratory, 55 percent of voters surveyed opposed the abortion bill. Opposition grew to 60 percent when people were told it didnt make exceptions for victims of rape or incest.Thirty-four percent of the people surveyed supported the idea, according to a release from UNF.Gallup PollMost Americans identify as pro-choice and believe abortion is 'morally acceptable'UNF pollMost voters don't back abortion ban, 'Don't Say Gay' bills in Florida LegislatureWill Florida pass more restrictive abortion laws?Quite possibly.Gov. DeSantis has not committed to whether he supports the so-called""heartbeat"" abortion bill, so named because of the belief that a detectable human heartbeat can be heard at that point. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many pregnant people realize they are pregnant.But he has said that he wants to ""sign great life legislation, and he has previously said he wants to ""expand pro-life protections.""Contributors Liz Freeman, Naples Daily News James Call, Florida Capital Bureau Kathryn Varn, GannettUSA Today Network - Florida C.

Wade, which returned the authority to regulate abortion to individual states. Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in April 2022, restricting abortion access after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Here’s a summary of the key points:
	1.	15-Week Abortion Ban: The law, effective July 1, 2022, bans most abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions only for cases where the mother’s life is at risk or the fetus has a fatal abnormality. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. This law redefines gestation from fertilization to the first day of the last menstrual period.
	2.	Enforcement and Penalties: Doctors who perform abortions after the 15-week limit face criminal penalties, including up to five years in prison and a fine of $5,000. However, individuals seeking abortions are not penalized under this law.
	3.	Waiting Period and Parental Consent for Minors: A 24-hour waiting period is required, and minors must notify a parent 48 hours before the procedure, or seek judicial approval for a bypass.
	4.	Abortion Pills: Abortion pills are allowed in Florida but must be prescribed by a doctor and can only be used within the first 11 weeks of pregnancy. Florida law requires in-person consultations, meaning telehealth options for abortion are not permitted.
	5.	Public Opinion and Legal Challenges: Public opinion is divided, with 55% of Floridians opposing the new law, especially its lack of exceptions for rape and incest. The law is being challenged in court by groups like Planned Parenthood, but it is currently in effect.
	6.	Abortion Access in Other States: While Florida’s law restricts abortion to 15 weeks, neighboring states like Georgia impose bans at 6 weeks. Some states, like California and New York, protect abortion rights more broadly.
	7.	Future Legislation: There is speculation that Florida may pass even stricter laws in the future, including a potential “heartbeat” law, which would ban abortion at around 6 weeks of pregnancy when a fetal heartbeat can be detected.

In conclusion, while Florida’s 15-week abortion ban is one of the more restrictive laws in the country, the state still provides relatively more access than others with stricter bans. Legal and political challenges are ongoing, and public opinion remains divided on the issue."

But I did not know much about the legal issues involved, or the theological arguments for a womans right to choose abortion.As you will see, the debate is much more complex than either sides rhetoric might indicate. But I believe that there is an ethical position which even our relativistic society might embrace.Pro-life vs. pro-choiceAn abortion occurs when a conceptus is caused to die. To clarify vocabulary, conceptus is a general term for pre-born life growing in the mothers womb.More specifically, doctors often speak of the union of a sperm and an ovum as a zygote. A growing zygote is an embryo. When the embryo reaches around seven weeks of age, it is called a fetus. However, fetus is usually used in the abortion debate to describe all pre-born life.A miscarriage is a spontaneous, natural abortion.An indirect abortion occurs when actions taken to cure the mothers illness cause the unintended death of the fetus.A direct abortion occurs when action is taken to cause the intended death of the fetus.Why do so many people in America believe that a mother should have the right to choose direct abortion?In 1973, the Supreme Court issued Roe v. Wade, its landmark abortion ruling. In essence, the Court overturned state laws limiting a womans right to abortion. Its decision was largely based on the argument that the Constitution nowhere defines a fetus as a person or protects the rights of the unborn.Rather, the Court determined that an unborn baby possesses only potential life and is not yet a human being or person. It argued that every constitutional reference to person relates to those already born. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees protections and rights to individuals, but the Court ruled that the amendment does not include the unborn.The Court further determined that a womans right to privacy extends to her ability to make her own choices regarding her health and body. Just as she has the right to choose to become pregnant, she has the right to end that pregnancy.The Court suggested several specific reasons why she might choose abortionspecific and direct harm may come to hermaternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and futurepsychological harm may be imminentmental and physical health may be taxed by child careproblems may occur associated with bearing unwanted childrenand the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood should be considered.Since 1973, four positions have been taken in the abortion debateThere should be no right to an abortion, even to save the life of the mother. This has been the Catholic Churchs usual position.Therapeutic abortions can be performed to save the mothers life.Extreme case abortions can be permitted in cases of rape, incest, or severe deformation of the fetus. Most pro-life advocates would accept therapeutic and extreme case abortions.Abortion should be available to any woman who chooses it. This is the typical pro-choice position.Moral arguments for abortionPro-choice advocates make five basic claimsNo one can say when a fetus becomes a person, so the mother is the most appropriate person to make decisions regarding it.Abortion must be protected so a woman who is the victim of rape or incest does not have to bear a child resulting from such an attack.No unwanted child should be brought into the world.The state has no right to legislate personal morality.A woman must be permitted to make pregnancy decisions in light of her life circumstances.Many theologians, pastors, and denominational leaders consider these claims to be both biblical and moral.First, pro-choice proponents argue that a fetus is not legally a person.They agree with the Supreme Courts finding that the Constitution nowhere grants legal standing to a pre-born life. Only 40 to 50 percent of fetuses survive to become persons in the full sense. A fetus belongs to the mother until it attains personhood and is morally subject to any action she wishes to take with it.Second, abortion must be protected as an alternative for women who are the victims of rape or incest.While this number is admittedly small in this country approximately one percent of all abortions, it is growing in many countries around the world. As many as one in three women may become the victim of such an attack. They must be spared the further trauma of pregnancy and childbirth.Third, no unwanted children should be brought into the world.If a woman does not wish to bear a child, she clearly will not be an appropriate or effective mother if the child is born. Given the population explosion occurring in many countries of the world, abortion is a necessary option for women who do not want children. The woman is more closely involved with the fetus than any other individual and is the best person to determine whether or not this child is wanted and will receive proper care.Fourth, the state has no right to legislate our personal moral decisions.The government has no authority to restrict homosexuality, consensual sex, cigarette consumption, or other individual decisions that many people consider to be wrong. Since there is no constitutional standard for when life begins, decisions made regarding a fetus are likewise a matter for individual morality.The state should impose legislation on moral questions only when this legislation expresses the clear moral consensus of the community and when it prevents conduct which obviously threatens the public welfare. Nearly everyone condemns murder, for instance, and believes that it threatens us all. But Americans are divided on the morality of abortion. It is hard to see how aborting a fetus threatens the rest of the community.And so abortion should not be subject to governmental control. It is better to allow a mother to make this decision than to legislate it through governmental action. Many who personally consider abortion to be wrong are persuaded by this argument and thus support the pro-choice position.Fifth, the rights and concerns of the mother must take precedence over those of the fetus.Even if we grant fetuses limited rights, they must not supersede the rights of mothers, as the latter are clearly persons under the Constitution. If we allow abortion to protect her physical life, we should do so to protect her emotional health or quality of life as well.This was one of the Courts most significant arguments, as it sought to protect the mothers mental and physical health. Many pro-choice advocates are especially persuaded by this argument and view the abortion debate within the context of a womans right to control her own life.Moral arguments against abortionPro-life advocates counter each of these claims with their own ethical arguments.First, they assert that a fetus is a human life and should be granted the full protection of the law.The fetus carries its parents genetic code and is a distinct person. It does not yet possess self-consciousness, reasoning ability, or moral awareness the usual descriptions of a person, but neither do newborns or young children. As this is the central issue of the debate, well say more about it in a moment.Second, most pro-life advocates are willing to permit abortion in cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother.Since such cases typically account for only one to four percent of abortions performed, limiting abortion to these conditions would prevent the vast majority of abortions occurring in America.Third, pro-life advocates agree that all children should be wanted, so they argue strongly for adoption as an alternative to abortion.They also assert that an unwanted child would rather live than die. By pro-choice logic, it would be possible to argue for infanticide and all forms of euthanasia as well as abortion.Fourth, pro-life supporters do not see abortion legislation as an intrusion into areas of private morality.Protecting the rights of the individual is the states first responsibility. No moral state can overlook murder, whatever the personal opinions of those who commit it. The state is especially obligated to protect the rights of those who cannot defend themselves.But what of the claim that legislation must always reflect the clear will of the majority and protect the public welfare?The collective will of the culture must never supersede what is right and wrong. For instance, marijuana is so popular that as many as 100 million Americans say theyve tried it at least once. Nonetheless, we ban it because its harmful effects are clear to medical science. The effects of abortion on a fetus are obviously much more disastrous to the fetus. And just because society is unclear as to when life begins does not mean that the question is unknowable.If more of the public understood the physical and ethical issues involved in abortion, the large majority would consider abortion to be a threat to public welfare. Abortion threatens the entire community in three waysAbortion ends the lives of millions, on a level exceeding all wars and disasters combined.Abortion encourages sexual promiscuity.Abortion permits women to make a choice that will plague many of them with guilt for years to come.And so abortion meets the standard for legislative relevance and must be addressed and limited or abolished by the state.Fifth, pro-life advocates want to encourage the health of both the mother and the child and do not believe that we must choose between the two.As the rights of a mother are no more important than those of her newborn infant, so they are no more important than those of her pre-born child. The stress, guilt, and long-term mental anguish reported by many who abort their children must be considered. The legal right to abortion subjects a woman to pressure from her husband or sexual partner to end her pregnancy. Killing the fetus for the sake of the mothers health is like remedying paranoia by killing all the imagined persecutors. For these reasons, pro-life advocates argue that a moral state must limit or prevent abortion.For more on the ethical arguments for and against abortion see Milton A. Gonsalves Right Reason Ethics in Theory and Practice, 9th ed.When does life begin?This is obviously the crucial question in the abortion debate.If life does not begin until the fetus is viable or the child is born, one can argue that the right to life does not extend to the pre-born and abortion should be considered both legal and moral.But if life begins at conception, there can be no moral justification for abortion, since this action kills an innocent person.There are essentially three answers to our questionFunctionalism states that the fetus is a person when it can act personally as a moral, intellectual, and spiritual agent. Note that by this definition, some question whether a newborn infant would be considered a person.Actualism is the position that a fetus is a person if it possesses the potential for developing self-conscious, personal life. This definition would permit abortion when the fetus clearly does not possess the capacity for functional life.Essentialism argues that the fetus is a person from conception, whatever its health or potential. It is an individual in the earliest stages of development and deserves all the protections afforded to other persons by our society.Our Declaration of Independence begins, We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If an unborn child is considered a person, it possesses the inalienable right to life as well.So, can we determine when life begins?Our answer depends on the definition of life.A pro-choice advocate recognizes that the fetus is alive in the sense that it is a biological entity. But so is every other part of a womans body. Some consider the fetus to be a growth and liken it to a tumor or other unwanted tissue. Biology alone is not enough to settle the issue.What about capacity?Many ethicists define a person as someone able to respond to stimuli, interact with others, and make individual decisions. A fetus meets the first two standards from almost the moment of its conception, and clearly cannot fulfill the third only because it is enclosed in its mothers body. Would a newborn baby fulfill these three conditions?What about individuality?If we view a fetus as a growth within the mothers body, it would be easier to sanction her choice to remove that growth if she wishes. But a fetus is distinct from its mother from the moment of its conception.It is alive it reacts to stimuli and can produce its own cells and develop them into a specific pattern of maturity.It is human, completely distinguishable from all other living organisms, possessing all forty-six human chromosomes, able to develop only into a human being.And it is complete nothing new will be added except the growth and development of what exists from the moment of conception.It is a scientific fact that every abortion performed in the United States is performed on a being so fully formed that its heart is beating and its brain activity can be measured on an EEG machine. At twelve weeks, the unborn baby is only about two inches long, yet every organ of the human body is clearly in place.Theologian Karl Barth described the fetus wellThe embryo has its own autonomy, its own brain, its own nervous system, its own blood circulation. If its life is affected by that of the mother, it also affects hers. It can have its own illnesses in which the mother has no part. Conversely, it may be quite healthy even though the mother is seriously ill. It may die while the mother continues to live. It may also continue to live after its mothers death, and be eventually saved by a timely operation on her dead body. In short, it is a human being in its own right. Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics Edinburgh T T Clark, 1985 1961 3.4.416.And note that you did not come from a fetusyou were a fetus. A fetus is simply a human life in the womb. It becomes a baby outside the womb. But it is the same physical entity in either place.For these reasons, pro-life advocates believe that the U. S. Supreme Court was wrong in deciding that a fetus is not a person entitled to the full protections of the law.Apart from spiritual or moral concerns, it is a simple fact of biology that the fetus possesses every attribute of human life we find in a newborn infant, with the exception of independent physical viability. Left unharmed, it will soon develop this capacity as well. If a life must be independently viable to be viewed as a person, a young child might well fail this standard, as would those of any age facing severe physical challenges.What does the Bible say about abortion?These statements are based on moral claims and legal arguments. They are intended to persuade society regardless of a persons religious persuasion. But many in our culture also want to know what the Bible says on this crucial subject.Does the Bible talk about abortion?The word abortion appears nowhere in the Bible.No one in the Bible is ever described as having an abortion, encouraging one, or even dealing with one.The Bible says nothing which specifically addresses our subject.And so many have concluded that the issue is not a biblical concern but a private matter. They say that we should be silent where the Bible is silent.Pro-life advocates counter that by this logic we should be silent regarding the Trinity since the word never appears in Scripture. Or marijuana and cocaine since they are not in a biblical concordance. However, these issues came after the biblical era, while abortion was common in the ancient world. So this argument doesnt seem relevant.If abortion is a biblical issue, why doesnt the Bible address it specifically?The answer is simple the Jewish people and first Christians needed no such guidance. It was an undeniable fact of their faith and culture that abortion was wrong. How do we know?Consider early statements on the subject.The Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides is a book of Jewish wisdom written between 50 BC and AD 50. They state that a woman should not destroy the unborn babe in her belly, nor after its birth throw it before the dogs and vultures as a prey.The Sibylline Oracles are an ancient work of Jewish theology. They include among the wicked two groups women who produce abortions and unlawfully cast their offspring away and sorcerers who dispense materials which cause abortions 2339-42.The Mishnah instruction was the written record of Jewish oral teachings transmitted since the time of Moses. These teachings were committed to writing around 200 B.C. In the Mishnah tractate Sanhedrin we read We infer the death penalty for killing an embryo from the text, He who sheds the blood of a man within a man, his blood shall be shed what is a man within a man? An embryo Sanhedrin 57b, quoting Genesis 96.An abortion was permitted only to save the life of the mother If a woman was in hard travail life-threatening labor, the child must be cut up while it is in the womb and brought out member by member, since the life of the mother has priority over the life of the child but if the great part of it was already born, it may not be touched, since the claim of one life cannot override the claim of another life Oholoth 76.The Jews in the Old and New Testaments did not need to address the issue of abortion since no one considered it a moral option. In a similar vein, I have never preached a sermon against cigarette smoking or plagiarism. The Bible does not specifically speak to these subjects, and they are legal within certain limits, but no one in our congregation would consider them to be moral or healthy choices.When the Christian church moved out of its Jewish context, it encountered a culture that accepted the practice of abortion. And so, after the New Testament, Christians began speaking specifically to the subject.For instance, the Didache the earliest theological treatise after the Bible states You shall not procure an abortion, nor destroy a newborn child. And the Epistle of Barnabas early second century adds, Thou shalt love thy neighbor more than thy own life. Thou shalt not procure abortion, thou shalt not commit infanticide. These books were widely read and accepted in the first centuries of the Christian church.Important biblical passages about abortionWhile the Bible does not use the word abortion, it contains a number of texts that relate directly to the beginning of life and the value of all persons. Lets look briefly at the most pertinent passages.Exodus 2122Pro-choice scholars usually begin the discussion with this statement in Exodus When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the womans husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine. If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe Exodus 2122-25.The ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus commented on this text He that kicks a woman with child, so that the woman miscarry, let him pay a fine in money, as the judges shall determine, as having diminished the multitude by the destruction of what was in her womb and let money also be given to the womans husband by him that kicked her but if she die of the stroke, let him also be put to death, the law judging it equitable that life should go for life.But notice the translators note The law seems rather to mean, that if the infant be killed, though the mother escape, the offender must be put to death and not only when the mother is killed, as Josephus understood it. And note this later statement by Josephus The law, moreover, enjoins us to bring up all our offspring, and forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward and if any woman appears to have done so, she will be a murderer of her child, by destroying a living creature, and diminishing human kind.If this text does indeed teach that a person causing a miscarriage is only to be fined, while one causing harm is to receive severe punishment, we would have an important indication that the fetus is not as valuable as its mother. Is this what the text clearly teaches?The New Revised Standard renders the text, so that there is a miscarriage. The New American Standard follows suit, as does the New Jerusalem Bible. But the New International Version translates the text, she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury. The New Living Translation similarly states, they hurt a pregnant woman so that her child is born prematurely. If no further harm results . . . The English Standard Version renders the phrase, so that her children come out, but there is no harm. Why this crucial difference in translation?The Hebrew phrase is literally rendered, And they come forth children of her. Children is the plural of yeled, the usual Hebrew word for child or offspring the Hebrew language has no separate word for fetus or the pre-born. Come forth translates yatsa, a word which does not specify whether the child is alive or dead, only that it leaves the womb. And so the Hebrew of Exodus 2122 does not indicate whether the woman suffered a miscarriage NRSV, NASB, NJB or experienced a premature healthy birth NIV, NLT, ESV. But it does refer to the fetus as a child. And it is important to note that the text does not use shachol, the Hebrew word for miscarriage this word is found in Exodus 2326 and Hosea 914 among other occurrences.For further discussion of this linguistic issue see Jack W. Cottrells Abortion and the Mosaic Law in Readings in Christian Ethics.Verse 23 settles the issue for me But if there is serious injury . . . NIV, implying that no serious injury occurred in verse 22. In other words, both the mother and her child survived the attack and were healthy. And so this passage does not devalue the pre-born life or speak specifically to the issue of abortion.Genesis 27The Bible describes mans creation in this way In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung upfor the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the groundthen the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being Genesis 24-7.It seems that Adam did not become a living being until he could breathe. And so some believe that a fetus is not a living being until it can breathe outside the mothers womb. Until this time it is not yet a person. President Bill Clinton explained his pro-choice position as based significantly on this logic. He said that his pastor, W. O. Vaught, former pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, Arkansas, told him that this was the literal meaning of the text.There are three problems with this argument.Adam was an inanimate object until God breathed into him the breath of life, but we know conclusively that a fetus is animate from the moment of conception.The fetus breathes in the womb, exchanging amniotic fluid for air after birth.Adam in Genesis 27 was a potential life even before he became a human being. By any definition, a fetus is at the very least a potential human being. Well say more about this fact in a moment.Psalm 139One of Davids best-loved psalms contains this affirmationFor it was you who formed my inward partsyou knit me together in my mothers womb.I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully madeWonderful are your works that I know very well.My frame was not hidden from you,when I was being made in secret,intricately woven in the depths of the earth.Your eyes beheld my unformed substance.In your book were writtenall the days that were formed for me,when none of them as yet existed Psalm 13913-16.David clearly believed that God created him in his mothers womb and beheld my unformed substance before he was born. Pro-life theologians point to this declaration as proof that life is created by God and begins at conception.Of course, those who do not accept the authority of Scripture will not be persuaded by this argument. And some who do believe that Davids statement is poetic symbolism rather than scientific description. He is simply stating that he is Gods creation, without speaking specifically to the status of a fetus.Jeremiah 15As part of Gods call to the prophet Jeremiah, the Lord issued this declaration Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you I appointed you a prophet to the nations Jeremiah 15. God clearly formed Jeremiah in the womb and knew him even before that time. He consecrated or called him to special service even before he was born. Gods plan for Jeremiah began before his conception and his birth.Its hard for me to see how those who accept biblical authority could make a pro-choice response to this statement. I suppose they could claim that the verse is symbolic and spiritual, not scientific, that it is a metaphorical description of Gods eternal plan for Jeremiah. But the text seems to be specifically related to Jeremiahs conception and gestation.Luke 139-45Lukes gospel records the visit of the pregnant Mary to the pregnant Elizabeth In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord Luke 139-45.When Elizabeth said that the child in my womb leaped for joy v. 44, she made clear the fact that her fetus was a fully responding being. She used the word brephos, the Greek term for baby, embryo, fetus, newborn child, young child, or nursing child. It is the same word used to describe Jesus in the manger, where the shepherds went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger Luke 216.Paul used the word in reminding Timothy how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus 2 Timothy 315. The Bible makes no linguistic distinction between the personhood of a human being, whether before or after its birth.What are the rights of the innocent?The Bible consistently defends the rights of those who are innocent and undeserving of punishment or death. For instanceDo not kill the innocent and those in the right, for I will not acquit the guilty Exodus 237.There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that hurry to run to evil, a lying witness who testifies falsely, and one who sows discord in a family Proverbs 616-19.The Babylonians attacked Jerusalem for the sins of Manasseh, for all that he had committed, and also for the innocent blood that he had shed for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord was not willing to pardon 2 Kings 243-4.It is clear that God cares for the innocent and defenseless of the world. Children, whether before their birth or after, would be among his most valued creations.How have Christians viewed abortion?How has the Church viewed the issue of abortion across its history?Are pro-choice religious leaders in step with traditional Christian thinking on this subject? Or has the Church even spoken with a unified voice when addressing the question?Early church fathers were clear in their opposition to abortion.Athenagoras ca. AD 150, Clement of Alexandria ca. 150-215, Tertullian ca. 155-225, St. Hippolytus ca. 170-236, St. Basil the Great ca. 330-79, St. Ambrose ca. 339-97, St. John Chrysostom ca. 340-407, and St. Jerome ca. 342-420 all issued strong condemnations of this practice.However, these theologians did not specifically say when the body receives a soul. This is the process called animation or ensoulment by early philosophers. Many in the ancient world followed the thinking of Aristotle 384-322 B.C. on the issue. He believed that ensoulment occurred forty days after conception in males and ninety days in females, and taught that abortion prior to this time was not murder.St. Augustine of Hippo 354-430, arguably the greatest theological mind after Paul, can be quoted on both sides of the issue. As regards whether souls are given to bodies at conception, Augustine said, He . . . who formed them, knows whether He formed them with the soul, or gave the soul to them after they had been formed. . . . I have no certain knowledge how it came into my body for it was not I who gave it to myself. He was critical of a theologian who was too dogmatic on this issue, claiming, how much better it is for him to share my hesitation about the souls origin. He did not believe that we can know when people obtain their souls.And yet Augustine was convinced that those who die in the womb will be resurrected with the rest of humanity and given p","Here’s a comprehensive summary of this detailed examination of abortion from scientific, biblical, historical, and ethical perspectives:

The article continues with a close examination of abortion through biological, theological, and historical lenses. Pro-life advocates argue that a fetus is a distinct, complete, and fully human entity from conception, able to respond to stimuli, develop its own cells, and operate independently from the mother’s biological systems. Referencing theologians like Karl Barth, pro-life supporters highlight that a fetus possesses human characteristics including a heartbeat and brain activity detectable by modern technology. For these reasons, they contend that the fetus is not merely a growth within the mother but a unique life, deserving full legal protections.

The biblical argument against abortion is explored through various passages that imply a high value on unborn life. Though the Bible never explicitly discusses abortion, early Jewish and Christian teachings condemned it. For example, the Sentences of Pseudo-Phocylides and the Sibylline Oracles denounce abortion, indicating the cultural and religious stance against it in antiquity. The Mishnah, a significant Jewish text, allowed abortion only when the mother’s life was at risk, prioritizing maternal life but only up to a specific developmental threshold.

Early Christian writings like the Didache and the Epistle of Barnabas also explicitly condemned abortion, and prominent theologians like Athenagoras, Tertullian, and St. John Chrysostom strongly opposed it. However, opinions on the exact moment life begins varied, with early thinkers like Aristotle and St. Augustine debating the timing of “ensoulment”—or when the soul enters the body. Augustine, while uncertain of the soul’s timing, affirmed the resurrection of unborn children, reflecting a strong pro-life sentiment in traditional Christian thought.

Certain biblical texts are interpreted to support the pro-life position. For instance, Psalm 139 and Jeremiah 1:5 are cited as affirming God’s knowledge and design of individuals from conception, suggesting that life is sacred from its earliest stages. Additionally, Luke’s account of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth’s womb is used to underscore the fetus’s personhood.

The article also addresses translations of Exodus 21:22, which deals with injuries to pregnant women. Differences in translations have led to debate over whether the passage implies a fetus’s lesser value compared to its mother. However, certain interpretations uphold that this text considers fetal life significant, implying accountability for harm done to the unborn.

Finally, the article argues that the Bible consistently defends the rights of the innocent, suggesting that unborn children, as innocents, fall under this protection. Historical consensus among early church figures generally aligned with a strong pro-life stance, although the timing of “ensoulment” remained a theological mystery for some.

In sum, the article argues that both biblical teachings and early Christian tradition advocate a pro-life perspective, viewing the fetus as a fully human and autonomous life from conception, thus meriting the same protections as any other human being."

Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted about the bill he signed into law on April 14. photo Screenshot from GovRonDeSantis Twitter account last visisted 41522 Katie YoderCNA April 14, 2022 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill protecting the unborn from abortion after 15-weeks gestation on Thursday. During his remarks, he referred to the aborted babies recently found in Washington, D.C. What were doing today is saying that we will not let that happen in the state of Florida, the Republican politician said. Anti-abortion activists Lauren Handy and Terrisa Bukovinac of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising PAAU first told reporters on April 5 that they obtained 115 aborted babies from a driver for a medical-waste company outside a D.C. abortion facility, Washington Surgi-Clinic, with the intention of giving the unborn children a dignified funeral and burial. Five of the babies, who appear to be of late-term gestation, were located by the Metropolitan Police Department MPD on March 30. PAAU says it arranged for the D.C. police to collect and examine the babies, fearing that the babies injuries could be evidence of illegal abortions. Since then, lawmakers have sent multiple letters calling for a full investigation and autopsies of the babies bodies. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has given no indication that the city intends to autopsy the remains. DeSantis addressed what he called a terrible scandal. They found all these remains of babies, and they found five who were basically infants premature, they would have been, but they would have been able to survive outside the womb, he said. Yet Washington, D.C., is treating that just like we would treat the trash from our lunch or something like that. Its really horrifying to see that that could go on in our country, but particularly in our nations capital, he concluded, and he thanked the Daily Wires Mary Margaret Olohan for her coverage of the story. DeSantis signed into law House Bill 5 in Kissimmee, Florida. The legislation bans abortions in that state after an unborn baby reaches 15-weeks gestation, except to save the life or physical health of the mother and in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities. Were here today to defend those who cant defend themselves, DeSantis said. This will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation. In addition to providing protections for the unborn, DeSantis highlighted that the legislation expands efforts to reduce fetal-infant mortality cases and works to improve hospitals prenatal care. Previously, Florida law barred abortion after 24 weeks. Pro-life leaders such as Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser praised DeSantis and Florida legislators for the new law. Gov. DeSantis and the Florida Legislature have delivered a milestone victory for women and children, she said in a press release on Thursday. The legislation enacted today may save more than 3,300 lives a year by protecting unborn children, as well as their mothers, from cruel and dangerous late abortions. She concluded, As we await a decision in the Dobbs case, momentum is growing across America to modernize our extreme abortion laws. The new Florida law comes as the Supreme Court prepares to decide a highly anticipated case, Dobbs v. Jackson, which involves a 2018 Mississippi law restricting most abortions after 15 weeks. The case could potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, and leave abortion up to each individual state.

Sign Up","On April 14, 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law House Bill 5, which restricts abortions in the state after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving the mother’s life or in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities. DeSantis emphasized the law’s purpose of protecting the unborn, stating, “We’re here today to defend those who can’t defend themselves.” The law represents a significant shift from Florida’s previous 24-week abortion limit, aiming to reduce fetal and infant mortality and enhance prenatal care.

DeSantis linked the law to a recent discovery in Washington, D.C., where pro-life activists found the remains of 115 aborted babies. Five of the remains were of late-term babies who could have survived outside the womb. DeSantis condemned the situation as a “terrible scandal,” drawing attention to what he viewed as the dehumanization of the unborn in the capital. The discovery of these remains led to calls for investigations and autopsies, though D.C. officials have not agreed to conduct them.

Pro-life advocates, including Marjorie Dannenfelser from the Susan B. Anthony List, praised the new Florida law, which they believe could save thousands of lives each year. The law comes as the U.S. Supreme Court considers the Dobbs v. Jackson case, which could lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and allow individual states to decide on abortion laws. DeSantis’s law reflects the growing momentum among states to impose stricter abortion regulations ahead of this potential ruling."

Yet, de-democratization is rarely analysed through the lens of gender equality and, so far, efforts to systematically examine the implications for inclusive democracy and the representation of gender interests are fragmented. Backsliding on gender policies and on state commitments to gender equality, and new forms of feminist engagement with hostile governments and audiences, also raise new challenges to the literature on gender and politics. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to discuss these two interrelated realms backsliding on gender equality policies and the emerging political space for feminist responses to this backsliding. We illustrate our framework with empirical observations from three Central and Eastern European countries Croatia, Hungary, and Poland. We aim to contribute to an understanding of the gendered aspects of de-democratization and the functioning of illiberal democracies. This paper is part of the UN Women discussion paper series.

It highlights the growing trend of de-democratization in Europe and the Americas, which is accompanied by opposition to gender equality and threats to prior achievements in gender policy. While the issue of de-democratization is often discussed in political terms, the gendered implications and their effects on inclusive democracy and the representation of gender interests have been insufficiently explored. The paper proposes a conceptual framework to address the combined impact of declining gender equality policies and the emerging political space for feminist responses to this backsliding.

The authors illustrate this framework with case studies from three Central and Eastern European countries: Croatia, Hungary, and Poland. These examples demonstrate the challenges feminist movements face as they navigate hostile governments and shifting political environments, especially in illiberal democracies. The paper aims to enhance understanding of the gendered aspects of de-democratization and the evolving landscape for feminist engagement in such settings.

This publication is part of the UN Women’s broader discussion paper series and seeks to contribute to the literature on gender, democracy, and politics, focusing on how these dynamics are changing in light of recent political shifts."

LA Constitution Now Says There Is No Right to Abortion, Prepares for Dismantling of Roe By Jessica Lea - November 5, 2020 ShareTweetPinPocketFlipboard On Nov. 3, the state of Louisiana passed an amendment to its constitution explicitly saying it does not support any inherent right to abortion or funding for abortion. The amendment, which was sponsored by Democratic State Sen. Katrina Jackson, does not impact the legality of abortion or peoples access to it at present. But the amendment appears to be setting the state up to severely restrict access to abortions in the event Roe vs. Wade is overturned. This amendment makes sure there is no right to abortion or taxpayer funding of abortion in our state constitution, said Jackson. By passing this we can rest assured that, together with our state law, we will never become like New York, which recently legalized abortion up to the very moment before birth. Katrina Jacksons Love Life Amendment Passes Amendment 1, or the Love Life Amendment, adds one sentence to the Louisiana state constitution To protect human life, nothing in this constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion. Voters passed the amendment with 62.06 percent voting in favor of it and 37.94 percent voting against it. Not only was the amendment sponsored by Katrina Jackson, a pro-life Democratic state senator, but it also had the support of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. According to The Hill, Edwards is the only Democratic governor in the U.S. who opposes abortion. In an ad promoting the amendment, Jackson said, Sadly, in other states, judges have imposed their own will by recognizing a right to abortion and the government funding of abortion in their state constitutions. We want to ensure that doesnt happen in the state of Louisiana. By passing the Love Life Amendment, we will ensure that no judge can ever recognize a right to abortion or the state funding of abortion in Louisiana. We will ensure that unborn babies all across the state are protected on the day that Roe vs. Wade is overturned. The amendments website explains that the decision about whether there is a right to abortion in the state of Louisiana should reside in the states legislators and the voters who elect them, rather than in the states courts. The website says that to date, 13 other states have found a right to abortion in their constitutions, which has led to judges striking down pro-life laws and to the taxpayer funding of abortion. It is important to note that the amendment does not make abortion illegal if Roe vs. Wade were to be overturned. Should that happen, the legality of abortion would be determined by state legislators. What the amendment does is provide a basis for legislators to make abortion illegal if they had that opportunity and also gives extra protection to the pro-life laws Louisiana currently has in place. Some have said that the Love Life Amendment is merely a symbolic move and does not really accomplish anything. However, on its Instagram account, Love Life Vote Yes responded to someone who leveled this challenge, saying that the amendment is a defense mechanism that is very much needed while American court systems are consistently legislating from the judicial bench, usurping the legislative process, and forcing abortion-on-demand. In 13 other states, most recently Kansas, wrote the accounts moderator, judges have imposed a right to abortion and the taxpayer funding of abortion even though their state did not allow the funding or have the right to abortion in their state constitutionbecause there is a trend of judges usurping the legislative process and imposing the right to taxpayer funded abortions, we need to be proactive and prevent this from happening. Louisiana Baptist Convention Executive Director Steve Horn said that the passing of the amendment is an important statement from Louisiana voters. Weve been recognized by various groups to be the most pro-life state in the United States. I think this puts an exclamation point on that, and even some hard data, he said. The only other states right now to have added such language to their constitutions are West Virginia and Alabama. State Sen. Katrina Jackson has served in the Louisiana state legislature for nine years, the majority of that time in the House of Representatives. Jackson has spoken at the March for Life rally in Washington D.C. and has called abortion modern-day genocide. Jackson was also the author of a 2014 Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges in local hospitals. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down that law in June of this year. Colorado is another state that sought to limit abortion this election cyclethe state is one of seven that does not impose limits on abortion at any point during pregnancy. Proposition 115 would have banned abortions at 22 weeks with exceptions if the mothers life were at risk, but the measure failed to pass with 59 percent of constituents voting against it.

Sponsored by Democratic State Sen. Katrina Jackson, the amendment is designed to protect Louisiana from potential judicial rulings that could recognize abortion as a constitutional right, similar to what has occurred in 13 other states. While the amendment does not directly impact the legality of abortion, it prepares the state to restrict abortion access should Roe v. Wade be overturned.

The amendment’s supporters, including Governor John Bel Edwards, argue that it ensures Louisiana will not follow states like New York, where abortion is legalized up to birth. The amendment was passed with 62.06% of voters in favor, highlighting the state’s commitment to pro-life values. Jackson emphasized that the amendment is a defense against judicial overreach, where judges in other states have imposed abortion rights and funding, despite state constitutions not supporting them.

This amendment does not make abortion illegal, but it provides a legal foundation for the legislature to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Louisiana’s stance is seen as a proactive move to protect existing pro-life laws, reinforcing its position as one of the most pro-life states in the U.S. The passage of this amendment follows similar actions in West Virginia and Alabama."

Governments are assuming their obligations and duties under international, continental and regional commitments to respect, protect and fulfil the sexual and reproductive rights of adolescents and young people. A review of legal reforms, specifically around harmonizing laws and policies that affect the sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR of adolescents and young people, shows tremendous progress across the region and this is truly commendable. The UNFPA youth flagship programme - Safeguard Young People SYP, in collaboration with SADC, the SADC Parliamentary Forum and other partners, has been a powerful driver of this advancement. Together, with the leadership of governments, parliaments and policymakers, and in collaboration with young leaders, we have undertaken six years of sustained advocacy. A quick round-up of positive change shows that Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have used the SADC Model Law on child marriage to take critical steps towards eradicating this harmful practice and protecting adolescent girls. All four countries have domesticated the SADC Model Law on child marriage, while Mozambique used the Model Law in its new bill banning child marriage and setting the minimum age for marriage at 18. In Botswana, smart advocacy by young activists succeeded in advocating for the inclusion of the closein-age provision commonly known as the Romeo and Juliet law when the age of sexual consent went from 16 to 18 years, thus reducing the risk of criminalization of young people engaging in consensual sexual activity a factor that limits their right to access services and information on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. Malawi, South Africa and Uganda have set the minimum age of consent to HIV testing and counselling at 12 years without parental consent. This provision ensures that all adolescents are aware of their HIV status, enabling them to access treatment and care services.

This review highlights significant legal reforms and advances, largely driven by collaborations among governments, UNFPA, SADC, and other partners.

Key points include:
	1.	Legal Reforms and Progress: Several countries in East and Southern Africa have made notable strides in aligning their laws with international, regional, and continental commitments to protect adolescent sexual and reproductive rights.
	2.	Positive Changes:
	•	Child Marriage: Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe have domesticated the SADC Model Law on child marriage, which helps in eradicating this harmful practice and ensures that girls are protected. Mozambique also incorporated this Model Law in its bill to set the minimum marriage age at 18.
	•	Close-in-Age Provisions: In Botswana, young activists successfully advocated for the inclusion of the “Romeo and Juliet” law, which allows minors close in age to engage in consensual sex without facing criminal prosecution.
	•	HIV Testing: Malawi, South Africa, and Uganda have lowered the minimum age for HIV testing and counseling to 12 years, without requiring parental consent. This ensures adolescents can know their HIV status and access treatment and care services independently.
	3.	Advocacy and Collaboration: The progress in these legal reforms is attributed to sustained advocacy over six years, involving governments, parliaments, policymakers, and young leaders, with significant contributions from the UNFPA’s Safeguard Young People program.

In conclusion, the document emphasizes that these legal changes are critical in promoting sexual and reproductive health as a fundamental human right for adolescents and young people, showcasing substantial advancements in the region due to the combined efforts of various stakeholders."

YouTube""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon""Singer Jose Feliciano has expressed support for the pro-life movement, declaring that even if all there is is a heartbeat, thats life.Feliciano, who's blind and best known for his Christmas song Feliz Navidad, described his conversion to the pro-life movement in an interview with the National Catholic Register. I used to be pro-abortion many, many years ago, he recalled. But then when I had my daughter Melissa, I went the other way when I heard Melissas little heartbeat on the monitor, I said, Well, wait a minute. Even if all there is is a heartbeat, thats life.In addition to discussing his position on the issue of abortion, the 75-year-old Feliciano shared how his faith helped influence his career choice. When asked if God had a special plan for his life, he answered in the affirmative.Get Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get dailyweekly email with the top stories plus special offers! from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.SubscribeIt seemed to me that before my parents read the Bible or did other things with me, God was pushing me into the music area. God was showing me the light ever since I was born,"" he said. Somehow at that age when I would hear my uncles playing music in Puerto Rico, it seemed that God was sending me a message, that he was steering me in that direction.In one sight being blind helped because if I would have been sighted, I probably would have been playing stick ball in the streets and not listening to the message that God was giving which was music all the time, he added. Feliciano recalled that when his father gave him a harmonica at the age of 4, he quickly developed an ability to play tunes on it.My mother would go in the kitchen and sob uncontrollably because it really looked like a miracle. When she was crying, someone said, Listen, this has to be a sign from God, he recounted.Another person told Felicianos father, who was distraught about having a blind child, Dont worry about him being blind. You dont know what God has in store for him for the future. Looking back, Feliciano agrees, saying, Truer words were never spoken!Felicianos conversion on the issue of abortion is not unique. Many other celebrities and political figures have credited the availability of ultrasound technology as the source of their conversion from pro-choice to pro-life.Former Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, explained that he had a pro-choice position on abortion until 1995, when his wife was pregnant with his daughter. My wife and I went for a doctors appointment, and she was not showing at all at that point. And I heard that heartbeat really strong, he said.It turned it for me. On that ride home, I said my position is not justifiable. Thats a life, and I cannot countenance the taking of that life.The opportunity to view an ultrasound of an unborn baby transformed Abby Johnson from an employee of the year at Planned Parenthood to an outspoken pro-life activist. When she was asked to assist with an ultrasound-guided abortion of a 13-week old baby, she saw this baby fight for his life against the abortion instruments. She said that before seeing the ultrasound image of the abortion taking place, she believed that the unborn didnt have any sensory development, didnt feel anything.Was this article helpful?Yes0 VoteNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.25month50quarter100yearOne-timeNot this timeWere sorry to hear that.Hope youll give us another try and check out some other articles.

Initially pro-abortion, Feliciano’s perspective changed when he recognized that the heartbeat signified life. He also spoke about how his faith influenced his musical career, noting that God seemed to guide him toward music from an early age. Despite being blind, he found a connection to music through his family’s influence, and his early ability to play the harmonica was seen by his mother as a divine sign.

Feliciano’s shift to pro-life views mirrors those of other public figures, such as former Governor Chris Christie and Abby Johnson, whose conversions were sparked by ultrasound experiences revealing the humanity of unborn children."
A new challenge to Tennessee's abortion ban ‚Ä¢ Tennessee Lookout,"A new challenge to Tennessee's abortion ban Tennessee Lookout HOME NEWS Healthcare Education Environment Politics Immigration Investigates Cash for Clout Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 1743 Brief Legal The Look in Brief A new challenge to Tennessees abortion ban By Adam Friedman - September 12, 2023 543 pm Women at a Nashville protest for abortion rights on June 24, 2022. Photo John Partipilo Two doctors and three women filed a lawsuit against Tennessees abortion law, arguing it prevents the implementation of life-saving medical care. Pregnant people in Tennessee have suffered needless physical and emotional pain and harm, including loss of their fertility, said lawyers in suits filing documents. These pregnant people are not imagined. They are not ideological talking points. They are real people, many with children who depend upon them. Its the first challenge to Tennessees strict abortion ban since a narrow exception bill passed the State Legislature earlier this year. The exception law allows physicians to perform abortions in limited medical emergencies like molar or ectopic pregnancies to remove a miscarriage, save the mothers life or prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. The suit argues the exceptions passed arent clear enough, creating a pervasive fear and uncertainty throughout the medical community. Before the new legislation, Tennessee doctors could be charged with a felony for performing an abortion even if the mothers life was in danger, but they were allowed to argue the procedure was necessary as a defense in court. Tennessees abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the right to an abortion, allowing states to regulate the procedure. State Republican lawmakers passed an automatic trigger law in 2019 banning abortion if the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. The abortion lawsuit, filed Monday, is supported by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has filed similar cases in other states. The plaintiffs in the suit are Nicole Blackmon, Allyson Phillips, and Kaitlyn Dulong, and Drs. Heather Maune and Laura Andreson.

The plaintiffs argue that the law denies access to life-saving medical care, causing unnecessary physical and emotional harm, including infertility. This is the first challenge to the state’s abortion ban since the passage of a law allowing limited exceptions for medical emergencies such as ectopic pregnancies and the need to save the mother’s life. However, the lawsuit claims that these exceptions are unclear, creating fear and uncertainty within the medical community. Under the previous law, doctors could face felony charges for performing abortions, even if the mother’s life was at risk, though they could use the necessity of the procedure as a defense in court.

Tennessee’s abortion ban, triggered by the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in August 2022, was made possible by a 2019 law that automatically banned abortion if Roe was overturned. The lawsuit is supported by the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the plaintiffs include women who experienced pregnancy complications and doctors who wish to provide necessary medical care without the fear of legal repercussions. The case challenges the restrictive nature of Tennessee’s abortion laws and the lack of clarity around medical exceptions."

FRC will be hosting a Pro-Life Legislative Summit Saturday morning after the conference, an invitation sent to ALEC legislators and obtained by CMD reads.While the invite states the event is hosted by FRC and is not part of the ALEC conference, it was sent to ALEC members and asks recipients to Please wear your event badge. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated FRC as an anti-LGBTQ hate group.Its not the first time ALEC has cozied up to the hate group or other religious Right organizations. FRC hosted a Values Action Dinner at ALECs annual meeting in Utah last July, where the group promoted anti-trans legislation to ALEC legislators. ALEC has also provided space at its meeting for Alliance Defending Freedom, the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, and the National Pro-Life Womens Caucus.The event also fits into ALECs strategy of outsourcing access to its legislative members on controversial issues that could jeopardize the groups support from the corporations that bankroll its operations.Weve had a history of working on other issues like gun rights and social issues and things like that, which has not ended well for ALEC, said CEO Lisa Nelson at a Saving America Through the States action session at the 40th Anniversary May 2021 meeting of the Council for National Policy, a secretive, far-right Christian network. Because of our intersection of business and legislators we kind of stick to the fiscal issues.At that forum, State Sen. Jason Rapert R-Ark, an ALEC member, described how, We created the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, which is basically ALEC from a Biblical worldview to allow us to deal with those issues that Nelson said are not the direct mission of ALEC.Using the Texas Heartbeat Bill as a ModelDecembers FRC Pro-Life Legislative Summit for ALEC members featured Jonathan Mitchell, the author of the groundbreaking Texas Heartbeat Act, speaking on how states can respond to one of the most eagerly awaited Supreme Court cases Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization and see successful legislation like the Texas Heartbeat Act passed in your state.Joining Mitchell in addressing ALEC lawmakers were FRCs Senior Fellow for Biblical Worldview and Strategic Engagement Joseph Backholm Research Fellow for Legal and Policy Studies Katherine Johnson and Director of Federal Affairs Life and Human Dignity Connor Semelsberger.The Texas Heartbeat Act, or Texas Senate Bill 8, essentially bans abortions in the state at around six weeks of pregnancy or when fetal cardiac activity may be detected, even in cases where conception resulted from rape or incest. The reference to a heartbeat in the SB 8 is medically inaccurate, because an embryo does not have a developed heart at six weeks, and the beat is actually electrical impulses. The sound one hears is generated by the ultrasound machine.A divided Supreme Court used its shadow docket to allow the law to stand pending numerous legal challenges shortly before it went into effect on Aug. 31.Mitchell, a former solicitor general in Texas, is credited with coming up with the strategy that exploited legal loopholes that has allowed the law to stand by effectively outsourcing enforcement to private individuals. At least 12 states have versions of a heartbeat bill on the books that could go into effect if the landmark decision upholding abortion rights, Roe v. Wade, is overturned.Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, challenging Mississippis ban on abortion after 15 weeks, were heard in December, and a decision is expected from the nations highest court by June.Anti-abortion groups like FRC believe the case changes the trajectory of the pro-life movement because the Supreme Court is now firmly captured by the Right following Trumps appointment of justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.ALECs former national chair, Speaker Phillip Gunn R-MS, touted the case and its prospects for overturning Roe v. Wade during an ALEC panel at the CNP meeting last May, CMD reported. We think thats going to be a landmark case. All of us know that the United State Supreme Court composition has changed. We believe, in a way, that is more pro-life, Gunn told meeting attendees. They say that Amy Coney Barrett is one of the most active, pro-life people in America, so we believe that she brings a new dynamic to that court. We think our case, our law that we passed in 2018, will be transformative in the arena in abortion. Were proud of that.Utah State Senate President J. Stuart Adams, ALECs 2021 national chair, added that the Utah legislature copied Mississippis anti-abortion bill and joined with them in defending the Mississippi law.FRC Pushes its Agenda at ALEC SummitFRC circulated numerous papers at the ALEC meeting in December, obtained by CMD, promoting anti-abortion and anti-trans policies.In one paper, FRC argues against womens access to abortion, and another provides policy prescriptions to defund both abortions and abortion centers.Other policy papers argue for total abortion bans, legal protections for aborted fetuses, abortion pill bans, and other extremist policies.FRC also circulated a paper on anti-trans legislation, known as the Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act SAFE Act, that would ban gender-affirming medical treatments and hormone therapies for transgender youth.In one paper, FRC argues that these treatments violate the most fundamental principle of medical ethics First, do no harm.'FRCs Values Action Dinner at last years ALEC annual meeting featured Arkansas Rep. Robin Lundstrom, the bills primary sponsor in that state.Arkansass SAFE Act, enacted over the governors veto in April 2021, was blocked by a federal judge after the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit arguing that the law violates the U.S. Constitution.

This partnership, highlighted by a “Pro-Life Legislative Summit” held after ALEC’s December 2021 policy conference, exemplifies ALEC’s ties to far-right and religious organizations. Despite ALEC’s stated focus on business and fiscal issues, it has repeatedly allowed groups like FRC, the Alliance Defending Freedom, and others to promote their ideological agendas to ALEC’s legislative members. FRC’s summit, while not officially part of the ALEC conference, invited ALEC members and encouraged participation.

The article also highlights the FRC’s promotion of anti-abortion policies, including the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. ALEC members were provided with materials advocating for abortion bans, defunding abortion centers, and other restrictive policies. Additionally, FRC pushed anti-transgender legislation, notably the “Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act” (SAFE Act), which seeks to ban gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender youth.

ALEC’s involvement with these controversial issues, while focusing on non-business-related topics, risks alienating corporate sponsors and creating potential backlash from more moderate supporters. The article portrays ALEC’s actions as part of a broader strategy to shape policy through partnerships with powerful conservative groups, despite potential reputational risks."

He heard a voice from the front porch yell, FBI! Open up! and saw unmarked cars with flashing lights through the window. The banging resumed on the front door. He said he pulled back the curtain of the glass door and saw FBI agents with their guns drawn. At first, he thought they had come there by mistake, he said. But when the agents told him they were looking for him, almost immediately, Im like, Well, theres only one reason theyd be looking for me. Its gotta be pro-life related. Vaughn said once the agents secured him in their vehicle, they opened up a laptop and showed him a document. He had to squint to read it without his glasses, but Vaughn could make out his name and the acronym FACE. Vaughn, a 55-year-old father of 11, is one of 11 pro-lifers the U.S. government charged this month with violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances FACE Act. The charges stem from a protest in March 2021, when pro-lifers blocked the hallway to a Mount Juliet, Tenn., abortion facility suite inside of a medical building. Congress passed the FACE Act in 1994 to stem blockades of abortion facilities and increasing violence against abortion facility staff. The Department of Justice claims that the 11 pro-lifers in Tennessee used force and physical obstruction to injure, intimidate, and interfere with facility patients and staff. A growing list of activists have faced similar federal charges this year for their involvement in peaceful pro-life demonstrations. The increasing crackdowns worry pro-lifers, who wonder if they will be next. In September, Franciscan friar Christopher Moscinski received FACE charges for padlocking the gated entrance of a New York abortion facility and later using his body to block the driveway. The next week, the government charged Pennsylvania pro-lifer Mark Houck under FACE, citing an October 2021 altercation between him and a volunteer escort at a Philadelphia abortion facility. Back in March, the Department of Justice charged nine pro-lifers under FACE for an October 2020 sit-in at a Washington, D.C., abortion facility. And on Friday, a federal grand jury charged a 10th pro-lifer for helping to plan that same sit-in. In the Mount Juliet case, Vaughn and six others face charges of conspiracy against rights secured by the FACE Act. Vaughns attorney, Thomas More Society senior counsel Steve Crampton, said normally a first-time FACE offender like Vaughn would receive misdemeanor charges punishable by one year in prison and a maximum fine of 10,000. But the added charge of conspiracy increases the potential penalty to 11 years imprisonment and fines of up to 250,000. According to the Justice Department, Vaughn and his co-conspirators used social media to coordinate travel and to find others who would join the demonstration, conspiring against peoples rights to obtain and perform abortions. The charge represents a major escalation in punishmentfor Vaughn especially. According to local news coverage from the 2021 sit-in, Mount Juliet law enforcement arrested and charged only nine adults at the protest with criminal trespassing. Vaughn and one other defendant in the FACE case were not arrested. I intentionally, very methodically, very intentionally tried to stay on the right side of every law I was aware of and do everything right, said Vaughn. He said his 11th child was due to be born at about the same time as that sit-in, so he decided not to risk arrest. Although a video of the sit-in shows Vaughn took part in the demonstration and had several lengthy conversations with police officers, he complied with the police when they gave their final warnings. Now he faces the possibility of more than a decade in prison. Calvin Zastrow is a 57-year-old Michigan resident who has been participating in pro-life demonstrations at abortion facilities for more than 30 years. He attended the Mount Julie protest and was arrested. Video taken during the demonstration shows him sitting in front of a door while an abortion facility worker attempts to unlock it and tells him to move. He quietly replies, No, maam, and tells her of the forgiveness she can have in Jesus Christ. Another of the nine arrested was Eva Edl, an 87-year-old German survivor of a communist concentration camp in Yugoslavia. Edl is confined to a wheelchair. Law enforcement also arrested Zastrows adult children James and Eva. Local officials charged them with criminal trespassing. Both now have misdemeanor charges under FACE. Video shows them sitting and standing in front of another door, singing hymns, praying, and listening to other pro-lifers read Scripture during the sit-in. Zastrow said he found out about the federal charges while doing mission work in Ukraine. A fellow pro-lifer told him about Vaughns arrest by the FBI, so Zastrow warned his wife that agents might stop by their Michigan home. But Zastrow said later that the FBI never came to his home. Instead, an agent called him on his cellphone and politely designated a time for Zastrow to come to court for his arraignment the next week. No one was waiting to arrest him at the airport when he landed in Chicago. He said he showed up in court on Wednesday, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him, and received instructions to show up for a bond hearing in Tennessee in two days. Local prosecutors dropped the trespassing charges against three of the pro-lifers, including James Zastrow. His father said James accepted a plea bargain and a fine. But the six ongoing local trespassing cases have not made it to trial in Tennessees Wilson County Criminal Court. Attorney Daniel Turklay represents Zastrow, his daughter, and four other pro-lifers. He said the federal FACE charges surprised him. Its not a crime for profit. Theres no violence here. Theres no theft here . In this local case, its a relatively noncontroversial trespassing issue, Turklay said. This is truly something that is for the benefit of others, as opposed to for the benefit of themselves, which is a typical criminal case. The next pretrial hearing is not scheduled until Jan. 9, just shy of two years after the demonstration occurred. Zastrow also faces charges in Grand Rapids, Mich., related to a sit-in this past summer. He was among six people arrested for blocking the driveway of an abortion facility a few weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Attorney Robert Dunn, arguing on behalf of five of the pro-lifers Zastrow chose to represent himself in the case, asked the judge to instruct the eventual jury that if they found the defendants acted with the reasonable belief that they were protecting human life, they should find them not guilty. An attorney representing the city argued instead that the pro-lifers had no proof that an abortion was about to be performed and therefore could not argue they were defending others. The judge ultimately turned down Dunns motion, siding with the city attorney. Jury selection in the case is scheduled for Oct. 27. Derek Anderson, one of the pro-lifers charged with trespassing, said he wouldnt be surprised if the FBI started investigating this Grand Rapids case for possible FACE charges. Theres always a looming, like, what are they going to try? he said. Because the FBI and the Department of Justice are weaponized against this issue.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","The article discusses the escalating federal charges against pro-life activists under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. This law, passed in 1994, was designed to prevent blockades and violence at abortion facilities. However, several pro-life activists are now facing federal prosecution for nonviolent protests, which includes blocking entrances or engaging in sit-ins at abortion clinics.

The article highlights the case of Paul Vaughn, a father of 11, who was charged in connection with a 2021 protest at an abortion facility in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The charges include conspiracy to obstruct access to an abortion clinic, a federal crime that carries harsher penalties compared to misdemeanor charges typically associated with trespassing. Vaughn, despite his active participation, avoided arrest at the time but is now facing serious charges due to his role in organizing the protest.

Other activists, like Calvin Zastrow, a 57-year-old Michigan pro-life advocate, and Eva Edl, an 87-year-old concentration camp survivor, also face similar charges for their roles in protests. These charges stem from their nonviolent actions at abortion clinics, and the activists argue that their actions are not criminal but motivated by their religious beliefs and desire to protect unborn lives.

The article underscores the growing concerns within the pro-life community about potential repercussions for future demonstrations, as more activists face federal charges for similar acts of civil disobedience. Some legal experts and attorneys defending these pro-lifers argue that their actions are based on religious convictions and are not violent or motivated by personal gain, suggesting that these charges represent an overreach by the federal government."

UNFPA Yemen 04 October 2020 SANAA, Yemen In mid-May, just as the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Yemen, funding for UNFPAs life-saving reproductive health services dried up. UNFPA was forced to suspend the provision of reproductive health care in 140 out of 180 health facilities. The consequences have been catastrophic, particularly for pregnant women and girls. Health workers around the country recounted heart-breaking instances of preventable maternal deaths taking place after care became unavailable. Since then, with limited funding coming in, UNFPA has been able to resume operations in some key health facilities across the country. Womens lives were immediately saved. Lives saved Al-Shael Health Centre in Hajjah Governorate was able to resume reproductive health services in July with funding from the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid, after shuttering these services earlier in the year. A newborn at a health facility in Taizz. Resumed services are saving lives in key areas. UNFPA YemenThe reopening saved Eltafs life. She had been ready give birth at home when she started to experience severe bleeding. When Eltaf arrived at the Al-Shael Health Centre, she was in a critical condition, said Dr. Eshraq, the gynaecologist at the health centre. Even though reproductive care had resumed at the centre, serious complications are usually referred to larger hospitals. Yet there was no time, Dr. Eshraq explained. I was afraid that she and her baby would die. They were able to stop the haemorrhaging. Then we helped to deliver her baby, who was suffering from asphyxia, she said. It is like a miracle that we saved Eltaf and her baby with the resources we have. I am proud of my team midwife Huda and nurse Raya. Abandoned no more In Socotra, with funding from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, UNFPA has been able to support reproductive health services at two health facilities. One is the Nawjad Health Centre, which was non-functional last year, leaving women on the island without any reproductive health services. When Noor, now 20, experienced complications in her pregnancy, she had to travel hundreds of miles to give birth at a health facility in a faraway city. By the time she arrived, it was too late. She lost the baby. This year, she became pregnant again. But this time, she was able to visit the Nawjad Health Centre to deliver under the care of a midwife, free of charge. She had a healthy baby boy. I am happy to come to this health centre. If it was not here, we would have to make the long journey again to the city, Noors husband said. It would have cost me 60,000 Yemen Riyal. This health centre was abandoned for a long time. We did not receive any pregnant women, said centres director. But these days, it has become a lifeline for many women in Socotra. A health worker attends to a woman in labour. But many areas are still without reproductive health services. UNFPA YemenFunds still scraping bottom Despite these recent re-openings, some 70 per cent of UNFPAs reproductive health programmes in the country remain closed due to the lack of funding. Only 61 out of 180 UNFPA-supported reproductive health facilities are functioning. By this time last year, UNFPA had supported 265 health facilities and 3,800 reproductive health workers, reaching over 2 million women and girls with reproductive health services. Today, an estimated 1.5 million women of childbearing age are no longer receiving reproductive health services because of the funding shortage. Yet the need for this care has never been greater. UNFPA estimates that approximately 6 million women and girls of childbearing age in Yemen need access to reproductive health care. More than a million pregnant women are malnourished. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming the countrys health system, escalating the vulnerabilities of women and girls. To keep reaching the most vulnerable women and girls up to the end of the year, UNFPA urgently requires 38.7 million, with an additional 20 million to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This crisis had devastating consequences, particularly for pregnant women and girls, resulting in preventable maternal deaths.

However, with limited funding, UNFPA has managed to resume services in key health centers, saving lives. For example, the Al-Shael Health Centre in Hajjah Governorate, supported by the European Union, was able to resume operations in July, directly saving the life of a woman, Eltaf, who faced life-threatening complications during childbirth. In Socotra, funding from the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre enabled the reopening of the Nawjad Health Centre, which had previously been abandoned. This allowed Noor, a woman who had lost a child in the past due to lack of accessible care, to safely deliver a healthy baby this year.

Despite these successes, the funding shortage remains critical, with about 70% of UNFPA’s reproductive health programs still suspended. Currently, only 61 of 180 supported facilities are operational, and approximately 1.5 million women are without access to essential reproductive health services. The need for care is urgent, as around 6 million women and girls in Yemen require reproductive health services, and many are facing malnutrition and COVID-19-related vulnerabilities. To continue supporting vulnerable populations, UNFPA urgently needs $38.7 million, with an additional $20 million for the pandemic response."

Darin OswaldIdaho Statesman via AP,File By Lisa Baumann Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print A rural hospital in northern Idaho will stop delivering babies or providing other obstetrical care, citing a shifting legal climate in which recently enacted state laws could subject physicians to prosecution for providing abortions, among other reasons.Bonner General Health in Sandpoint will discontinue obstetrical services in mid-May. It also cited a decreasing number of deliveries and a loss of doctors among other factors in its decision.Those pregnant in the city of about 9,000 with an average annual snowfall of about 60 inches 150 centimeters will most likely have to travel about 45 miles 70 kilometers to Coeur dAlene for care, or to hospitals farther away in Idaho, Washington and Montana.The decision to discontinue providing obstetrical services was emotional and difficult, hospital officials said in a news release. We have made every effort to avoid eliminating these services, Ford Elsaesser, Bonner General Healths Board president, said in the release. We hoped to be the exception, but our challenges are impossible to overcome now. The numbers of deliveries had been declining for years with 265 births recorded at the hospital in 2022, the statement said. Births also have been decreasing nationally and older people have been moving into the Sandpoint area, officials said.

After the United States Supreme Court stripped away constitutional protections for abortion last year, Idaho banned nearly all abortions in measures that subject physicians to prosecution for providing any abortions, even if needed to protect the health of a pregnant patient. The Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care, the hospital statement said. Consequences for Idaho physicians providing the standard of care may include civil litigation and criminal prosecution, leading to jail time or fines. Physicians could face felony charges and a medical license revocation for violating the law, which the Idaho Supreme Court determined earlier this year is constitutional. A federal judge has stopped Idaho from enforcing the ban in medical emergencies at Medicare-funded facilities.Highly respected, talented physicians are leaving, according to Bonner hospital officials, who said recruiting replacements would be extraordinarily difficult.Dr. Amelia Huntsberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Bonner General Hospital, moved to Sandpoint in 2012 to work in the area, according to a court filing last year supporting an effort to halt the abortion ban.She told the Idaho Capital Sun in Boise by email that she will leave the hospital and the state because of the abortion laws and because of the Idaho Legislatures decision to discontinue the states maternal mortality review committee. For rural patients in particular, delaying medical care until we can say an abortion is necessary to prevent death is dangerous, she said in her court filing. Patients will suffer pain, complications, and could die if physicians comply with Idaho law as written. Huntsberger could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press and messages left for her with a hospital spokeswoman were not returned.Leandra Wright told KREM-TV that after having a baby at Bonner General Health in 2020 she had been looking forward to the birth of her son there in August.Wright, who lives in the nearby town of Sagle, said she learned about the hospitals decision from a Facebook post.Its nerve-wracking and stressful and my stomach just kind of drops, Wright said. Now I have to reestablish with another place and I have to drive to have my baby.Officials at Kootenai Health in Coeur dAlene said in a Facebook post that anyone who would have given birth at Bonner General Health can go to Kootenai Healths Family Birth Center, where about 2,200 babies are born each year.Leadership from both hospitals are working together to identify any barriers to care for the patient population affected by this closure and are creating solutions to ensure a quality birth experience, the post said.Associated Press writer Claire Rush in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.","A rural hospital in Sandpoint, Idaho, announced that it will stop offering obstetrical services, including delivering babies, due to a combination of factors. Key reasons include Idaho’s restrictive abortion laws, which could subject physicians to prosecution for providing necessary medical care, such as abortion. These laws, passed following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion even when necessary for the health of the patient. As a result, Bonner General Health cited the risk of civil and criminal penalties for physicians who provide care deemed standard in the medical community.

The hospital also faced challenges such as a declining birth rate, with only 265 deliveries recorded in 2022, and difficulty in recruiting doctors, particularly in a region with a rapidly aging population. The hospital’s decision was described as emotional, with officials stating that they had tried to avoid eliminating these services, but the legal and political climate made it untenable.

Patients in the Sandpoint area will now need to travel to other hospitals in nearby cities like Coeur d’Alene, which is about 45 miles away, or further destinations in Idaho, Washington, or Montana. Bonner General Health’s closure highlights the broader issue of physician shortages and the potential impact of restrictive laws on healthcare access, especially in rural areas."
Blue States Enact New Laws to Create Abortion Havens ‚Ä¢ Stateline,"Blue States Enact New Laws to Create Abortion Havens Stateline HOME NEWS Health care Education Environment Society Criminal Justice Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 000 News Story Abortion accessHealth Blue States Enact New Laws to Create Abortion Havens By Christine Vestal - April 1, 2022 1200 am Democratic Assemblymember Cristina Garcia discusses Californias efforts to strengthen womens reproductive rights. Nationwide, states that ensure the right to abortion are preparing to help people from states that ban it. Rich PedroncelliThe Associated Press If the U.S. Supreme Court decides in June, as expected, that all states can limit abortions to the earliest stages of pregnancy or ban the procedure altogether, hundreds of thousands of Americans are likely to start traveling to states where abortion remains legal. In preparation, lawmakers in those states are considering bills that would remove hurdles such as waiting periods and parental notifications, and some are proposing to help low-income patients by paying for travel and other practical expenses that add to the true cost of abortion care. Abortion providers and rights advocates also are urging states to remove barriers both to telehealth and to medication abortion, expand Medicaid coverage of the procedure, ensure the privacy of patients, protect providers from potential lawsuits from other states and invest in training and facilities for abortion providers. They want to ensure adequate capacity for what likely will be a surge of abortion refugees in some parts of the country. If lawmakers address barriers to abortion for people in need, who are most impacted by strict state abortion laws, theyll address barriers for everyone, no matter where they come from, said Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, which assists and advises state policymakers. Nearly three-quarters of people receiving an abortion in the United States are living in poverty, according to 2014 data from abortion advocacy and research group the Guttmacher Institute. And in 2019, 38 of abortion patients were Black, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. But the percentage of people receiving an abortion who were Black was substantially higher in Mississippi 74, Georgia 65, Alabama 62 and other Southern states with strict abortion bans. Abortion Patchwork If the Supreme Court weakens or jettisons its 1973 abortion rights ruling, 26 states are expected to ban or severely restrict the procedure, according to Guttmacher. Abortion rights are considered protected for the long term in the District of Columbia and 15 states California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, which enshrine the right to abortion in state law, according to Guttmacher. Two other states may soon join that list. The Colorado legislature this month passed a bill that, once signed by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who supports the measure, would codify the right to abortion. And New Mexico, where an old abortion ban was repealed last year, is widely expected to be the next state to enshrine abortion rights in state law. Lawmakers in many of those states already have experienced an influx of pregnant people from outside their borders over the past five years as a record number of GOP-led states enacted ever stricter abortion bans. Many blue states are considering new measures that would accommodate even greater demand for abortion in a post-Roe environment. Backed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who last year signed a bill protecting the privacy of people who receive abortions, lawmakers in the state have proposed a dozen abortion bills this session designed to address racial and economic inequities in abortion access and boost the states capacity to serve both residents and visitors as quickly as possible. Legislation also is moving through statehouses in more than a dozen other states that would make it easier for residents and people from out of state to receive an abortion. In the past three years since 2019, weve seen the most action to protect abortion rights and increase access that weve ever seen, said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate at Guttmacher. What were seeing is blue states reacting to an onslaught of conservative state abortion bans and a solidly anti-abortion Supreme Court. This is a direct reaction to all of that. California Leads Last week, Newsom signed a bill that will require private insurers and the states low-income Medicaid health plan to pay the full cost of abortion with no copays or deductibles. The new law is one of a dozen bills proposed by California legislators this session aimed at supporting more equitable access to abortion care. The package of bills, sponsored by the California Legislative Womens Caucus and other top legislative leaders, is based on 45 recommendations for expanding access to abortion for state residents and those living elsewhere outlined in a December report from an advisory council convened by the governor. Were talking about being a refuge for anyone in the United States who wants to come to California, Assemblymember Cristina Garcia, who chairs the caucus, said in an interview with Stateline. But the package of bills also aims to shore up access here in California and improve reproductive justice, making abortion accessible to our most marginalized community members. Beyond California, bills aimed at boosting access to abortion are under consideration in more than a dozen states, the largest number of proposals in any legislative period in history, Nash said. With roughly two months left before most legislative sessions adjourn, lawmakers are pushing hard in an election year to pass abortion access legislation. In addition to Californias insurance coverage bill, Colorados abortion rights bill and a New Jersey abortion rights bill signed in January by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, bills in three other states have been approved. Marylands General Assembly this week passed an abortion protection bill, marking the first time in three decades the legislature approved a measure aimed at expanding abortion access statewide, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., wrote in a news release. The bill, which is headed to Republican Gov. Larry Hogans desk, would ensure private insurance covers the procedure without cost-sharing, expand Medicaid coverage of the procedure, appropriate 3.5 million for medical professionals who want to train in abortion care and allow not just physicians but also advanced practice nurses and physician assistants to perform abortions. Hogan has not said whether he will sign the bill, but it received strong support among Democratic lawmakers, who hold a veto-proof majority in the Maryland General Assembly. In March, Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill prohibiting the state from taking legal action against people seeking an abortion and those who assist them, to ward off any attempts to enact a Texas-style abortion ban that calls on private citizens to sue anyone suspected of aiding an abortion. And the Oregon legislature approved million in state funds to help abortion providers buy equipment and expand their workforce. The money also is slated to fund a hotline for patients seeking abortions in the state and to pay for travel and other expenses associated with an abortion. Both the Washington and Oregon measures came in response to anticipated demand from people in Idaho seeking abortions after the Republican legislature passed a Texas-style abortion ban in March, prohibiting the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, before many patients know theyre pregnant. Legal Protections California and Connecticut are the only states considering bills that would protect resident abortion providers from lawsuits filed by officials in other states where abortion is illegal. Thats a big gap that other states need to fill, David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University School of Law, said in an interview. In a soon-to-be-published paper, he outlines the risks to abortion providers and the steps states can take to protect them. To protect patients, providers and anyone who assists them, Cohen suggests, states should enact laws that block law enforcement agencies from cooperating with civil or criminal out-of-state investigations related to the legal provision of abortion in their states. He and his co-authors Greer Donley and Rachel Rebouch also suggest that states where abortion remains legal can instruct their medical boards and in-state malpractice insurance companies to abstain from taking any adverse action against providers who give out-of-state patients abortions that are legal in the providers state. Cohen pointed to a provision in a bill proposed this year in Missouri that would make it illegal for a Missouri resident to seek an abortion in another state. He said Missouri is not likely to be the last state to try to do that.

These measures aim to remove barriers like waiting periods, parental notifications, and restrictions on telehealth or medication abortion. They also seek to address financial barriers by funding travel and other expenses for low-income patients.

Approximately 26 states are expected to ban or severely restrict abortion if the Court weakens or overturns Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, states like California, New York, and Washington have enacted or are proposing new laws to protect abortion rights and expand access, both for residents and people traveling from other states. California has been at the forefront, with Governor Gavin Newsom supporting a set of laws aimed at ensuring equity in abortion care and accommodating a likely influx of out-of-state patients. These include insurance coverage for the full cost of abortion, no copays or deductibles, and additional funding for providers.

Other states, including Colorado, Maryland, and Oregon, have also introduced or passed legislation that expands abortion access and funding. Some measures, like those in Oregon, also address the expected surge in patients from neighboring states with stricter laws. Washington has moved to protect abortion providers from legal action, reflecting concerns about potential lawsuits from states with anti-abortion laws.

Legal protections for abortion providers are a key issue, with California and Connecticut leading efforts to shield them from lawsuits originating in states where abortion is illegal. Experts suggest that other states need to adopt similar protections, as some conservative states may attempt to restrict travel for abortions.

In response to the likely rise in demand, blue states are increasingly positioning themselves as safe havens for abortion access, with a strong focus on making services more equitable and accessible."

AP More than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, the issue has at times dominated the discussion among the Republicans seeking their partys 2024 presidential nomination and is sure to be on display during the first GOP campaign debate Wednesday in Milwaukee.Some of the division among the candidates has come over whether there should be a national ban on the practice and after how many weeks now that the justices have returned specific debate over abortion legality to the states.A look at how the issue of abortion is playing out among Republican and Democratic candidatesREPUBLICANS DONALD TRUMPThe former president, the current GOP front-runner, has often sidestepped the issue of abortion, even as Republicans across the country have celebrated the Supreme Courts decision.In April, a major anti-abortion group assailed Trump on the issue, saying his contention that abortion restrictions should be left up to individual states, not the federal government, is a morally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate. The Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America group has said it would not support any White House candidate who did not at a minimum support a 15-week federal abortion ban.Trump, who has referred to himself as the most pro-life president in American history, has pointed to his successful nomination of three conservatives justices, a move that tilted the court to the conservative majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. Earlier this year, he characterized as too harsh a measure signed into law by fellow contender Gov. Ron DeSantis that would ban abortions in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy. MORE 2024 ELECTION COVERAGE No Labels movement says it could offer independent presidential ticket in 2024 Should Trump go to jail? The 2024 election could become a referendum on that question Joe Biden, Americas oldest sitting president, needs young voters to win again. Will his age matter? RON DESANTIS While DeSantis has been governor, Florida passed an abortion ban after six weeks of pregnancy. But DeSantis, who says he is pro-life, has suggested that individual states should decide the issue, adding in a recent interview that he is running on doing things that I know I can accomplish. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, criticized DeSantis for not supporting a national ban on the procedure, calling DeSantis position unacceptable as he runs for president. MIKE PENCEThe former vice president supports a federal ban on abortion at six weeks, before many women even know theyre pregnant. And he has advocated pulling from the market one of two widely used abortion pills a medication with a better safety record than Viagra and penicillin. Sensing that such a position may be viewed as too extreme in a general election, no other major presidential candidate has joined his calls.In a recent Associated Press interview, Pence went even further, saying abortion should be banned, even when a pregnancy is deemed nonviable. Such a standard would force women to carry pregnancies to term even when doctors have determined there is no chance a baby will survive outside the womb.Earlier this month while touring the Iowa State Fair, Pence said he was expecting to use the debate as an opportunity to call out Trump and DeSantis for not insisting on a national abortion ban. TIM SCOTTThe South Carolina senator has long voiced his opposition to abortion, pledging that as president I would sign the most conservative pro-life legislation you can bring to my desk.He has signaled support for a federal ban on the practice for as early as 12 weeks and also support for a bill sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that would ban abortions nationally after 15 weeks.In 2021, Scott also co-sponsored legislation that would have established a constitutional right to life from the moment of fertilization. NIKKI HALEYHaley, the sole woman in the GOP field, pledged in May that she would sign a federal abortion ban if elected president.But Haley has not specified a time frame for after how many weeks she feels abortion should be outlawed, noting that passing such a measure would be highly unlikely without more Republicans in Congress, and advocating for consensus around the issue. Shes said she would absolutely sign a 15-week federal ban. The former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said no one has been honest about how difficult a ban could be to achieve, in a closely divided federal government.Haley campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said in June that she would sign pro-life legislation that includes exceptions for rape, incest, and for the life of the mother, suggesting she may be opposed to an exception for non-viable pregnancies but declining to clarify.As governor, Haley signed an abortion ban after about 20 weeks. That law is still in effect while a six-week ban, passed by state lawmakers, is held up in the courts. Ohio voters have resoundingly rejected a Republican-backed measure that would have made it more difficult to pass abortion protections. Aug. 9 VIVEK RAMASWAMYThe wealthy biotech entrepreneur and author of Woke, Inc. has said he would not support a federal ban on abortion because the federal government should stay out of it. He has voiced support for states that have passed six-week bans. Like some other hopefuls, he has pushed for more policies that encourage adoption and better child care. CHRIS CHRISTIEThe former two-term New Jersey governor has argued that the issue of abortion should be carried out in the states, not at the federal level. In a CNN town hall, Christie said that the federal government should not be involved unless and until theres a consensus around the country from the 50 states making their own decisions about what it should be.Seeking local office in the 1990s, Christie identified himself as pro-choice, saying he changed his position after hearing his daughters heartbeat at 13 weeks.As governor, he vetoed millions in state funding for Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics. Before the Supreme Courts decision that overturned Roe, Christie joined Dannenfelser in meetings other GOP governors to discuss the issue and how it might play out at the state level. ASA HUTCHINSONThe former two-term Arkansas governor has said the issue of abortion should stay in the states without a Republican supermajority in Congress.As governor in 2021, Hutchinson signed a near-total ban on abortions that did not include rape and incest exceptions. DOUG BURGUMIn April, the two-term North Dakota governor signed one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country. The measure would allow abortions up to six weeks gestation in cases of rape or incest, or medical emergencies. After that marker, no exceptions aside from some medical emergencies, such as ectopic pregnancies, are allowed at any stage of pregnancy.Burgum has mostly said the issue of abortion should be left to the states and has indicated he would not support a federal ban. LARRY ELDERThe conservative talk radio host opposes abortion but has said he would not support a federal ban. PERRY JOHNSONThe businessman describes himself as pro-life. When he ran for Michigan governor in 2022, Johnson told reporters two wrongs dont make a right when asked if he would rule out banning abortion in cases of sexual assault. FRANCIS SUAREZThe Miami mayor has said that he would support a national ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions, including rape, incest and the mothers health. WILL HURDThe former Texas congressman has said he would sign a 15-week federal abortion ban, although he has said that he doesnt see it as realistic that Congress would pass such a measure.While in the House, Hurd twice voted in favor of a 20-week ban.DEMOCRATS JOE BIDENThe president supports abortion access and has said he would veto a national ban on the practice. As a senator, Biden supported abortion restrictions like the 1976 Hyde Amendment which states that Medicaid wont pay for abortions unless the womans life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest but said during the 2020 campaign he had shifted course.The aftermath of last years Supreme Court ruling has framed much of Bidens presidency on abortion. He signed an executive order designed to strengthen and promote access to contraception. Mounting a rallying cry to 2022 midterms voters to seat more Democratic lawmakers who could possibly codify abortion access nationally, Biden has also directed his administration to take steps to protect access to abortion care. This includes making mifepristone one of two pills used in medication abortions easier to obtain, and ensuring members of the military can access reproductive health care. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.The author and environmental lawyer has spoken in favor of bodily autonomy and describes himself as pro-choice.A nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, he has also said its a womans choice, and its solely up to the woman in terms of how a pregnancy should be handled in its first trimester. MARIANNE WILLIAMSONThe self-help authors campaign website describes her as one hundred percent pro-choice. Williamson has also noted that she believes the decision to have an abortion or not lies solely with a pregnant woman, according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding.Meg Kinnard can be reached at MEG KINNARD Kinnard covers national politics for The Associated Press. She lives in South Carolina. mailto","The 2024 U.S. presidential candidates have differing views on abortion, which have become a key issue following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Here’s where some of the major candidates stand:

Republicans:
	•	Donald Trump: While often avoiding the issue, Trump supports leaving abortion decisions to individual states and has faced criticism for not supporting a national ban. He has also distanced himself from Florida’s six-week abortion ban.
	•	Ron DeSantis: As Florida’s governor, he signed a law banning abortions after six weeks and supports states making their own abortion laws, although some pro-life groups have pushed him for a national ban.
	•	Mike Pence: Advocates for a strict national ban at six weeks and opposes exceptions for nonviable pregnancies.
	•	Tim Scott: Supports a national ban on abortions after 12 weeks and co-sponsored legislation for a constitutional right to life from fertilization.
	•	Nikki Haley: Pledges to sign a federal abortion ban but emphasizes the need for consensus. She supports a 15-week ban and has signed a state-level ban in South Carolina.
	•	Vivek Ramaswamy: Opposes a federal ban, advocating for states’ rights to decide on abortion policies.
	•	Chris Christie: Believes abortion decisions should be handled at the state level, though his views have evolved over time.
	•	Asa Hutchinson: Supports leaving abortion decisions to states and signed a near-total ban in Arkansas without exceptions for rape and incest.
	•	Doug Burgum: Signed a strict anti-abortion law in North Dakota, with some exceptions for rape and incest, and believes states should manage abortion laws.
	•	Larry Elder: Opposes abortion but does not support a federal ban.
	•	Francis Suarez: Supports a national 15-week abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, and health reasons.
	•	Will Hurd: Supports a 15-week national ban but sees it as unrealistic at the federal level.

Democrats:
	•	Joe Biden: Strongly supports abortion access and has pledged to veto any national abortion ban. He has also taken actions to protect abortion access, including facilitating access to medication abortions and reproductive health care for military personnel.
	•	Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Advocates for bodily autonomy and supports a woman’s right to choose, especially in the first trimester.
	•	Marianne Williamson: Strongly pro-choice, emphasizing that the decision to have an abortion should be made by the woman in consultation with her conscience and spiritual beliefs.

The debate over abortion remains central to the 2024 election, with Republicans divided on whether there should be a national ban and what exceptions should apply, while Democrats advocate for broader access to abortion rights."

The woman, known throughout the ordeal by her pseudonym Anna, had worked for a decade at a company that manufactured plates used in printing presses for candy wrappers. In 2017, she was legally recognized as a woman, and then fired. The grounds? That the Russian government had banned women from doing that job. Rooted in 1970s Soviet propaganda that said women need protection from dangerous jobs to preserve their fertility, a regulation passed by the government of President Vladimir Putin in 2000 confirmed a prohibition on women working in 456 professions. These include train or truck drivers and auto mechanics. Russian women have fought the law, including in a 2012 landmark case, when a woman who had studied nautical navigation was accepted for a job as a riverboat captain, then rejected a few weeks later, referencing the ban on women in the profession. She had never heard of the regulation before and had invested in her education for this profession. Russian courts fumbled the case, but in 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women ruled in her favor, rebuked the Russian government for its baseless appeal to protecting womens fertility, and recommended reviewing and amending the list of banned professions. In July 2019, following that lawsuit and UN appeal, and an alljobs4allwomen campaign by leading human rights groups, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection announced that it had shortened the list to 100 restricted professions. The reduced list will come into effect in January. Starting next year, Russian women will be legally allowed to drive trains and trucks and fix cars. But the revised list still says women are restricted from working in jobs in the chemical industry, metallurgy, oil production, coal mining, manufacturing of insulation, and some others owing to the harmful effects of certain compounds on womens reproductive health. Annas recently concluded case illustrates the absurdity of the list, and the arbitrariness with which it is inflicted on Russian women. It also reduces women to their reproductive functions and perpetuates traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Anna began transitioning in 2015 and fought to align the name on her ID card with her gender identity, replacing the male name given to her at birth. A battle to change her gender marker on her ID ensued. But success in changing her legal gender in 2017 quickly led to her termination. Anna immediately filed a discrimination lawsuit, but lost. With the help of Vyhod Coming Out, a Russian LGBT rights group, she appealed to a city court but lost again. In December 2018, the city courts presidium declared the earlier rulings void and sent Annas case for a retrial. In April 2019, she won, and the court ordered 10,000 rubles US144 in compensation for moral damages and 1.85 million rubles in compensation for forced absenteeism. In April 2020, her former employers appeal was rejected and the compensation ruling upheld at last. Max Olenichev, legal adviser at Vyhod who helped on Annas case, said the courts final decision was an important signal that transgender people in Russia could seek justice through the courts, but also sent a strong message about gender equality more broadly. Every woman has the right to choose a profession, Olenichev said. The absolute prohibition on such a choice, established in Russia by a list of professions prohibited for women, is a manifestation of discrimination. Instead of limiting womens access to employment, the Russian government should focus on ensuring that workplaces are safe and free of abuse and discrimination for everyone. Annas employer never challenged her capacity to perform her job before she legally changed her gender. Then they used Russias pernicious and discriminatory law to fire her. Instead of misusing the law to keep women out of certain professions, Russian authorities should focus their attention on gender based discrimination like the wage gaps women in Russia face despite being, on average, better educated and healthier than men. Whether prohibiting women from doing 456 jobs, 100, or one, denying women equality in their choice of profession has no place in a legal system.

Anna had worked for a decade in a job banned for women under Soviet-era regulations, which restrict women from 456 professions, including jobs like truck drivers and auto mechanics, based on the claim that such work could harm women’s fertility. Although these restrictions were initially defended for “protecting” women, the United Nations condemned them as discriminatory in 2016, urging reform.

In 2019, Russia’s Ministry of Labor shortened the list of banned jobs to 100, though women are still prohibited from working in certain high-risk fields, like chemical production and mining. Anna’s case exposed the absurdity of this law, as her firing was solely based on her legal gender change, not her job performance. Despite initial legal setbacks, Anna’s case was eventually won in 2019, and the court ruled in her favor, granting her compensation. The ruling was significant not only for transgender rights but also for gender equality, reinforcing that all women should have the right to choose their profession without legal restrictions.

The case underscores the need for Russia to abolish gender-based job restrictions and focus on ensuring workplace equality and safety for all workers, regardless of gender."

Can it win it back?Eduardo Campos LimaOctober 05, 2020Pro-life supporters pray during a 2019 protest outside the local congress in Oaxaca, Mexico. In late July, Mexico's bishops called on Catholics to speak out ahead of a ruling from the country's Supreme Court, which could lead to a nationwide decriminalization of abortion. CNS photoJorge Luis Plata, ReutersFeminist social movements have been mobilizing to decriminalize abortion in Latin American nations in recent years, provoking clashes with pro-life movements and the Catholic Church across the region. The latest campaigns have begun in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and the Mexican state of Veracruz, where legislative changes to allow abortion are being debated.Today, only Cuba, Guyana, French Guyana and Uruguay, as well as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, allow abortion without condition in the first weeks of a pregnancy. In some Latin American countries, women can terminate pregnancy only under three conditions if the pregnancy poses a risk to the mothers health, if the fetus has a fatal condition or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.On Sept. 28, the Day of Global Action for Legal and Safe Abortion, womens groups marched in several countries to press for the legalization of abortion. Activists for access to contraception and abortion charge that even when national laws allow abortion under limited conditions in countries like Brazil and Colombia, women face extralegal obstacles as hospitals and doctors refuse to perform the procedure or create technical barriers.The church has been campaigning against further legislative liberalization of abortion laws as evangelical Protestant groups and right-wing movements join the debate on the contentious issue.In the Mexican state of Veracruz, hospitals have historically failed to obey the law and give access to safe abortion to girls with ages varying from 10 to 14 who had been raped, said Luz Estrada, the coordinator for gender violence and human rights issues for Mexican Catholics for the Right to Decide.The church has been campaigning against further legislative liberalization of abortion laws throughout Latin America, making its case for the sacredness of life from conception. Now new social actors, especially evangelical Protestant groups and new right-wing movements in the region, have joined the debate on the contentious issue.The Catholic Church in Latin America has surrendered the leading role it once had in the cultural dialogue over abortion, according to Franciso Borba Ribeiro Neto, the director of the Pontifical Catholic Universitys Center of Faith and Culture in So Paulo, Brazil. While most people in Latin America see abortion as a terrible kind of murder, he said, theres a rift in value and practice. At the same time people repudiate abortion, they believe that society should not seek to punish a person who undergoes the procedure.Catholics in general have adopted a stern condemnation of abortion over the past 40 years, he said. But the churchs position did not allow for nuance, allowing left-wing movements some success in advocating for liberalization of abortion laws. As the cultural influence of Catholic groups that defended life diminished, new pro-life organizations, not connected to the church, emerged.New protagonists in the debate have goals that are focused as much on right-wing political success as they are on pro-life principles.The Peruvian group Con mis hijos no se metas Dont mess with my children and the Ecuadorian umbrella movement Consejo de Resistencia Fe, Vida y Familia Council of Resistance Faith, Life and Family, among others, have been active in campaigns against same-sex marriage, gender ideology in schools and abortion.Church officials and cultural commentators say these new protagonists in the debate have goals that are focused as much on right-wing political success as they are on pro-life principles.The Peruvian journalist Jonathan Castro reports that some of these emerging movements have been encouraged and trained by conservative organizations in the United States. His article reveals that Christian Rosas, the spokesperson for Con mis hijos no se metas, attended a training session in 2018 sponsored by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian organization, in the United States.Mr. Castros story was published as part of the Columbia Universityled project Transnacionales de la fe Transnationals of Faith, a consortium of Latin American newspapers investigating the connections between United States conservative groups and the new Christian right in Latin America.Now theres a big orchestration of Christian churches taking part in the debate on sexual and reproductive womens rights, sometimes leading to openly political movements, said Aura Cuasapud, legal advisor of the Colombian branch of Catholics for the Right to Choose, an organization inspired by Catholics for Choice in the United States but which operates autonomously in Latin America. Many of those groups are equipped with arguments that come from the United States.In the Dominican Republic, the Most Rev. Victor Masalles, bishop of Ban and one of the most active Catholic leaders in the campaign against abortion, agrees that over the past few years the civic discussion of abortion has been transformed by such movements, and he worries that some in the church could unwittingly be drawn into political entanglements. Theres certainly a pro-Trump movement of fundamentalist nature, so the left wing has been accusing us of being far-right-wingers, he lamented.The same way society discards the poor or the eldersas is happening now, during the Covid-19 pandemiclife in the mothers womb is sometimes discarded. But we mustnt discard anybody. At the same time, evangelical Protestant organizations have been trying to take advantage of the Catholic Church, said Bishop Masalles. We have a circumstantial unity with them during pro-life campaigns, but they want to gain ground on us, he told America.The Dominican Republic is one of the few Latin American or Caribbean countries where abortion is totally forbidden. But a debate on its decriminalizationunder the three usual conditionsresumed recently as part of the process of approval of a new penal code. After much pressure from the pro-life movement, Dominican legislators decided to address the idea of decriminalizing abortion in separate legislation.The Rev. Mario de la Cruz, episcopal vicar of the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, fears that decriminalizing abortion even just under the usual three exceptions could lead to the eventual acceptance of elective abortion in Dominican society. Bishop Masalles agrees.The three conditions allow for broad application. Its a matter of interpretation, he said.Father de la Cruz said that the church will keep campaigning against any change in the current law at the same time it will try to raise consciousness of the sacredness of life in society. The same way society discards the poor or the eldersas is happening now, during the Covid-19 pandemiclife in the mothers womb is sometimes discarded. But we mustnt discard anybody, he said.In Ecuador, rather than perceiving new voices on the issue as a threat, the Catholic Church has aligned itself with a broader pro-life coalition that includes evangelicals. We have exclusively Catholic initiatives that have led programs in defense of life and family for years. But at times we open space for movements of our evangelical brothers. We know that each one of us has a unique way of defending life, Archbishop Luis Herrera of Guayaquil told America.The church in the region missed an early opportunity to promote a civic discussion of womens rights and protection, but that remains one possible way to resume a lead role in the pro-life struggle.In 2019, an attempted reform of Ecuadors penal code included the decriminalization of abortion in cases of rape and incest and if the fetus had a terminal condition. After much pressure from pro-life campaigners, the reform was not approved. Abortion remained legal in the country only if the mothers health was in danger or if the pregnancy was the result of the violation of a woman with mental disability.In August 2020, another controversy regarding abortion began when the Ecuadorian Congress approved new health care legislation. One of the articles of the new law requires that women arriving at a hospital while terminating a pregnancy must be treated as obstetrics emergencies and that hospitals and medical professionals cannot deny assistance in such cases.That article doesnt promote nor decriminalize abortion. But theres a risk of leaving an open door to justify abortion, argued Mr. Cabrera. Some groups promote abortion using chemical substances, for instance. They could transform a procedure like that in an emergency and a doctor would be obliged to assist the patient and complete the procedure, he said.The church and other members of the pro-life alliance have campaigned for a veto of that provision from President Lenn Moreno. People worried about their survival during the pandemic. They took advantage of the lack of social reaction. But we have been mobilized for a veto, Mr. Cabrera said. On Sept. 25, the president vetoed the new bill.In Mexico, the clash between pro-life and pro-choice groups has been partially connected to party politics. In July, the State of Veracruz was at the center of a national dispute when the Supreme Court reviewed a petition from Catholics for the Right to Decide and other groups to decriminalize abortion there during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.In Mexico we fear that if the issue of abortion goes back to discussion in court, it might end up being decriminalized, first in Veracruz, then in the whole country.According to the Rev. Jos Manuel Suazo, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Xalapa, where the campaign has concentrated, the effort was initially begun by state legislators from Morena, President Andrs Manuel Lopez Obradors left-wing party.In 2017, they tried to change the law in Veracruz to decriminalize abortion under any circumstances during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. But the change was considered unconstitutional, he told America. An attempt to change state legislation followed. The case ended up in Mexicos Supreme Court, which rejected the petition to decriminalize abortion in July.But only technical aspects of the appeal factored in the courts decision, according to Father Suazo. Now we fear that if the issue of abortion goes back to discussion in court, it might end up being decriminalized, first in Veracruz, then in the whole country.According to Father Suazo, Mr. Lpez Obradors Secretariat of Home Affairs has been promoting initiatives to decriminalize abortion in many states. The current administration has a plan to liberate abortion, impose gender ideology and allow same-sex unions, Father Suazo alleged. He hopes Mexicans will oppose the Morena party in the 2021 legislative and municipal elections.Abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is currently allowed in Mexico City and Oaxaca. According to Ms. Estrada, women from across Mexico travel to the capital to undergo abortion procedures.RELATED STORIES How Covid-19 made sex trafficking in Latin America much worseEduardo Campos LimaMs. Estrada said that she and other members of Catholics for the Right to Decide have been threatened and verbally attacked. What the pro-life campaigners see as a type of international conspiracy for the decriminalization of abortion is in fact the progress of womens rights, she argued. The groups intention, she explained, is to fight for womens health and dignity.All the same, abortion should be a womans last resort, she added.In Latin America, where high rates of violence against women have been tolerated, there is an enduring sense that men own womens bodies, according to the Brazilian feminist theologian Luiza Tomita. Thats why its so hard to discuss sexuality and reproductive rights in the region. Such a patriarchalism comes from our colonial times and is still alive, she said.The church in the region missed an early opportunity to promote a civic discussion of womens rights and protection, but that remains one possible way to resume a lead role in the pro-life struggle, said Mr. Ribeiro Neto.The church must show solidarity to pregnant women in crisis, he said. There are movements throughout Latin America to support women and avoid abortion, with programs that include adoption, foster care and all kinds of help.By stressing such concrete actions in support of pregnant women, he said, the church could avoid the U.S.-style politicization of abortion that now haunts the pro-life movement in Latin America, allowing the church to propose its own views on how to deal with unplanned pregnancies.More Abortion Latin AmericaEduardo Campos LimaEduardo Campos Lima is a freelance journalist who contributes from So Paulo, Brazil.Show Comments Join the conversation Login or create an account Before you can comment, you need to update your profile to include your first and last name, as required in our comments policy.

These movements have shifted the pro-life debate, focusing not only on the sanctity of life but also on political and cultural issues such as opposition to same-sex marriage and gender ideology. Evangelical Protestant groups, in particular, have become prominent in advocating against abortion, sometimes with backing from U.S. conservative organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom.

The Catholic Church, which traditionally led the pro-life campaign in the region, has seen its influence waning. In many Latin American countries, the public’s views on abortion are complex. While abortion is still widely viewed as morally unacceptable, there is growing support for decriminalizing the procedure, especially in cases of rape, fetal abnormalities, or health risks to the mother. Women often face extralegal barriers to obtaining abortions even in countries where it is allowed under specific conditions, which has fueled feminist activism for reproductive rights.

Several countries, such as Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico, have recently debated abortion laws, often with the church opposing any liberalization. The Catholic Church’s position is largely uncompromising, stressing the sanctity of life from conception. However, new pro-life groups have emerged outside of the Church, often with political motives that align with right-wing agendas. These groups have drawn significant support from evangelical Christians and conservative organizations in the U.S.

In Mexico, the pro-life movement faces a political dimension, as left-wing government officials have pushed for abortion legalization. Meanwhile, in Ecuador, the Church has cooperated with evangelical groups to defend life but remains concerned about legal changes that could lead to broader abortion access. The Church has largely missed opportunities to engage in broader discussions about women’s rights and health care, leaving the field open for feminist movements to shape public opinion and law.

To regain its influence, the Church might consider shifting its focus to supporting pregnant women in crisis, promoting practical solutions like adoption and foster care, rather than solely engaging in political battles. This approach could help the Church avoid the politicized discourse around abortion, which has dominated the U.S. pro-life movement, and regain a leadership role in the Latin American pro-life struggle."

All rights reserved. An article claimed that a nearly 50 million United Nations humanitarian aid package to Ecuador was conditional on the South American country legalizing abortions. This is false the UN said there was no such condition, and abortion is already allowed under limited circumstances. UN Refuses to Send Coronavirus Funds to Pro-Life Nation Unless It Legalizes Abortions, read the headline of a May 18,2020 article on anti-abortion news website LifeNews. The article went on to claim that the United Nations is using coronavirus aid to pressure Ecuador to legalize the killing of unborn babies in abortions. A screenshot of an article taken on May 22, 2020 The preservation of access to sexual health services in Ecuador is included in the aid package, but the UN does not seek changes to the countrys laws on abortion, officials told AFP. The LifeNews article refers to an April 30 appeal from Ecuadors ministry of foreign relations for 46.4 million from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA, which has led the UNs international emergency response to the novel coronavirus. Ecuadors application, accessible here in Spanish, outlines areas of need, including food safety, health, housing and education. The government document includes the goal of maintaining the continuity of maternal, neonatal and childrens health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic. Ecuador also aims to raise awareness about the need for safe and legal access to abortion, the document says, which is what the online articles portray as the UNs condition for aid. Any suggestion that we are using the COVID19 pandemic response as an opportunity to promote abortion is not correct, Zoe Paxton, a spokeswoman for OCHA in New York, told AFP by email. While we support healthcare that prevents millions of women from dying during pregnancy and childbirth and protects people from sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, we do not seek to override any national law. On May 26, 2020, following publication of this fact check, LifeNews revised its article and changed the headline, after undertaking what it said was ""further investigation into the original claims groups made about the UN and the coronavirus relief plan."" To counter the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in fragile countries, the UN agency made a 6.7 billion appeal for its Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to be distributed to various countries according to their various humanitarian needs, including the 46.4 million to Ecuador. Abortion in Ecuador is only legal when the pregnancy constitutes a threat to a womans life or health, or when it is the result of the rape of a mentally disabled woman. Mario Naranjo, a UN spokesman in Ecuador, told AFP by email The plan only aims to apply national law, which allows safe abortion under two circumstances clearly defined in the Ecuadorian criminal code. Humanitarian aid is granted without conditions. The response plan is not funded by the UN, but by voluntary contributions from governments. Funds cannot be withheld at the moment as the article claims, because only 15 percent of the money had been raised by May 20, according to Naranjo. In any case, the money would not be given to the Ecuadorian government but rather to its Humanitarian Country Team and non-governmental organizations that are a part of it. The original LifeNews article followed a May 17 piece from the Catholic News Agency headlined In Ecuador, pro-life groups protest U.N. abortion conditions on coronavirus aid. Hector Lepez, a member of parliament in Ecuador, was one of the first to denounce the conditions for OCHAs aid package, in a Facebook post featuring the response plans goals in regard to sexual health.

The claim was based on a misunderstanding of an Ecuadorian government appeal for humanitarian aid, which outlined goals for maintaining sexual and reproductive health services, including safe and legal abortion access, but did not make abortion legalization a condition for aid.

The UN clarified that its humanitarian aid focused on supporting public health during the pandemic, not on changing national laws. The UN emphasized that it supports healthcare that reduces maternal and child mortality and promotes sexual health, but it does not seek to override Ecuador’s laws, which allow abortion only in specific cases—when the pregnancy threatens a woman’s life or health, or if the pregnancy results from the rape of a mentally disabled woman.

LifeNews later revised the article following the UN’s response, admitting that its original claims were inaccurate. The UN’s humanitarian response plan is not funded by the UN but by voluntary contributions from governments, and the funds are directed to local humanitarian organizations rather than the Ecuadorian government itself."

Morrison and Sonia M. Suter Jan 11, 2022404 PM Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi attends a news conference on the Womens Health Protection Act on Sept. 24. Saul LoebGetty Images Tweet Share Comment If you had any doubts about the newly reconstituted Supreme Courts view of abortion, its decision barely preserving the challenge to Texass six-week ban on abortions should make it clear that Roe v. Wade is dead, likely as soon as this year. Facing this reality, it is time to figure out what the federal government can do to counteract what many states have already done, and will do, to make abortions difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. One branch of Congress has already acted by passing a law seeking to codify Roe, but given the realities of this court and the Senate filibuster, it is clear that a different course is necessary. The situation, though, is not hopeless. The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed H.R. 3755, the Womens Health Protection Act of 2021, which is designed to save the right to abortion in every state. Appealing as that law may be, we fear it will not only fail, but will also backfire. First, there is no chance that it will survive a filibuster in the Senate, which the Democrats have been unable to end or even curtail. Second, it is almost certain that the Supreme Court would rule that Congress lacked the power to enact that law. Critically, Congress cannot base its authority to enact H.R. 3755 on its power to protect constitutional rights like abortion because, once Roe falls, that power goes with it. A claim of Congressional authority rooted in the commerce clause will fare just as poorly with the federal judiciary in 2012, a far less conservative Supreme Court rejected that basis for the Affordable Care Act, which has a much firmer commerce basis than do abortion protections. The most significant risk in pursuing H.R. 3755 is that it would become a very dangerous two-edged sword if upheld by the court. If Congress can legislate to protect abortion rights, it certainly can outlaw abortions, even in states that fully protect the right to an abortion now. The risk of passing H.R. 3755 is that Republicans will do just that the next time they control the White House and both branches of Congress. This doesnt mean, however, that Congress and the Biden administration are powerless to preserve the ability of patients to obtain lawful abortions. Even if Congress cannot make abortions accessible everywhere or without difficulty, several important steps can be taken to preserve much greater access than many Republican-controlled states are likely to allow. First, states with abortion bans are likely to try to criminalize efforts by women, with the advice of their health professionals, to obtain abortions in jurisdictions where they are still legal. In our judgment, the courts should rely on the right to travel and the prohibition against states burdening interstate commerce to strike down any efforts to criminalize abortions obtained out of state. Congress should not wait, however, or expect the courts to come to the rescue. Instead, it should enact a law spelling out the right to seek an out-of-state abortion and provide corresponding protections for doctors and others who assist those traveling to obtain abortions where they remain legal. For many women, however, the right to travel to another state is wholly theoretical because they cannot afford to make the trip, let alone pay for childcare or lose wages in leaving home for a day or more. Private parties can offer donations, but much more money is needed. As a result, we urge Congress to create a multi-million-dollar abortion expense fund, to be awarded to non-profit organizations that will provide the funds directly to women who require such support. One barrier to this approachand to abortion access generally for more than 40 yearshas been the Hyde amendment to the federal Medicaid law, which prohibits the use of federal money for abortions. Now, more than ever, it is urgent to repeal the amendment permanently, as H.R. 2234 proposes, which would evade the filibuster if included as part of the budget reconciliation process. Moreover, Congress should make the provision of abortion services, which professional organizations consider an essential component of womens health care, available to all Medicaid eligible patients. Thus, even if a state banned all abortions, federal funding would be made available to all Medicaid patients to pay for an abortion that would be performed in a state where it is legal. Congress should also re-affirm that women in the military, as well as the spouses and dependents of service members, can continue to have abortions paid for as part of their health insurance. The same should apply to women who receive abortion services through federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Indian Health Service. Popular in Even the Supreme Courts Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit Stormy Daniels Is Telling a Different, Darker Story Than She Used To John Roberts Just Dropped the Hammer on Rogue, Lawless Trump Judges So Trumps Trial Delay Tactics Really Worked, Huh? Meanwhile, many federal employees have health insurance covering abortions, but live in states where abortions will soon be banned, or at least severely restricted. In order to assure that those federal employees and their families can retain that benefit, Congress should pass a law preempting any state law to the contrary. Similarly, Congress should require employment-based health insurance plans, which are governed by a federal law known as ERISA, to cover abortion, thereby assuring abortions can be performed in anti-abortion states. Recently, the Food Drug Administration removed its longstanding and medically unnecessary restriction on the ability of pregnant patients to obtain mifepristoneone of two drugs used for medication abortionsdirectly from pharmacies or by mail, without visiting a doctor. The FDA should also make clear, with an express authorization from Congress, that states may not interfere with the use of mifepristone, a federally-approved drug, whether for abortion or other purposes. There are likely to be many more ways in which the federal government, operating within the limits of federalism, can protect its legitimate interests and help preserve access to abortion. These and other creative efforts will be required until states remove harsh restrictions on abortions, or a more sympathetic Supreme Court recognizes that Roe was properly decided and that the Constitution does protect a womens right to an abortion.

Wade, Alan B. Morrison and Sonia M. Suter explore how Congress can protect abortion rights without directly codifying Roe. The authors argue that while the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021 (H.R. 3755) aims to preserve abortion access, it is unlikely to survive the Senate filibuster or be upheld by the conservative Supreme Court. They caution that such a law could backfire, as it could give future Congresses the power to restrict abortion nationwide.

Instead, the authors propose several strategies for Congress and the Biden administration to preserve abortion access. These include enacting laws that safeguard the right to travel for an abortion and protect those who assist women in obtaining abortions across state lines. They also recommend creating a fund to assist women with the costs of traveling for abortions, repealing the Hyde Amendment (which prohibits federal funding for abortions), and ensuring Medicaid covers abortion services, particularly in states where abortion is banned.

Additionally, the authors suggest expanding abortion access for federal employees, service members, and others covered by federal health insurance. They also advocate for laws that protect the use of mifepristone (a medication for abortion) from state interference and encourage more federal initiatives to support abortion access. These measures, they argue, would help maintain abortion rights in a post-Roe world until the Supreme Court might reconsider its stance or states lift harsh restrictions."

Sayers, CNN 3 minute read Updated 724 PM EST, Tue November 15, 2022 Link Copied! Activists rally outside the State Capitol in support of abortion rights in Atlanta, Georgia on May 14, 2022. Elijah NouvelageAFPGetty Images Washington CNN A Georgia Superior Court judge has overturned the states law banning abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy, ruling it unconstitutional and saying it cannot be enforced. The decision from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney makes the procedure legal in the state again until at least 20 weeks of pregnancy, effective immediately. The judges order comes in response to a lawsuit that sought to strike down the ban on multiple grounds and will apply statewide. HB481, dubbed Georgias LIFE Act, bans, with some exceptions, abortion when early cardiac activity is detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when many women dont yet know they are pregnant. The lawsuit was filed by SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a group that seeks to strengthen and amplify the collective voices of indigenous women and women of color to achieve reproductive justice, according to the groups website. After a long road, we are finally able to celebrate the end of an extreme abortion ban in our state, Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, said in a statement, adding While we applaud the end of a ban steeped in white supremacy, it should not have existed in the first place. Now, its time to move forward with a vision for Georgia that establishes full bodily autonomy and liberation for our communities. In his opinion, McBurney wrote that when Georgia lawmakers passed the bill and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, the supreme law of this land unequivocally was and had been for nearly half a century that laws unduly restricting abortion before viability were unconstitutional. Because the right to pre-viability abortion existed nationwide when the law was enacted, Georgia could not legally restrict it at that time, he wrote. The state has filed a notice of appeal, according to a Kemp spokesperson. Todays ruling places the personal beliefs of a judge over the will of the legislature and people of Georgia, the spokesperson said. When approving the measure in 2019, Kemp had said I realize that some may challenge it in a court of law. But our job is to do what is right, not what is easy. We are called to be strong and courageous, and we will not back down. We will always continue to fight for life. State Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, will continue to fulfill our duty to defend the laws of our state in court, his spokesman, Kara Richardson, said in an email. McBurney wrote in his opinion that sections of the legislation were plainly unconstitutional when drafted, voted upon, and enacted. Everywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments federal, state, or local to ban abortions before viability, he wrote, adding that if the courts have spoken, clearly and directly, as to what the law is, as to what is and is not constitutional, legislatures and legislators are not at liberty to pass laws contrary to such pronouncements. While signed into law in 2019, the legislation had been blocked from taking effect until this summer. After the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization which overturned Roe v. Wade, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion the Georgia ban remained on hold for several weeks until a federal appellate court allowed the law to be immediately enforced. McBurney wrote that lawmakers might pass similar legislation in light of the Dobbs ruling, but they would first have to face the sharp glare of public attention that will undoubtedly and properly attend such an important and consequential debate whether the rights of unborn children justify such a restriction on womens right to bodily autonomy and privacy.

The law, which bans most abortions when cardiac activity is detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, had been blocked since its passage in 2019. The decision by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney makes abortion legal in Georgia up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, effective immediately.

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, which argued that the law was unconstitutional. McBurney emphasized that, when the law was passed, the Supreme Court had consistently upheld the constitutional right to an abortion before viability. He noted that Georgia could not legally restrict abortion at that time. Despite the ruling, the state has filed an appeal, with Governor Brian Kemp and Attorney General Chris Carr vowing to continue defending the law.

The LIFE Act had been blocked following the 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. This ruling allowed the Georgia law to be enforced temporarily. McBurney’s opinion also highlighted that, although similar laws may be proposed in the future, they would require careful public debate and consideration of women’s bodily autonomy and privacy rights."

Blaming the influence of the Catholic Church, in part, for the drastic assault on womens rights, some protesters targeted churches. In cities around the country, members of far-right ultranationalist groups, backed by groups of hardcore football fans, appointed themselves as protectors of the churches, and proceeded to brutally confront the protesters.AdvertisementAt Warsaws Church of the Holy Cross, women were hauled down the church steps by burly men, who hurled misogynistic insults as they did so. In the aftermath, Robert Bkiewicz, the ultranationalist leader in the thick of the confrontation at the church, announced he was forming a vigilante National Guard to repel the protesters, who he referred to as leftist barbarians.We will defend every church, every district, every town, every village, he said. I can say that a sword of justice is hanging upon them, and if necessary, we will turn them into dust and destroy this revolution.Yet despite a police warning that the far-right vigilantes were inflaming the situation, figures from the countrys conservative ruling Law and Justice party publicly supported them.Law and Justice leader Jarosaw Kaczyski, considered Polands most powerful politician, called on Catholics to mobilise and defend the churches, while one of his MPs, Tomasz Rzymkowski, commended the young nationalists who were defending the church, as well as the whole of Latin civilisation, against the barbarians.While the clashes that rocked Poland in the wake of the abortion ruling were shocking, they werent exactly new.

Emboldened by the aggressively nationalist direction of the conservative government which has sought to forcefully impose its traditionalist vision on Polish society these men, drawn from neofascist ultranationalist movements and the football hooligan scene, have consistently acted as willing foot soldiers in their countrys furious culture wars. AdvertisementNews'There Is No Turning Back' Polish Women Undeterred by Threat of Far-Right Violence Tim Hume, Nina Zabicka10.30.20Since coming to power in 2015, the right-wing populist Law and Justice government has proven itself unlike any previous Polish administration in the post-Communist era, rapidly remaking the country in its own image, in a way that critics say imperils the countrys democratic order.Its stacked courts with loyalists, tightened its grip on the media, and systematically sought to roll back socially liberal values. Adopting a nationalist agenda as central to its populist platform, Law and Justice has demonised minorities, polarised society, and emboldened the far-right, allowing radical right-wing sentiment to creep from the margins into the mainstream.Far-right supporters take part in the independence march last year.

State-appointed watchdog Adam Bodnar, Polands Commissioner for Human Rights, says Law and Justices tactics are jeopardising Polands democracy, particularly in its empowering of the far-right.This moment when the leader of the country is sharing the monopoly for violence with private organisations like the far-right is extremely dangerous to democracy, he told VICE World News, referring to Law and Justices endorsement of the ultranationalist church defenders amid the protests over abortion rights.It is a little bit like playing with fire you are opening some possibilities for them. You are giving them some positions in the whole structure of the state.AdvertisementSince 2015, Law and Justice has relied on a political M.O. of routinely scapegoating minority groups to whip up waves of support from its conservative base.It came into government in 2015, at the height of the European migration crisis, on the back of a wave of anti-migrant hysteria that resulted in an outpouring of Islamophobic sentiment despite Poland being overwhelming homogenous, with a tiny Muslim population, and not being situated on main migration routes through Europe.READ Polands populist government let right-wing extremism explode into the mainstreamThen, seeking a new target, Law and Justice moved on to the LGBTQ community, with leading politicians in recent successive election campaigns painting gay rights as a dangerous, alien ideology that threatens the traditional, Catholic Polish family unit. A man wearing a white supremacist mask and T-shirt takes part in an anti-LGBTQ demonstration in Krakow last summer. Photo Beata ZawrzelNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe sustained and ugly onslaught came from the highest levels of the party, with Kaczyski describing calls for greater LGBTQ rights as a great danger and essentially an attack on children. Other Law and Justice politicians tweeted that Poland is most beautiful without LGBT, or compared gay marriage to bestiality, while about 100 municipal councils accounting for about a third of Polands territory adopted resolutions declaring themselves LGBT-free zones.AdvertisementThe hate speech from those in power emboldened bigots, and unleashed a wave of public hostility thats left the LGBTQ community under attack, often physically so. At events like the 2019 Pride march in the city of Bialystok, marchers were set upon by a hostile far-right mob of hooligans, ultranationalists and Catholic hardliners who assaulted them with impunity.READ Polands ruling party is using homophobia to attract votersPeople got attacked.

The decision, made by a court stacked with Law and Justice appointees, outlawed the most common of the few existing grounds for legal termination in a country that already had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. For critics, it represented the culmination of a systematic wave of attacks on womens rights by the ruling party.You feel like you are in a war with your own government, Justyna Wydrzyska, a board member of Abortion Without Borders, an initiative that helps Polish women access abortions, told VICE World News.AdvertisementNewsWe Are Governed By Morons' Poland's Leading Pro-Choice ActivistPawe Mczewski01.25.21Bodnar, Polands Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the abortion ban which came into effect in January represented the government paying a political debt to the Catholic Church. When the Catholic Church has a strong stance on abortion, then the coin which is paid is a restriction on of access to abortion.All of which has made the countrys far-right fringe increasingly brazen, buoyed by the countrys sharp lurch to the right under Law and Justice. One of the clearest illustrations of its growing confidence is the annual Independence March in Warsaw, held every November 11 on the anniversary of the restoration of Polish independence in 1918.A police officer faces a woman as she argues against a pro-life counter protest in Krakow last October.

Since coming to power in 2015, PiS has used nationalist rhetoric to consolidate power, empowering ultranationalist groups and football hooligans, who have become active participants in the country’s political conflicts.

A key event fueling this divide was a 2020 ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Court that severely restricted abortion rights, sparking protests and violent confrontations between far-right vigilantes and demonstrators. PiS politicians supported these far-right groups, escalating the violence. The government’s anti-LGBTQ+ stance further exacerbated the situation, with high-profile leaders, including PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński, decrying LGBTQ+ rights as a threat to Polish Catholic values. The government’s rhetoric, which included the creation of “LGBT-free zones” across Poland, has emboldened far-right groups to target LGBTQ+ individuals and activists, resulting in violent assaults during events like Pride marches.

The far-right has also hijacked Poland’s Independence Day march, which now often descends into violent clashes, with the event serving as a platform for extremist views. PiS’s stance, which reflects a broader push to enforce traditionalist values, has aligned with these far-right groups. This alignment has eroded Poland’s democratic institutions, with PiS undermining judicial independence and silencing human rights defenders, such as the ousting of Poland’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Adam Bodnar.

Despite the increasing authoritarianism, progressive Poles continue to resist, though they face growing hostility and fear for their country’s future. The article underscores the toll on marginalized groups, especially LGBTQ+ youth, and illustrates the broader cultural and political divide that has left many concerned about Poland’s democratic future."
Abortion as a Human Right: The Fight for Reproductive Rights in Argentina and Poland,"Abortion as a Human Right The Fight for Reproductive Rights in Argentina and Poland US Europe Asia Middle East Africa Americas Oceania Archives Log In Subscribe 07.Feb.2022 . 10 min read On September 22, 2021, a 30-year-old Polish woman named Izabela died of septic shock at the hospital after her unborn babys heart stopped beating. Her death initiated waves of protests across Poland and was seen as the direct consequence of a near total ban on abortion passed in 2020, which outlawed the termination of pregnancies even in the case of fetal defects. Under this new law, unlawful abortion could lead to up to eight years in prison. Terrified of the law and of its potential consequences, Izabelas doctors waited too long to terminate the pregnancy despite knowing the potential risks for the motherresulting in her death. The case of Poland sheds light on a puzzling contemporary phenomenon. The right to abortion has recently been under attack in several countries where it was previously legalized in the late 20th century. In September 2021, the US Supreme Court refused to block legislation in Texas that would ban terminations of pregnancy after six weeks, which is after many women are even aware that they are pregnant. In Turkey, where abortion has been legal since 1983, President Erdogans conservative position on abortion is making it increasingly difficult for women to access abortions in public hospitals. Though there is no formal legal basis criminalizing abortion yet, Erdogan's anti-abortion rhetoric has deterred many public providers from conducting the procedurewith the presidents words holding more significance than the actual law. In China, where abortion restrictions had been relaxed in the 1960s, the government is now moving to limit access to abortion in response to the countrys falling birth rates and gender inequality.These countries are moving in the opposite direction of the global trend of relaxing abortion laws. Since 2018, nations such as Ireland, Mexico, South Korea, and Argentinawhich traditionally had very strict regulations on the issuevoted for the decriminalization of abortion in landmark rulings. In Mexico, the decision came around the same time as the Texan abortion ban, raising the prospect of American women travelling across the border to receive an abortion. In Argentina and Ireland, the decision came in the aftermath of massive years-long protests, with the Catholic Church historically opposing access to abortion. What explains these divergent global trends in abortion access? Religion has typically been a deciding factor in national legislation on abortion. Countries with a strong Catholic national identity, such as Ireland and Poland, historically resisted adopting pro-choice legislation. Yet the cases of Ireland, Argentina, and Mexico, contradict this point their recent pro-choice rulings being a major blow to national religious establishments. To explain this divergence, we can look to the contrasting cases of Argentina and Polandtwo Catholic societies that made the news in 2020 for their abortion legislationin an effort to understand the nuances that lead to legalization versus criminalization.The Marea Verde Argentinas Historical Pro-Choice SuccessIn the early 21st century, Argentina was among the dozens of countries in Latin America and the worldwith restricted access to abortion. Because of the strong influence of the Catholic Church, barriers to abortion had been ingrained in the countrys legal system, but also in the minds and consciousness of health providers, many of whom consistently refused to support abortion. Though abortion had been legalized in the case of rape or threats of life to the mother in 2012, illegal terminations of pregnancy for other reasons were still widespread in the country, supported by Soccoristasa network of volunteers who provided support during medication abortions outside the formal health care system. Soccoristas primarily acted as sources of medical information, and they provided both psychological support and connections to doctors who were willing to conduct the abortion procedures. Before legalization, abortion was the third leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in Argentina, with an average of 56 deaths a year reported to have occurred as a result of complications following an abortion.In response to these restrictions and health concerns, the Marea Verde Green Wave movement began in 2018 when Argentine women took to the streets wearing green scarves to support the full legalization of abortion. The green scarves had been used for several years as part of the NiUnaMenos Not One Woman Less movement against violence towards womenthe scarves themselves were a resistance symbol that dated back to the days of military dictatorship, when mothers and grandmothers of desaparecidos people who had been abducted or disappeared for political reasons protested against state violence on the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.Millions of women took part in the Green Wave protests, and decades of grass-roots pressure proved effective over time. In 2018, the movement faced disappointment when legalization failed in the Senate by a 38 to 31 margin. At the time, arguments had centered around morality and religion, but after 2018, the arguments transitioned to a public health focus. Rooted in the NiUnaMenos movement and the fight against gendered violence, the pro-choice movement after 2018 focused on mothers health and the public health costs of criminalization. Clandestine abortion clinics were operating in Argentina, legal or not, and regularization would only make their practices safer. In the Green Wave movement, legalization was not about the life or death of a fetusit was about the life or death of a mother.Finally, at the peak of the Green Wave protests and also in the middle of a global pandemic, a second bill was brought to the Argentina Senate for the legalization of abortion. On December 30, 2020, after hours of debate, the bill was approved with a 38 to 29 margina historic moment for Argentina. In the streets, supporters of the legislation turned the night into a celebration with music and dancing, filled with the emotion that can only come with the end of a generations-long struggle.Women at a Green Wave protest in Argentina.

Months later, protesters in Mexico wore the same green scarves in the streets before the Supreme Court ruled criminalizing abortion as unconstitutional. The symbol made its way to Europe, where Polish protesters took to the streets wearing the same green scarves. In Poland, however, the protestors faced a different challenge, attempting to resist a recent near-total ban on abortion in a country that had liberalized access to abortion in the past.The Black Protests Polands Recriminalization of AbortionIn the early 1900s, many considered Poland a trailblazer with respect to abortion rights. In 1932, Poland legalized abortion in the cases of rape, incest, and when the pregnancy endangered the mothers life or health. It was the second country in the world to do so, falling only behind the Soviet Union. In 1956, Poland expanded abortion rights to include social justifications for obtaining an abortion. Specifically, when women cited difficult living conditions, Polish laws deemed them eligible to obtain an abortion. From 1956-1989, 97 percent of all abortions were performed for social reasons. Much of this progress can be attributed to the subordinate role of the Catholic Church under the communist government. With a weak Church unable to present much opposition, the communist government seized the moment to pass liberal abortion laws. They saw clear benefits from legalizing abortion as women would be able to obtain them safely, instead of risking their lives during illegal procedures.In 1990, however, the communist regime fell due to pressure from the Solidarity Movement, a group that began as a trade union but transformed into an anti-communist social movement. As a result, the Polish government could no longer restrain the Churchs influence. With 87 percent of adults in Poland identifying as Catholic, Catholic influence in Poland was always inevitable. And when the communist regime fell, the Church saw a new surge in power thanks to its tremendous involvement in the anti-communist movement. The Catholic Church had been consolidating power since the inception of the communist government, working to build more churches and parishes to expand its national network. When the Solidarity Movement began, the Church seized the opportunity to get involved and celebrated the birth of the Solidarity Congress with a mass in a nearby church. The Church became an emblem of resistance against communism, and Poland rebuilt its government under the backdrop of a rising tide of Catholic nationalism. The Church aimed to institutionalize its influence in Polish society and pushed the government to pass pro-religious laws, such as those allowing Catholic instruction in public schools and religious displays in governmental offices. Predictably, this religious influence prompted the government to pass more restrictive abortion laws. Beginning in 1990, abortion received national attention as a controversial issue, and new regulations made it substantially harder for women to receive them. New laws required consent from three specialists and a psychologist to go through with the procedure, and allowed them to charge consultation fees. In early 1993, Poland removed the ability to obtain an abortion for social reasons. When a liberal government was elected later in 1993, it found ways to reintroduce social justifications, but only up until 12 weeks gestational age and with required counseling. The law was finally settled in 1997, when the Constitutional Court decided that social abortions were unconstitutional.Since then, Poland has continued to put forward more restrictions on abortion, with multiple iterations of bills proposing to almost entirely ban the practice. Polands anti-abortion laws are largely driven by the Law and Justice Party PiS Party, which is functionally a Catholic nationalist party. The party believes that the Church and Polish government should be interconnected, and views the Church as integral to Polish national identity. The most threatening attempt to restrict abortion rights occurred in 2016, which resulted in the first large wave of abortion protests in Poland. This abortion bill came about as a result of a citizens initiativea petition with at least 100,000 signatures. This specific petition received 450,000 signatures. On October 3, 2016, up to 116,000 people protested nationwide against the legislation. This day came to be known as Black Monday, inspired by the 1975 protests in Iceland against unfair employment practices and wage discrepancies. Thousands of women went on strike against proposals for an abortion ban that would be as restrictive as the ban in place in the Vatican. The law would have punished women who received an abortion with 5 years in prison, and threatened doctors who performed abortions with emprisonment. At this point, Poland already had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, only allowing abortion in cases of fetal anomaly, threat to the mothers health or life, and rape or sexual abuse. The Parliament ultimately rejected the bill by a margin of 352 to 58.Activists in the 2016 protests in Poland holding black umbrellas. blackprotest czarnyprotest by Grzegorz ukowski licensed under Flikr.Polands main opposition party, the Civic Platform, only recently began emphasizing abortion rights as part of its agenda, which explains why protests are just now gaining momentum after years of restrictive policies. Slowly but surely, the Polish public is becoming more approving of abortion rights, indicating the waning influence of national Catholicism on this issue. Currently, about two-thirds of Poles support legal abortion up to 12 weeksa substantial increase compared to the 59 percent who supported the policy in 2019. Nevertheless, despite these political shifts, abortion rights in Poland are once again under attack. On October 22, 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal, the highest court in Poland, banned abortions due to fetal defects claiming they violate the right to life. Massive protests ensued on October 23, as fetal defects comprised 98 percent of abortions in Poland. More than 430,000 people attended the demonstrations, making them the largest protests in Poland since the Solidarity Movement. Protesters showed up carrying black umbrellas, which became a symbol of abortion rights after women used umbrellas to shield themselves from rain in the 2016 protests. In response to the protests, Polish president Andrzej Duda publicly offered to propose a bill reinstating abortion rights in cases of fetal abnormalities. Instead, the government agreed to delay the publication and implementation of the Constitutional Tribunal ruling. However, on January 27, 2021, the ruling was finally published, implementing the law prohibiting women from obtaining abortions for fetal defects.As the situation in Poland becomes more dire, many question what happened to this country, which was once considered a bastion of hope for abortion in Europe. But is it accurate to view Poland this way?Taking Abortion Rights for Granted Fighting the Good FightAt face value, Poland seems like a case of rising conservatism undoing liberal progress. In reality, under the communist regime, abortion was not truly considered an inviolable human right by the Polish population. The communist government merely viewed abortion as a utilitarian tool for dealing with unwanted pregnancies many women lacked knowledge about contraception, so the government viewed abortion as a second-best option for population control. Once the communist government lost power, Poland reverted to the baseline for most religious societies and heavily restricted abortion.This trend of abortion rights being granted as a utilitarian tool rather than a fundamental human right is not unique to Poland. Turkey legalized abortion in 1983 to reduce the number of women dying from unsafe, illegal abortions. However, this did not occur as a result of protests, but rather at the discretion of a military government. As such, abortion was not necessarily recognized as a human right, but rather as a societal necessity declared by a dictatorial government. Similarly, China had begun allowing abortions in the 1960s as part of a birth control campaign, before making it illegal again when faced with a declining population. Once again, the government had legalized abortion not as a result of protests or a desire to recognize womens rights, but for utilitarian reasonswhich makes it easier today for these governments to restrict abortion. In summary, historical trends suggest that countries that legalize abortion for demographic reasons have laws that are easy to overturn with changes in governmental power. In contrast, countries that legalize abortion as a result of protests may have laws that are much more difficult to overturn, since abortion is more ingrained in society as a human right. Ultimately, the Argentine and Polish struggles are intricately interconnected, as both movements work to combat the power of the Catholic Church to determine the national sentiment on abortion. Both groups are demanding abortion be recognized as a fundamental human right. As such, activists from both countries can learn from each other, seeing how certain tactics galvanize public support and convince Catholic populations to endorse pro-choice policies. The only notable difference between Argentina and Poland in this regard is that Polands communist government, for 40 years, managed to stave off the Catholic Churchs influence by dictatorially instituting abortion rightswhile never truly incorporating the right to abortion into Polish society. Therefore, the story being told about abortion in Poland is actually backwards the fight has not been reignited, it has only just begun.

In Poland, the near-total abortion ban, enacted in 2020, prohibits abortion even in cases of fetal defects. This law contributed to the death of Izabela, a woman who died from septic shock after her fetus’ heart stopped beating, as doctors hesitated to perform an abortion due to legal fears. Poland’s restrictive abortion laws stem from the influence of the Catholic Church, which gained power after the fall of the communist regime. Historically, Poland had liberal abortion laws during communism, but the Church’s rising influence after 1989 led to increasingly restrictive laws. Protests against these laws have surged, including massive demonstrations in 2020 after the Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling that banned abortions due to fetal defects.

In contrast, Argentina’s path to abortion legalization was shaped by the grassroots Marea Verde (Green Wave) movement, which began in 2018. The movement aimed to legalize abortion not only as a matter of women’s rights but also as a public health issue, given the high number of unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. Despite early setbacks, the movement succeeded in December 2020 when the Argentine Senate passed a historic bill to legalize abortion, making it the first major Latin American country to do so. This victory, sparked by years of protest and the influence of the NiUnaMenos movement against gender violence, inspired other countries like Mexico and Poland to push for reproductive rights.

The article compares these two countries’ struggles by exploring the role of the Catholic Church in shaping abortion laws. While both Argentina and Poland have Catholic majorities, Argentina’s success in legalizing abortion shows the power of sustained grassroots activism, whereas Poland’s restrictive laws reveal the challenges posed by religious nationalism. The piece argues that while some countries, like Poland, legalize abortion as a utilitarian tool for public health, others, like Argentina, have fought for abortion as a human right. This divergence highlights the broader global trend where abortion rights are not just about legal change but are deeply intertwined with political, cultural, and religious dynamics.

In conclusion, the fight for abortion rights in both countries exemplifies the tensions between religious influence, political power, and public health concerns, showing how societal shifts and activism can lead to either progress or regression in reproductive rights."

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holds up a 15-week abortion ban law after signing it, Thursday, April 14, 2022, in Kissimmee, Fla. John RaouxAP CNN Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Thursday a Mississippi-style anti-abortion measure that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The bill, which goes into effect July 1, does allow exemptions in cases where a pregnancy is serious risk to the mother or a fatal fetal abnormality is detected if two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing. The bill makes Florida the latest Republican-led state to advance a 15-week abortion ban bill this session. Additionally, the Kentucky legislature on Wednesday overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshears veto of a broad abortion bill that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. And in Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill into law that makes performing an abortion illegal in the state, with an exception only in the case of a medical emergency. The US Supreme Court appears poised to uphold the Mississippi law that bars abortion after 15 weeks. The fate of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, also hangs in the balance, and anti-abortion activists are hopeful that the courts conservative majority will strike it down. Previously, Florida had allowed abortion through the second trimester of a pregnancy, making it one of the most permissive states for abortion in the southeast. Abortion advocates said many women from neighboring states often traveled to Florida for the procedure, meaning changes to Floridas law could be felt all throughout the region. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Florida reported 71,914 abortions in 2019, or 18.5 per 1,000 women, the third highest rate in the country. We are here today to defend those who cant defend themselves, DeSantis said Thursday on a stage surrounded by several female lawmakers, anti-abortion advocates and children. This will represent the most significant protections for life that we have seen in a generation.

The state Senate passed the bill 23-15 on March 15 over the objections of Democrats, who shared painful and emotional stories of women who elected to have an abortion after a trauma. State Sen. Lauren Book, a Plantation Democrat and the leader of the minority party, told colleagues she was a victim of rape and implored lawmakers to include an exemption for women who become pregnant as a result of sexual violence. Book broke down into tears after the proposed amendment was rejected by Republicans, who have a majority in the chamber. President Joe Biden, in a March tweet, called Floridas new abortion restriction a dangerous bill that will severely restrict womens access to reproductive health care.

CNN Sans 2016 Cable News Network.","On April 14, 2022, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law a 15-week abortion ban, similar to a Mississippi law. This new law, effective July 1, prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or human trafficking. However, it allows exceptions if a pregnancy poses a serious risk to the mother or if a fatal fetal abnormality is diagnosed, confirmed by two physicians.

This legislation follows similar moves by other Republican-led states, including Kentucky and Oklahoma, which have passed similar 15-week abortion bans or more restrictive measures. Florida’s new law represents a significant shift from its previous stance, where abortions were allowed up to the second trimester. As a result, many women from neighboring states who sought abortions in Florida could be impacted.

DeSantis emphasized that the law offers the “most significant protections for life” in a generation. The bill passed the state Senate 23-15, with Democrats arguing for exemptions, especially for women who are victims of sexual violence. State Senator Lauren Book, a rape survivor, advocated for such an exemption, but her proposal was rejected. President Joe Biden criticized the law, calling it a dangerous restriction on women’s reproductive rights."

Tens of thousands of people, gathering in defiance of pandemic restrictions, vented their frustration about the abortion ruling and more broadly at perceived restrictions on their freedoms under the right-wing ruling party, Law and Justice.With military gendarmes ordered to monitor the crowds, protesters demanded the Polish governments resignation.Protests against last weeks court ruling also spread to other countries. People gathered at Polands embassies in Stockholm, Lisbon and Rome in solidarity with Polish women.Poland, a mainly Catholic country, already had one of Europes most restrictive abortion laws. The ruling that declared it unconstitutional to terminate pregnancies for congenital defects amounts to a near-total ban. In Warsaw on Wednesday, demonstrators marched from the office of Ordo Iuris, a conservative group that has been lobbying for years for a full abortion ban, to the parliament building, which was surrounded by police officers in riot gear. Large crowds also filled the streets in other major cities, including Krakow, Wroclaw, Szczecin and Lodz. In parliament, Polands most powerful politician, ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, lashed out at opposition lawmakers, accusing them from the podium of inciting people to protest during the pandemic. You are destroying Poland, Kaczynski told them. You are exposing a lot of people to death, you are criminals.The nationwide strike and protests have been largely organized by Womens Strike, a womens rights initiative. They come amid a deepening standoff between angry demonstrators and Polands deeply conservative government, which pushed for last Thursdays court ruling and has vowed not to back down. Opinion polls show a majority of Poles oppose the constitutional courts ruling and the protesters have even found support from unexpected groups, including farmers and miners.Another opinion poll on Wednesday showed falling support for the Law and Justice party.I am so furious! They have no right to decide about my life, about my personal decisions, about my future, Julka Wojciechowska, 19, a student protesting in Warsaw, said. They dont understand young people. They dont understand the world now, but they are trying to regulate our lives. We will never allow that.Daily protests since Polands constitutional court issued its decision have exposed deep divisions in this central European nation of 38 million, long a bastion of conservative Catholicism and now undergoing rapid social transformation.Rage over the ruling, which would deny legal abortions to women even in cases of fatal birth defects, has been directed at the Roman Catholic Church and ruling party leader Kaczynski.Kaczynski has said in the past that pregnancies involving even fetuses that are badly damaged and have no chance of survival outside the womb should still end up in a birth, so that the child can be baptized, buried, have a name. On Sunday, women entered Polish churches on Sunday to disrupt Masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings.Kaczynski accused protesters of seeking to destroy Poland late Tuesday and called on his partys supporters to defend churches at any cost.On Wednesday, people heeded that call, gathering outside churches and singing religious songs, in hopes of drowning out the obscenity-filled chants of protesters.Some saw Kaczynskis words as an incitement to violence. The 71-year-old also holds the job of deputy prime minister in charge of police and security services.Donald Tusk, a former prime minister and European Union leader who is a harsh critics of Kaczynski, called for the countrys current leaders to step back from their confrontation with their people.Poland is the worst prepared country for the autumn epidemic wave in the entire European Union, Tusk said. While others were getting ready for the war against the virus, you -- for the war against the nation. Withdraw from it before some tragedy occurs. The conservative rulers have sought to depict the huge crowds of mostly young people led by womens rights activists as fascists.Left-wing fascism is destroying Poland, read a Tuesday headline on state TV.Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski on Wednesday vowed decisive action by the police in the face of further attempts of similar acts of aggression and desecration announced by the leaders and organizers of the protests.He said 76 people were detained in connection with the protests at churches, and prosecutors are carrying out proceedings in 101 cases. People have been taking to the streets in massive numbers even as the coronavirus spreads fast, with a record 18,820 new cases and 236 new deaths over the past day. Polish President Andrzej Duda, who is in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, said he was saddened by the situation in the country. He said he was pleased last week with the courts ruling but added that he understands the protesting women. I am very troubled by this situation, Duda, who is allied with the ruling party, told Polsat News.Monika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed.","The article discusses widespread protests in Poland following a controversial court ruling that bans abortions in cases of fetal abnormalities. This ruling, issued by Poland’s constitutional court, effectively imposes a near-total abortion ban, as the country already had one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws. The decision has sparked intense public outcry, with protests erupting across the nation, including in major cities like Warsaw, Krakow, and Wroclaw. Many protesters are calling for the resignation of the ruling government, led by the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS).

The protests, organized largely by the Women’s Strike movement, have seen tens of thousands of people participating, even defying pandemic-related restrictions. There has been broad opposition to the ruling, with some surprising supporters, including farmers and miners. Despite this, the government, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, remains firm in its stance and has accused opposition leaders and protesters of inciting unrest.

Tensions have escalated, with protests extending to Polish embassies abroad, and demonstrations targeting the Catholic Church, which has supported the court’s decision. Some protesters disrupted church services, which further fueled confrontations. Kaczynski has called for his supporters to defend churches, leading to concerns about the potential for violence.

The protests reveal a deep divide in Polish society, reflecting both the strength of conservative Catholic values and the growing demand for more progressive social policies. While the protests continue, they also expose a broader dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of the pandemic and the increasing authoritarian tendencies within the ruling party."

After delivering a coffin to Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeaus doorstep, the caravan returned to Parliament where 36 women chained themselves to their seats in the public gallery, shouting Abortion on demand until the house was adjourned the first time such a disruption had ever occurred. But it was not a moment that registered in the national consciousness. It wasnt considered a significant event, a part of history, writes Karin Wells, who created a CBC Radio documentary about the Abortion Caravan in 2010 and who brings to her book a documentary makers vivid characterization and exquisite attention to detail. With engaging prose rich with humour, Wells sets the scene a caravan of three vehicles, including a Volkswagen van with the coffin on top, first for the symbolism between 1,000 and 2,000 women in Canada died each year from unsafe abortions but also as a convenient place to store their sleeping bags. The women were all white and it never occurred to anyone at the time to wonder why Black and Indigenous women were missing. But otherwise this was a motley crew, each woman with a different background and motivation for taking part. They were united by the idea that Canadas abortion laws abortions were subject to the approval of a committee were as unjust as they were dangerous. Wells shows that the caravan was a product of the political scene at Simon Fraser University but was also connected to a wave of student uprisings across Europe and the U.S., including the civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War. One perfect moment in the book has a caravan member going into a corner store for chocolate and cigarettes and reading news of the Kent State killings on the front page of the Sudbury Star. The caravan grew in size as it crossed the prairies under RCMP surveillance, entering Ontario via the Trans-Canada Highway, which was still being paved. Along the way, it stopped in towns and cities, the women sleeping on church basement floors. The United Church of Canada had been rallying around the abortion issue for a decade. Typesetters were on strike that spring, so getting the word out through the newspapers was difficult, but news spread through grassroots organizing and phone trees. When officials refused to meet the caravan upon its arrival in Ottawa, the women decided to take over Parliament. Women working in MPs offices forged passes so caravan members poet Bronwen Wallace now among them could enter the House of Commons, all of them costumed in middle-class clothing raided from local second-hand stores. It was a spectacle. From the vantage of 2020, it is easy to underestimate the significance of the Abortion Caravan. It took another 18 years for substantive change to Canadas abortion laws to take effect, and even today access to abortion remains a challenge in many parts of the country. But Wellss powerful book affirms that such ongoing obstacles to womens autonomy and reproductive rights are why the Abortion Caravan matters more than ever. We needed brave, badly behaved women back then, she writes, and we always will.

This protest, known as the Abortion Caravan, became a significant act of defiance, despite not initially being recognized as a major historical event.

The caravan consisted of women with diverse backgrounds, all united by the shared belief that Canada’s abortion laws—where access was subject to a committee’s approval—were both dangerous and unjust. Wells uses vivid, documentary-style writing to describe the caravan’s journey, which included 36 women chaining themselves to their seats in the Canadian Parliament, demanding “Abortion on demand.” This act disrupted the parliamentary session for the first time in Canadian history.

The protest began as a grassroots movement, fueled by political activism at Simon Fraser University and inspired by global student uprisings, the civil rights movement, and anti-Vietnam War protests. The caravan grew as it crossed the country, drawing attention through word-of-mouth and local church support, despite media limitations due to a typesetters’ strike.

Upon arrival in Ottawa, when authorities refused to meet with them, the women decided to take over the House of Commons, entering in disguise with passes forged by women working in MPs’ offices. The protest highlighted the widespread frustration with the country’s restrictive abortion laws, which were not reformed until nearly two decades later.

Wells’ book underscores the importance of the Abortion Caravan, emphasizing its role in the broader fight for reproductive rights. While abortion access remains challenging in many parts of Canada, the caravan’s legacy serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for women’s autonomy and the importance of activism. Wells concludes that brave, defiant women have always been needed in the fight for change, and that necessity persists today.

The book is a powerful tribute to these women and an important reflection on the challenges and triumphs of the reproductive rights movement in Canada."

Photo by Kimberly Marie Kimble Opinion With Trump appointing anti-abortion judges, the fight for reproductive freedom is critical Street Roots Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregons director urges Oregonians to remain united against the White Houses harmful policies by Emily McLain 10 Aug 2020 Donald Trump has broken plenty of campaign promises, but this summer, we were reminded of one that he kept. He pledged to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade and he has been making good on that promise. Trump has spent the past four years pushing policies that threaten our health, our rights and our lives. He and his right-wing allies are putting our lives at risk every single day they are in office, and Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon is committed to doing everything we can to vote them out in November. As the nation grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and stands up to state-sponsored violence against Black people, its clearer than ever the public wants engaged, competent leaders who will work to keep us safe and increase healthcare access not undermine it. We know we can win this. Weve done it before, and we will do it again. Emily McLain is executive director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon.Courtesy photo Just look at 2018, when our collective power brought in a sea change, radically shifting whos in office. We elected the first pro-reproductive health majority to the U.S. House of Representatives, and here in Oregon, we soundly defeated the anti-abortion Ballot Measure 106. But, all of those achievements could be undermined by judges who will affect our rights for generations to come. Since 2016, the courts have often become the last and sometimes only line of defense against dangerous and unconstitutional attacks on basic rights. Yet Trump has remade the federal courts with judges hostile to the right to access sexual and reproductive health care. To date, he has appointed nearly 200 judges to the federal bench, with 20 of the federal judiciary appointed by his administration. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly struck down an anti-abortion law in Louisiana that was identical to a Texas law that was ruled as unconstitutional four years earlier. The Louisiana law would have forced abortion providers to obtain local hospital admitting privileges, a medically unnecessary move meant to make abortion more difficult to access. Surprisingly, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the majority not because hes newly supportive of abortion rights, but because he felt bound by the Texas precedent. While access is protected for now, more than a dozen other abortion lawsuits are one step away from the court. These cases include a dangerous Arkansas law that would ban medication abortion, as well as a deeply unethical policy by the Trump-Pence administrations Office of Refugee Resettlement that seeks to prevent young, undocumented women in government custody from accessing abortion. And its not just abortion. All reproductive care is on the docket. Last month, the Supreme Court upheld Trump administration rules that allow employers and universities to push their religious or moral beliefs on employees and students by denying them access to insurance that covers birth control. Birth control should not be controversial. Nearly nine in 10 women will use it in their lifetimes. It is essential, time-sensitive care that treats serious conditions and allows people to plan if and when they get pregnant. IN OREGON Reproductive rights prevail even as pandemic limits some services This year marks not only the 100th anniversary of womens right to vote, but also the 60th anniversary of the FDAs approval of the first birth control pill. Since that historic moment, access to birth control has been responsible for one-third of womens wage gains relative to mens. The ability to get the pill before age 21 has been found to be the most influential factor enabling women already in college to stay there. The Affordable Care Acts birth control benefit expanded contraceptive coverage with no out-of-pocket costs for more than 62 million women. Now, because of the Supreme Courts ruling, many of their health plans may no longer cover birth control based on the personal objections of bosses and universities. On top of that, the Trump administration has dismantled Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. It has pushed ineffective abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. It has denied care to immigrants. It has gagged Title X health providers and forced Planned Parenthood health centers out of the federal program that provides affordable reproductive health care to people with low incomes. OPINION Adding a citizenship question to census an attack on immigrant health care Opening the door to reduced health care access would have been a mistake in any environment. But as we struggle against the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and systemic racism, the dire implications of this decision are clearer than ever. Our ability to control our own bodies and futures lie in jeopardy like never before. Fortunately, Oregonians have elected leaders and have passed landmark laws that will safeguard us from many of Trumps harmful policies. Thats why we must remain vigilant to continue holding politicians accountable for their records targeting our health, rights and safety.

LEARN MORE","The opinion piece, written by Emily McLain, Executive Director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, discusses the critical importance of defending reproductive rights amidst the judicial appointments made by President Trump. McLain highlights that Trump, despite breaking many campaign promises, has consistently followed through on his vow to appoint anti-abortion judges, reshaping the federal courts with nearly 200 appointments, including 20 to the federal judiciary. These judges threaten to erode access to reproductive health care, including abortion, birth control, and other critical services.

McLain underscores the dangers posed by current legal challenges, such as an Arkansas law seeking to ban medication abortion and a Trump administration policy preventing young, undocumented women in government custody from accessing abortion. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to uphold Trump administration rules that allow employers to deny contraceptive coverage based on religious objections is also a major concern. This decision could undermine essential health care for millions of women.

The piece also reflects on the broader impact of these policies, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racial injustice. McLain points out that the Trump administration has worked to dismantle key healthcare protections like the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid, hindered access to reproductive care through Title X restrictions, and pursued abstinence-only education.

However, McLain offers a hopeful note for Oregon, where voters have passed progressive laws that protect reproductive rights despite federal setbacks. She emphasizes the need for continued vigilance in holding political leaders accountable to safeguard the health, rights, and safety of individuals, particularly in the face of ongoing political and legal attacks on reproductive freedom."

McLain contextualizes these threats within broader social issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustice, noting how the Trump administration has also worked to dismantle vital healthcare protections like the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, imposed restrictions on Title X funding, and promoted abstinence-only education.

Despite these setbacks, McLain highlights Oregon as a hopeful example, where progressive state laws continue to protect reproductive rights, even in the face of federal opposition. She calls for continued vigilance and accountability from political leaders to ensure that individuals’ health and rights remain protected against ongoing legal and political attacks on reproductive freedom."

The protests were organized by Hoosier Jews for Choice, Indiana NOW, and MADVoters. Devan Ridgway, WTIU News A crowd gathered outside the Monroe County Courthouse Monday night, joining statewide protests of the near-total abortion ban that was set to take effect Tuesday. Jessica Marchbank is the director of All Options Pregnancy Resource Center, which helps pay peoples abortions expenses, along with other services like The Hoosier Diaper Program. She attended Mondays demonstration and the one last September, when Indiana became the first state to pass a ban with Senate Enrolled Act 1. Read more Indiana's near total abortion ban was set to take effect Aug. 1. Here's what you need to know Between September of 2022 and Monday, I feel like the energy was similar, but maybe even a little bit more, because people have already lived through one week of a ban, Marchbank said. For the last year, a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality put the ban on hold. Image from September 2022's demonstration in Monroe County. Devan Ridgway, WTIU News The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban didnt violate Indianas constitution, which meant it would go into effect August 1st. That is, until the ACLU filed a petition for rehearing petition Monday, which the state court must now address. Lack of abortion access But for Marchbank, Indianas ban is effectively in place, as Planned Parenthood and other clinics across the state stopped providing abortions. Read more Planned Parenthood halts abortions in Indiana ban has not yet taken effect So it's not like they would suddenly be able to start today or tomorrow, Marchbank said. Her office was quiet Tuesday morning, receiving no new requests for help to fund abortions, despite the ban still being on hold. The center normally funds 20 abortions per day and communicates with 20 to 40 people. Shes not surprised. Calls dropped off briefly last year when the ban first passed last year but picked up again quickly. The fiscal year 2022 to 2023 saw nearly three times the call volume from the year before. The numbers have definitely dropped way down starting Monday. That may just be people aren't sure that they can contact us or what their options are. Marchbank prepares diaper orders Tuesday morning for program participants. Devan Ridgway, WTIU News But now All Options wont be funding anyone to travel into Indiana for abortions, which made up about 10 percent of its clients before, according to Marchbank. Marchbank said clients have been more confused and anxious over the last year. Even after we say There are clinics available to you, we can help. It's okay. There's still kind of the response of, But I don't know how I'm going to pay for it. Marchbank assures clients her organization is ready to help pay. She advises clients not to focus on the sticker price clinics list to them, and for All Options to help, clients need to have an appointment on the books. She makes recommendations of clinics available to someone based on their location and gestation period. Theres a response of, But I can't find an appointment anywhere. And that has sort of been the common thread for hundreds of people who have contacted us this month. The ACLU of Indianas Rehearing Petition That was the point of the ban, Senator Shelli Yoder said, and the exemption if a pregnant persons serious health or life are at risk leaves too much room for interpretation. A bill that is really intended to control people will innately have questions and cause confusion and chaos. Thats part the ACLUs rehearing petition. IU humans rights and legal expert Shruti Rana said, the courts ruling protects the right to abortion when the pregnant persons life is at risk or theres serious health risk. Thats different from the bans language, which said a pregnant person can obtain an abortion where it's necessary to prevent death or serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function. Those are two different phrases, Rana said. It's unclear how they interact. I would also note that the language that's in the Indiana abortion ban is not a medical term, it's not a legal term. Which makes it hard for medical and legal professionals to determine what it means. Rana said the state supreme court can choose to do a few things deny the petition without addressing its question, address it in the petition hearing and resolve some of the ambiguity, it could pass the ACLUs question to another court or forum, or it could modify the pause on the ban. Rana discusses the rehearing petition at the Maurer School of Law. Devan Ridgway, WTIU News She said while petitions for rehearing are common, the stakes are high in this case. Doctors usually don't wait and let a patient's condition deteriorate. They try to intervene at the first moment, Rana said. I think one way of interpreting what we're seeing from the Indiana Supreme Court is that the it is uncomfortable with reducing the right to privacy so far, that a woman doesn't have a right to preserve her own life. The rehearing is unlikely to change the outcome of the ban going into effect soon, though IU legal experts say the ban will probably face other challenges. The ban cant take effect until the Supreme Court answers the ACLUs petition, which could happen at any time. Another suit against SEA 1, claiming the law infringes on the plaintiffs deeply held religious beliefs, will be held in December. Marchbank wants people to know her center is still open and serving people. TagsAbortion banSupport independent journalism today.

We can't do it without you. hey","Uncertainty surrounds Indiana’s near-total abortion ban as it faces ongoing legal challenges. The state’s ban, passed in September 2022, was initially blocked due to a lawsuit questioning its constitutionality. In June 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the ban did not violate the state’s constitution, allowing it to take effect in August. However, the ACLU filed a petition for rehearing, which the court must address, delaying the ban’s implementation.

Despite the ban being on hold, organizations like All Options Pregnancy Resource Center have stopped funding abortions, and clinics, including Planned Parenthood, have ceased services in anticipation of the ban. This has caused confusion among those seeking abortions, with calls to centers like All Options sharply decreasing. Many clients express uncertainty about their options, even with assurances of financial assistance for procedures.

The legal uncertainty is compounded by ambiguities in the ban’s language, particularly regarding exceptions for health risks. Legal experts note that the language used is unclear and not medically defined, making it difficult for doctors to interpret. The Indiana Supreme Court could either deny the petition, clarify the ban’s provisions, or pass the issue to another court.

While the rehearing petition is unlikely to prevent the ban from taking effect soon, further legal challenges are expected, including one regarding religious freedom. Additionally, a suit based on deeply held religious beliefs will be heard in December. Despite these challenges, centers like All Options remain open, continuing to provide services, though their operations are significantly impacted by the ongoing legal battle."

Now, as Roe v Wade faces its most serious threat in decades, Muslim Americans, like many others across the US, have been contemplating what overturning that decision could mean for womens reproductive rights and access to safe abortions.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Abortion Will the US Supreme Court overturn Roe v Wade in 2022?list 2 of 3The US war on abortion rights will harm women everywherelist 3 of 3US abortion rights at stake as Supreme Court takes up key caseend of list Aliza Kazmi, co-executive director of HEART, a national organisation that focuses on sex education in the Muslim community, said reproductive access and choice including safe abortion care is already limited or non-existent for many in the US, namely people of colour and low-income people. We know that many Muslim women are already being pushed away given how health inequities impeding abortion access exist and persist including due to Islamophobia, anti-Blackness, homophobia, transphobia, heteropatriarchy, Christian supremacy, etc. within the provision of health services, Kazmi told Al Jazeera in an email. Should Roe v. Wade be overturned, this narrowing would devastate a majority of people in this country, she said. Supreme Court case Last year, alarm bells sounded about the future of abortion rights in the US when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a Mississippi case, Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization. The case centres on the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi state law that banned abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. While a decision is expected around the middle of the year, the Supreme Courts conservative majority appears ready to weaken or overturn Roe v Wade, paving the way for dozens of states to restrict or ban abortion entirely. A Texas law that prevents abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and allows private individuals to sue providers and anyone who aids them after that period has also raised concerns, pushing tens of thousands to protest across the US last year. The Supreme Court declined to intervene in the case three times, most recently in December, effectively continuing the ban while allowing lower courts to debate it. The case has been sent to the Texas supreme court, thus delaying proceedings. But ultimately, all eyes are turned to the Mississippi case and its potentially historic implications for American women of all races and religions. Islamic law For decades, discourse among Muslim scholars and jurists centred on the premise that there is no clear prohibition of abortion in Islam, and that many agree that a womans life should be prioritised over an unborn fetus. Islamic law, also known as Sharia, is not static or monolithic it has evolved over time in response to cultural, social, and political contexts and societal changes, to stay relevant to Muslims. On reproductive and sexual health, it offers a wide range of rulings, which can vary from extremely restrictive, to more flexible or permissive on questions of birth control, family planning, abortion, pregnancy, and assisted reproductive technology that helps with infertility, such as in vitro fertilisation IVF. Among various schools of thought and religious communities, there can be a very wide diversity in how certain issues are interpreted and abortion is one of those topics. Fiqh Islamic jurisprudence scholars have given a range of time during which they said it is appropriate for a Muslim to have an abortion from a few weeks to a few months. But the key reason they said the procedure is allowed at all is that verses in the Quran the Islamic holy book indicate that a fetus is not a life until the soul is breathed into it that does not happen at conception, but at some later time. Abortion rights advocates hold cardboard cutouts of Supreme Court justices File Jose Luis MaganaAP Photo Jonathan C Brown, a professor of Islamic civilisation at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, said, The process of a life being created extends from 40 days to 120 days, when ensoulment occurs. Some schools of law at various times have been more restrictive, saying that, regardless of when it happens, abortion is not allowed except in necessity if the mothers life is endangered, Brown told Al Jazeera. The second approach goes off the later date of ensoulment and is much more flexible for anything before 120 days. More conservative scholars of Islamic law said that after 120 days, abortion is prohibited, except in a case where the mothers life is in danger. Abortion after 120 days, some Muslim community members say, amounts to murder. The Texas and Mississippi laws, the conservative scholars have argued, are not far from what scholars with the most expansive interpretations would have allowed. In early December 2021, seven Muslim American organisations, including HEART, published a letter arguing that Muslims must oppose the abortion ban. Some Muslims disagreed with their position, including Ihsan Bagby, associate professor in the department of Islamic Studies at the University of Kentucky. Speaking at a webinar also in December, Bagby argued that Muslims should not be publicly behind either side of the argument. The Islamic view is in the middle, and we should stick to it. We dont need to be cheering on the women have a right to their body, as if its an absolute right, and we dont need to be on the right of the pro-life people, because their intentions are to make abortions illegal across the board in all situations, Bagby said. Bagby cited a non-written consensus made by the Fiqh Council of North America, an association of Islamic scholars, that abortion should be allowed up to 120 days, basing it on an authentic hadith about when ensoulment occurs. Before that its a life, after that, it becomes a human and killing it is the same or approximate to the killing of a human. I dont think we should give that up, Bagby said. Religious freedom The imminent threat to Roe v Wade has elicited concern from many religious communities, including some Muslims who fear the decision will affect 26 states that have abortion bans ready to go. Muslims live in all of these states, and a few in particular Michigan, Texas, Florida and Ohio have very large Muslim populations. This will not only impact Muslim womens reproductive rights but the rights of all Muslims who have reproductive lives all Muslims with uteruses, said Sahar Pirzada, West Coast programming and advocacy manager at HEART. This decision could restrict the religious freedom of Muslims given that Islam makes space for reproductive choice, she told Al Jazeera. A majority of Americans 54 percent believe that abortion should be legal, according to estimates from a 2018 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. While the anti-abortion rights perspective on abortion has been predominant in US public debate, the same poll showed that only 45 percent of all Christians think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Adherents of other faiths also show similar, if not more robust, support for abortion rights 70 percent of Jews, 69 percent of Buddhists, and 62 percent of Hindus support a womans right to abortion, for example. According to the same 2018 poll, a majority of Muslims, 51 percent, said they supported legal access to abortion in all or most cases. People attend the March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington, DC, January 21, 2022 Susan WalshAP Photo But the Texas and Mississippi laws were motivated by a particular Christian view that forbids all abortion, said Asifa Quraishi-Landes, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specialises in comparative Islamic and US constitutional law. I, and many women of religious minorities who dont happen to agree with the restrictive Christian view that life begins at conception, are concerned that the Christian Right is trying to use the legislative power of democracy to impose their view of abortion on everyone else, she told Al Jazeera in an email. Quraishi-Landes also stressed that the rules of Islamic jurisprudence are not the only thing to consider in a Sharia worldview. There is also what is known as siyasa the law of the ruler or state which is based not on scriptural interpretation, but rather on maslaha amma the public good. A state law banning abortion does not serve the general public good because it could cause serious harm to a lot of people e.g. women dying from botched self-abortions, she said. Muslims should not support it. To do so would be to support the legislation of ones individual religious views on others, and I believe that Muslim history shows that Muslims are better than that.

Wade decision. This Supreme Court ruling, which legalized abortion across the U.S. nearly 50 years ago, faces its greatest challenge as conservative forces push to restrict or overturn it. Muslim American communities, like many others, are concerned about the potential implications for reproductive rights.

Aliza Kazmi, a leader at HEART, a national organization focusing on sex education in the Muslim community, emphasized that abortion access is already limited for marginalized groups, including people of color and low-income individuals, and that overturning Roe v. Wade would exacerbate these disparities. Additionally, Muslim women face compounded challenges due to factors like Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination.

The article also explains the varying Islamic perspectives on abortion. While some Muslim scholars have no clear prohibition against abortion, opinions vary regarding the time frame within which it is allowed, often depending on the concept of “ensoulment” (when the fetus is believed to be granted a soul). Some scholars allow abortion up to 120 days of pregnancy, while others argue that abortion is only permissible if the mother’s life is at risk. There is no unified stance on the issue, with debates over when life begins and whether abortion is justifiable under certain conditions.

Several Muslim American organizations, including HEART, have publicly opposed abortion bans, calling for Muslims to support reproductive rights. However, some figures, like Ihsan Bagby, suggest a more neutral stance, advocating for a position that respects both the sanctity of life and the need for flexibility in the case of abortion.

The potential overturn of Roe v. Wade also raises concerns about the broader implications for religious freedom, particularly among Muslims in states like Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Ohio, where large Muslim populations reside. Many Muslims worry that the push for restrictive abortion laws reflects a Christian viewpoint that may infringe upon the reproductive rights of religious minorities who do not share that perspective.

Ultimately, the article highlights a division within the Muslim community, with some advocating for the protection of abortion rights and others maintaining a more cautious or conservative view. It also underscores the broader concern that the imposition of specific religious views on the legality of abortion could undermine the rights of all individuals, especially women."

In many states, abortion providers and advocates are challenging state abortion bans contending that the bans violate the state constitution or another state law. These challenges generally fall into three categories Broad Constitutional Challenges In Ohio, Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah, among others, the abortion ban challenges include claims that state constitutional protections, such as liberty, due process, and privacy rights encompass a right to abortion. Health Care Amendment Challenges Some state constitutions were amended to include a right to make health care and health insurance decisions in an effort to block the ACAs individual coverage mandate. In Wyoming and Ohio, abortion advocates argue that this amendment includes the right to make a decision about whether or not to have an abortion. Religious Freedom Challenges In Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah, and Wyoming people from various religious backgrounds argue abortion bans either unduly infringe on their religious exercise or violate state constitutional protections against the establishment of religion. A number of state courts have responded favorably to many of these arguments and have temporarily blocked several bans while litigation on their constitutionality is ongoing. In time, these challenges will reach each states highest court, which will be the ultimate arbiter of the constitutionality of state-level abortion bans. Introduction Since the Supreme Courts decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the legal landscape at the state level has been activated as never before. With the aim of restricting access to abortion, many states moved swiftly to lift court orders previously blocking bans, revive dormant pre-Roe bans, certify trigger bans, and enact new laws. Lacking federal protections, abortion providers have been on the front lines challenging these bans in state courts, questioning their constitutionality, not under the United States Constitution, but under each states constitution. Since the Dobbs decision, 23 states have tried to implement a complete ban or a pre-viability ban. In 6 states, these laws are currently blocked by courts. For an overview of the current legal status of abortion across the country, please see our abortion dashboard. Although State Constitutions are similar to one another in many respects, each state has its unique judicial history and binding precedent, with State Supreme Court rulings diverging on liberty, privacy, and due process protections. Additionally, some states have amended their constitutions to include different abortion protections, while others have moved to assert that their constitution confers no right to abortion. Given these differences, abortion bans and restrictions that may be unconstitutional in some states, may be constitutionally permissible in others. As a result, the types of challenges on state constitutional grounds have varied in states banning or attempting to ban abortion access, including those where the question of a constitutional right to abortion had never reached their highest courts, the ultimate arbiters of the constitutionality of state laws. Despite the variety in the types of legal challenges to abortion bans, a few patterns in the approaches have emerged in the abortion litigation landscape. In this issue brief, we present an overview of some of the types of challenges presented in state courts since the Dobbs ruling in June 2022 and highlight some of the novel strategies that are being used to defend access to abortion in states that have enacted abortion bans. Background Before the Supreme Court of the United States SCOTUS Dobbs decision, the supreme courts of ten states had recognized a constitutional right to abortion in their states constitutions, but often under differing guarantees and protections. For example, in Montana in 1999, the states highest court found that the state constitution contained stringent protections of the right to privacy, exceeding those provided by the federal constitution, and, as such, ruled that procreative autonomy the right to decide whether or when to have children is protected under the right to privacy. Florida and Minnesota are two other states where the highest courts have ruled that their states constitutions include a more expansive right to privacy than SCOTUS had found in the federal constitution. In Massachusetts, the states highest court recognized that the right to abortion is found within the state constitutional due process rights. Currently, nine state supreme court decisions finding state constitutional protections for abortion are binding precedent and have not been overturned by a subsequent decision or constitutional amendment. Table 1. Just as SCOTUS overturned Roe, state supreme courts may overturn their previous decisions upholding the right to abortion in their state constitutions. In 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court found that the state constitutional rights of due process and equal protection encompassed the right to abortion. However, in June 2022, the Iowa court reversed itself, finding that the state constitution confers no fundamental right to abortion. While a states highest court has final say about the constitutionality of laws under its constitution, the legislature and electorate may amend the constitution at a future date, rendering previous court decisions moot or severely impacting the landscape of litigation in that state. For example, in 2000 the Tennessee Supreme Court issued a decision finding the states constitutional protections for privacy encompassed a right to abortion. However, in 2014, voters approved a ballot measure amending the states constitution and explicitly expressing that the constitution did not confer a right to abortion, superseding the 2000 courts ruling. In addition to Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and West Virginia Table 2 have passed ballot measures to amend their state constitutions to curtail the right to abortion. Although these amendments may not explicitly prohibit abortion in the state, they can prevent the state supreme courts from ruling that other, broader constitutional protections encompass a right to abortion. This allows state legislatures to enact abortion bans and restrictions with the confidence that the states highest court will not find them unconstitutional and unenforceable. After the Dobbs decision, some states used ballot measures to attempt to amend their constitutions. The ballot measures seeking to curtail the right to abortion in Kansas and Kentucky failed, while California, Michigan, and Vermont Table 3 successfully passed constitutional amendments recognizing a right to abortion. Enshrining these rights in the state constitution amounts to a much stronger, more stable protection than simply enacting laws recognizing such a right, which can be repealed with a change in party control of a state legislature. In contrast, a constitutional amendment that explicitly protects a right to abortion, or reproductive autonomy more broadly is much harder to change or repeal. Challenges in State Courts Following the Dobbs Decision Who is challenging the abortion bans in state courts? Most legal challenges to state abortion bans are being brought by abortion care providers and clinics, presenting claims on behalf of themselves, their staff, and their patients. This is common in lawsuits regarding the right to access abortion care. Many prominent cases, such as Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, have been brought by providers and clinics. Although there is a long history of providers and clinics challenging abortion restrictions, officials in some states dispute the legal standing providers have to bring these suits. For courts to be able to hear a case at all there must be a party with a real, concrete injury whose protection depends on an intervention by the Court. Usually, a person can only challenge the constitutionality of a law if it infringes on their own rights, not broadly the rights of others. However, legal challenges to abortion bans and restrictions brought by providers and clinics generally argue there is a constitutional right to receive abortion care and restrictive laws violate this right. In this way, providers argue that the rights of their patients not necessarily their own are being infringed by the bans. This practice of suing to vindicate the rights of a closely related party in this case providers and their patients is called third-party standing. It allows a person or organization to assert the rights of another individual when it is difficult for them to assert their own rights, and the parties interests are closely aligned. Given the time limited duration of a pregnancy, it is difficult for pregnant people to personally challenge abortion restrictions while often facing numerous obstacles including financial limitations, and concerns for privacy and personal safety. For almost 47 years, federal and state courts have permitted doctors and clinics to sue on their behalf. The Supreme Court of the United States established third-party standing for abortion doctors on behalf of their patients in a 1976 decision, Singleton v. Wulff. That case was brought by two doctors challenging the exclusion of abortion in Missouris Medicaid program. Justice Blackmun wrote for the court, aside from the woman herself, the physician is uniquely qualified, by virtue of his confidential, professional relationship with her, to litigate the constitutionality of the states interference with, or discrimination against, the abortion decision. Singleton recognized that women can be fearful to assert their abortion rights out of concern for their privacy. However, since the Supreme Courts decision in Dobbs, some state courts have become more receptive of arguments against providers third party standing. Most notably, in Florida, a state Court of Appeals called into question providers ability to sue on behalf of patients in its decision refusing to block an abortion ban. If the ability of providers and clinics to bring challenges to courts is curtailed, it may be more difficult for these challenges to proceed successfully if only those who are seeking abortion are permitted to sue. In addition to clinics and providers, other individuals and groups have challenged abortions bans. Some recent notable cases include a challenge under the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, where five unnamed women and a Jewish pro-choice organization are contesting the constitutionality of the state ban constitutionality on freedom of religious exercise grounds. This challenge is detailed below. Another notable case is the lawsuit disputing the constitutionality of the Wyomings total abortion ban, where a pregnant woman and a woman of reproductive age, along with two physicians, a clinic, and an advocacy organization are suing the state. This challenge rests on constitutional privacy rights and the right to make health care decisions. And, finally, in Wisconsin, the states Attorney General and Medical Examining Board filed a lawsuit seeking judgment that the states pre-Roe ban is unenforceable, arguing that the ban is incompatible and at odds with the many other abortion statutes the state enacted since the decision in Roe. Types of Challenges General Constitutional Challenges In many states, lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of bans argue that the laws violate due process, liberty, equal protection, or privacy rights, or a combination of these rights. Although the states constitutional protections are similar, state Supreme Courts have diverged in their interpretation of these rights, with some recognizing that certain state constitutional rights are more expansive than their federal counterparts. There is active litigation in Ohio, Oklahoma, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Utah and Wyoming, which include constitutional violations as the part of the basis of their challenges to the states abortion bans. In issuing a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of Ohios abortion ban, the state trial court judge found that the Ohio Constitution includes the right to abortion in the right to liberty and in the Due Course of Law provision which states All courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person or reputation, shall have a remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay. Suits may be brought against the state, in such courts and in such manner, as may be provided by law. The court also relied on the Health Care Amendment to the constitution which is discussed below. In Wyoming, the presiding judge also found that the abortion bans exceptions regarding cases of rape or incest and medical emergencies could be found to be unconstitutionally vague. Judges in both Ohio and Wyoming also found the abortion bans would violate each states equal protection provisions, despite the states arguments that these laws apply to everyone equally. In January 2023, the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down the states 6 -week ban as violating the states constitutional privacy provision. Unlike the U.S. federal constitution, South Carolinas constitution has an explicit right to privacy. While each state court is independent and is not obliged to follow other state court decisions, the South Carolina Supreme Court reviewed the decisions of other state Supreme Courts to inform their own ruling that the right to privacy includes the right to abortion. Ten other states also have an explicit right to privacy in their state constitutions.1 Health Care Amendment Challenges In Wyoming and Ohio, the legal challenges to abortion bans revolve around some of these same constitutional protections most other challenges rely on, but also around each respective state constitutions amendment regarding health care and health insurance. These two states, along with Alabama, Arizona, and Oklahoma2, amended their constitutions in the wake of the passing of the Affordable Care Act ACA, to create a right to make health care and insurance decisions and block the insurance coverage mandate in the federal ACA. By creating a right to make decisions about health care and health insurance, the state legislatures hoped they could secure the individual right to refuse to purchase health insurance and to ensure the right to purchase private health insurance, thereby circumventing the laws individual mandate to obtain insurance. In Wyoming, the constitutional amendment was approved in a ballot measure in the November 2012 elections. This amendment safeguards the right to health care access, broadly giving every adult the right to make his or her own health care decisions. In Ohio, the Health Care Freedom Amendment was approved in a November 2011 ballot measure. This amendment protects the right to purchase health care, stating that no federal, state, or local law or rule shall prohibit the purchase or sale of health care or insurance. Despite the narrow intent of the amendments to block ACA implementation, their broad language has allowed providers and advocates in Ohio and Wyoming to successfully argue that these measures create a general constitutional right to make health care decisions. And abortion, they argue, is health care under any ordinary definition of health care. Thus, providers argue, these amendments protect the right to make health care decisions and then logically protecting the decision about whether to have an abortion, making Ohios 6-week LMP ban and Wyomings total ban unconstitutional. In response, state defendants that oppose abortion rights in both cases argue these health care amendments do not remove a states ability to regulate health care, or outlaw abortion. The state Courts in both states, however, were receptive to the argument that the right to make health care decisions encompasses the right to make decisions about whether to have an abortion and blocked the bans from being enforced. Judges in both courts asserted that, regardless of the intent with which the amendment was passed, the plain meaning of the language used in it likely conferred a right to abortion. In short, the state trial court judges agreed with the argument that abortion qualifies as health care and the general constitutional protection to make health care decisions created by the amendments would make the bans unconstitutional. Both cases are expected to reach each states highest court, where the constitutionality of the bans will ultimately be decided. Religious Freedom Challenges based on State Constitutions and The Religious Freedom Restoration Act Individuals, religious faith leaders and organizations have brought legal challenges in several states including Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Wyoming claiming their states abortions restrictions violate their religious freedom. Some of these litigants base their claims solely on the states constitutions right to freely exercise ones religion, while others are challenging their state abortion restrictions on their states Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Indianas case is the only religious challenge to an abortion ban to date where a court has responded to the state RFRA arguments at hand and evaluated their validity. The plaintiffs in Indiana have based their challenge only on the states RFRA law. The Indiana RFRA law, adopted in 2015, prohibits government action that substantially burdens a persons religious exercise, unless the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Several states have similar laws that are modeled after a 1993 federal law by the same name, which applies only to federal laws, not to state or local laws. Federal and state RFRA laws have been used to challenge laws requiring contraceptive coverage and anti-discrimination laws. Most notably, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was the basis for the lawsuit brought by Hobby Lobby to challenge the contraceptive coverage requirement based on the for-profit corporations religious objections to certain contraceptive methods. In the Indiana case, a group of women and a religious pro-choice organization argue the states abortion ban substantially burdens their religious exercise. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that their respective religions Judaism, Islam, and Unitarian Universalism direct them to obtain abortion care under circumstances that the ban does not allow. This includes situations where the pregnancy jeopardizes the mental health of the pregnant person or their physical health, without necessarily causing serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, as the bans health exception would require. Plaintiffs thus argue that their sincere beliefs would be substantially burdened if the ban went into effect. They further argue that the states right to protect potential life is not a strong enough interest to overcome their religious exercise rights which are protected by Indianas RFRA and bar them from receiving abortion care in situations where their sincerely held religious beliefs would call for them to seek it. On December 2, 2022, the Marion County Superior Court granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the ban from being enforced against the plaintiffs, while the underlying question is resolved. Another Indiana state trial court had already issued an order blocking this ban from being enforced due to a previous challenge to the law, which argued the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution provide a right to privacy that includes the right to determine whether not to have an abortion. The state has appealed both court decisions blocking enforcement of the ban and is requesting the Indiana Supreme Court eliminate the preliminary injunction in the RFRA challenge. Conclusion The fate of the constitutionality of abortion bans and the legal availability of abortion services in states where there are ongoing legal battles will most likely rest on each states highest court. Since SCOTUS issued its decision in Dobbs, the South Carolina Supreme Court has ruled that their state constitution protects the right to abortion. Conversely, a week before Dobbs decision, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned their previous decision, and found that their state constitution does not include any protections for abortion. It will take some time for the other cases underway to reach their respective State Supreme Courts and to have decisions on the states constitutional protections of abortion that will ultimately affect abortion access across the nation.

Wade and returned the power to regulate abortion to individual states. In response, abortion providers and advocates have been challenging state-level abortion bans through state courts, asserting that these bans violate state constitutions. These legal challenges fall into three main categories:
	1.	Broad Constitutional Challenges: Many lawsuits argue that state constitutions protect abortion rights under provisions related to liberty, privacy, or due process. For example, courts in Ohio, Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah have seen challenges claiming that abortion is protected under these state constitutional rights.
	2.	Health Care Amendment Challenges: Some states, like Wyoming and Ohio, have constitutional amendments that protect the right to make health care decisions. Abortion advocates argue that these amendments encompass the right to choose abortion, as abortion is a medical decision. Courts in these states have temporarily blocked abortion bans based on these arguments.
	3.	Religious Freedom Challenges: In states like Florida, Indiana, and Wyoming, some individuals and organizations argue that abortion bans infringe on their religious freedom. This challenge is particularly based on state Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, which protect individuals from government actions that substantially burden their religious practices. In Indiana, for example, religious groups argue that the state’s ban interferes with their religious beliefs about abortion.

Since Dobbs, various state courts have issued temporary blocks on abortion bans while these cases proceed, and the ultimate decisions on the constitutionality of these bans will be made by each state’s highest court. The rulings in these cases will have a significant impact on abortion access and will determine whether states can enforce complete or pre-viability abortion bans. Additionally, some states have sought to amend their constitutions to either protect or restrict abortion rights more explicitly, with states like California and Michigan enacting amendments that affirm abortion rights, while others, such as Tennessee and Arkansas, have passed amendments that limit abortion protections.

Overall, the fate of abortion laws in the U.S. is now in the hands of state courts, with each state interpreting its constitution differently based on local judicial history and amendments. These ongoing legal battles are likely to shape the future of abortion access across the country."

While avoiding taking specific positions himself, Trump said in an NBC interview that if he is reelected he will try to broker compromises on how long into pregnancies abortion should be legal and whether those restrictions should be imposed on the federal or the state level. I would sit down with both sides and Id negotiate something and well end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years, he said. The former president targeted GOP primary rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in his criticism of how the Republican party has handled the issue, calling Floridas six-week ban a terrible thing and a terrible mistake. DeSantis camp hit back on Sunday, taking aim at the former president for saying hed be willing to work with both parties on abortion. Weve already seen the disastrous results of Donald Trump compromising with Democrats over 7 trillion in new debt, an unfinished border wall, and the jailbreak First Step Act letting violent criminals back on to the streets. Republicans across the country know that Ron DeSantis will never back down, tweeted spokesperson Andrew Romeo. Trump also warned Republicans that the party would lose voters by advancing abortion restrictions without exceptions for cases of rape, incest or risks to the mothers life. Other than certain parts of the country, you cant youre not going to win on this issue, he said. Trumps comments made plain the challenge for 2024 Republican presidential primary contenders trying to balance the priorities of their conservative base, for whom the Supreme Courts June 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade was a victory decades in the making, and those of the general electorate, which has consistently supported abortion rights most recently in the 2022 midterms and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this spring. Abortion could also be a pivotal issue this fall in Virginias state legislative elections, which are widely viewed as a barometer of the electorates mood in the lead-up to next years presidential election. Trumps appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices paved the way to the reversal of the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights across the United States through the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. That reversal left abortion rights up to the states, which has led to a patchwork of laws including bans on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy in Florida and Iowa, the first state to vote in the GOP presidential nominating process. Defining campaign issue Abortion rights have been a major fault line in the 2024 Republican primary. Trumps former vice president, Mike Pence, has advocated a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks. DeSantis, Trumps top-polling rival, has touted the six-week ban he signed into law. However, other contenders, including Nikki Haley, have taken more moderate approaches, warning of the political backlash Republicans could face among the broader electorate by pursuing strict abortion restrictions. Trump would not commit to a specific policy preference in the interview. He deflected questions about whether he would support a federal ban and if so, after how many weeks or would rather the issue be left to statehouses. Whats going to happen is youre going to come up with a number of weeks or months, youre going to come up with a number thats going to make people happy, Trump said. Trump said he believed it was probably better to leave abortion restrictions up to the states instead of trying to pass federal legislation on the issue. From a pure standpoint, from a legal standpoint, I think its probably better. But I can live with it either way, Trump said. It could be state or could it federal, I dont frankly care. The intra-GOP debate over abortion took center stage at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering, attended by many of the states leading conservative evangelical activists. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the most vocal Trump critics among the GOP contenders, told reporters Saturday in Iowa that Trump has taken evangelical voters for granted and is waffling on important issues. I think he is looking at the abortion question as not whether its going to win evangelical support, but what thats going to look like down the road, and as he said he wants everybody to like him, Hutchinson said. Asked about federal legislation on abortion, DeSantis continued not to engage on the topic of a national ban, instead pointing to new restrictions in states such as Iowa and Florida. Ive been a pro-life governor. Ill be a pro-life president, DeSantis said. Clearly, a state like Iowa has been able to move the ball with pro-life protections. Florida has been able to move the ball. Pence reiterated his support for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy as a minimum, saying, Its an idea whose time has come. He said Trump and other GOP candidates want to relegate the abortion issue to the states, but I wont have it. Personal for every woman and every man However, other contenders more focused on the general electorate, including Haley the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations have sought to thread the same needle as Trump. Haley on Saturday told attendees at the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Iowa that her beliefs are the hard truth. She said pursuing a federal 15-week abortion ban would have everybody running from us. While Haley opposes abortion, she has emphasized she believes Republicans and Democrats need find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them. This issue is personal for every woman and every man. And we need to treat it that way. I dont judge anyone for being pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life, she said. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on CNN last week that he would be open to signing a federal abortion ban if it represented consensus, while admitting the current setbacks to reaching that consensus within the US Senate and across states. I want all of the 50 states to be able to weigh in if they want to, and what their state laws should be, and then lets see if its a consensus, he said. Democrats, meanwhile, are eyeing abortion as one of the most important issues in the 2024 presidential election. CNN previously reported that President Joe Bidens reelection campaign earlier this month made a digital advertising buy highlighting the positions of Trump and other GOP 2024 contenders on the issue. As Donald Trump visits states where women are suffering the consequences of his extreme, anti-abortion agenda, this ad reminds voters in states that have passed some of the most extreme abortion bans of Trumps key role in appointing conservative justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, Bidens campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement to CNN. This story has been updated with additional information Sunday. CNNs Kate Sullivan, Veronica Stracqualursi, Ebony Davis, Kit Maher and Alison Main contributed to this report.

Wade. Trump, who played a key role in appointing conservative justices that enabled the reversal, criticized the way many Republicans articulate their position on abortion, particularly pointing to state-level restrictions like Florida’s six-week ban as politically damaging. He expressed a willingness to broker compromises between both sides on abortion, aiming for a solution that could gain broader acceptance, though he refrained from committing to a specific policy or timeframe.

Trump argued that the GOP risks alienating voters by pushing for abortion bans without exceptions for cases like rape, incest, or threats to the mother’s life. He suggested that Republicans should prioritize negotiations over rigid policy positions and that it might be more effective to leave abortion laws to the states rather than imposing a federal solution. Despite this, Trump’s approach was criticized by rival GOP candidates, particularly Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who defended his state’s stringent six-week ban, and former Vice President Mike Pence, who advocated for a national ban after 15 weeks. Other Republican contenders like Nikki Haley have called for a more moderate approach to avoid alienating swing voters.

Abortion remains a central issue in the 2024 Republican primaries, with candidates divided between pursuing more restrictive state laws and advocating for national policies. Democrats, including President Joe Biden, have framed abortion as a critical issue in the upcoming election, targeting Trump and other GOP candidates over their stance on the issue, especially as many states have implemented severe abortion restrictions since the Roe v. Wade reversal."

View Issue Archives Subscribe Views The Pro-Life Project Has a Playbook Racial Justice HistoryThe anti-racism campaign is a model for the anti-abortion movement. Andrea Palpant DilleyDecember 21, 2020 Image Illustration by Stuef Creative Source Images Fotosearch Stringer Hulton Archive Staff Getty SHARE postSharelinkemailprint The past four years of American public life have been marked by partisan tension between the pro-life movement and the racial justice cause. Politically, at least, the two have been cleft apart and set at odds. The pro-life campaign is viewed by some as a conservative white mens culture war, while the anti-racism project is seen often as a solely progressive movement. The last election hinged in part on these real and perceived tensions. Future elections will do the same. As philosopher Scott Coley notes, We are forced to choose between the rights of the most vulnerable, namely the unborn, and the rights of all but the most vulnerable, namely immigrants and people of color. Although our politics pit these movements against each other, the two in fact share the same moral nucleus. The anti-abortion cause and the anti-racism cause are sibling abolition movements that protest two different cultures of exploitation and devaluation. What, then, can the pro-life campaign learn from the racial justice project? Since the advent of Roe v. Wade 48 years ago, the reproductive justice movement has embraced a conditional view of human life. The worth of an unborn baby is contingent upon a mothers preparedness, her consent, even her personal interest or desire. The child has value insofar as the mother says it does. Case in point A recent Time essay by Stephanie Land suggests that you can name and love your blastocyst, even if you terminate the pregnancy. By contrast, the largely Christian abolition project of the 19th century was built on the view that all human life has intrinsic value. Todays antiracism movement reflects that same ethic by saying Racial justice is not conditional. Black lives are valuable irrespective of circumstance, irrespective of personal bonds between blacks and whites, and irrespective of anyones interest or awareness although those matter. As Dennis Edwards writes for CT, we dismantle systems of injustice precisely because all of us have been created in the image of God. These principles are almost entirely absent from the pro-choice campaign. Arguably, the entire movement is heir to American slavery. Under the Dred Scott ruling of 1857, a slaveholder decided the value of a black persons body. In a Roe v. Wade world, the mother determines the value of the unborn child. She is the legal owner. The parallels here arent merely symbolicthey point us toward praxis. Free NewslettersGet the best from CT editors, delivered straight to your inbox! More Newsletters First, pro-lifers are fighting for the abolition of abortion, nothing less. The abolitionists of the 19th century were calling for the total and complete end to slavery, not just the overturning of Dred Scott. Similarly, we are calling for the definitive end to abortion on demand. Overturning Roe is a necessary first step. But our cry for justice goes way beyond We want our nations government to outlaw one human being owning another, and we want that ruling to extend to all 50 states. Second, we are fighting to outlaw abortion in order to secure rights for the unborn. Frederick Douglass, the black Christian abolitionist, once asked, Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us blacks? We can pose that same question in the abortion debate. Like the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, and the 14th, which promised citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, we need constitutional amendments that recognize unborn children. As any critic will point out, American politics makes it difficult to bring about the comprehensive justice required to end abortion. In addition to laws, we also need parental leave legislation, poverty alleviation, and a culture of maternal support. Were nowhere near any of those goals. Nonetheless, the persistent blindness of this nation doesnt decrease the moral urgency of declaring the same truth over and over again The child inside the womb has intrinsic value and deserves the same right to life as a child outside the womb. In the book of Isaiah, the prophet calls his people to seek justice and defend the oppressed Isa. 117. That is our timeless mandate. As Tim Keller argues, biblical justice is based on Gods charactera moral absolute, while other philosophies are based on the changing winds of human culture. That moral absolute applies to black lives then and now, just as it applies to the unborn. And that moral absolute is what we carry into the public square, even as it defies the partisan logic of our day. Andrea Palpant Dilley is online managing editor at CT.

It argues that both movements share a similar moral foundation, rooted in the belief that all human life has intrinsic value. While the pro-life movement advocates for the rights of the unborn, the racial justice movement defends the inherent worth of Black lives. Both are framed as abolitionist causes, with the pro-life movement seeking to abolish abortion, akin to how abolitionists fought to end slavery in the 19th century.

The article critiques the pro-choice position, which often assigns value to unborn children based on the mother’s consent or circumstances, drawing a parallel to the dehumanization seen in slavery, where value was determined by the owner. In contrast, the article highlights how racial justice and the abolitionist movement have always championed equality irrespective of personal interests or bonds, advocating for the intrinsic value of all human beings, as established in the Christian tradition.

The author stresses the importance of pushing for not only the overturning of Roe v. Wade but also comprehensive legal and social support, such as parental leave and poverty alleviation. The article calls for constitutional amendments that recognize the rights of the unborn, aligning the pro-life cause with the principles of freedom and justice that were historically extended to Black Americans after slavery. The article concludes with a call to uphold these moral principles in the public sphere, citing biblical teachings on justice and the protection of the oppressed."
"TN abortion ban: 3 women, 2 doctors sue over 'catastrophic' risks","TN abortion ban 3 women, 2 doctors sue over 'catastrophic' risksOpinion Nashville areas population is exploding. A three-hour commute proves itNews Sports Counties Business Music Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals POLITICSThree women sue Tennessee over abortion law they say causes 'catastrophic' risksThe Center for Reproductive Health, a New York-based nonprofit legal firm, represents the women. They are challenging the law under the state constitution. Melissa BrownNashville TennesseanThree Tennessee women who say the state's abortion law endangered their lives sued on Monday, arguing the law is too restrictive and vague about when doctors can legally terminate a pregnancy with serious complications.One woman, 27-year-old Katy Dulong, said she was denied needed health care when she was diagnosed with a pregnancy complication that would cause her lose the pregnancy in November 2022. The hospital denied Dulong medication to induce labor, only providing her sanitary pads to manage a miscarriage at home.When she returned to the hospital a week later, doctors discovered the baby's body was almost entirely in Dulong's vaginal canal and there was no amniotic fluid left. Her doctor spent two hours on the phone to get permission to give her medication to induce, the lawsuit alleges.Dulong was at serious risk for sepsis when she birthed the baby, who died, in a hospital bathroom within an hour of taking the medication to induce labor, according to the lawsuit.Two doctors are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court late Monday evening, which argues Tennessee's law violates the state constitution and asks a judge to clarify the circumstances under which doctors can legally perform abortions.""Vague abortion bans like Tennessees inevitably hinder or delay the delivery of necessary medical care,"" the lawsuit states. ""And, contrary to its stated purpose of furthering life, Tennessees abortion ban exposes pregnant people to grave risks of death, injury, and illness, including loss of fertility making it less likely that every family that wants to bring a child into the world will be able to do so.""The Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based legal firm, represents the Tennessee women and is likely looking to build on its recent Texas lawsuit as a possible blueprint for undercutting abortion restrictions elsewhere.A Texas judge last month temporarily ruled the state's abortion law is too restrictive, staying the law ahead of a full trial, and the legal group announced similar legal filings in Oklahoma and Idaho on Tuesday.Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the Texas lawsuit was the tip of a very large iceberg and sparked feedback from other states, including the plaintiffs in the three lawsuits announced on Tuesday. The CRR announced the filings in a news conference on Tuesday.Theyve each been through unspeakable trauma, Northup said of the plaintiffs. Today, they are holding their state governments accountable for the suffering that their laws have caused.""OpinionAbortion ban has led to an OBGYN shortage. It will be lethal in rural Tennessee Opinion'Pre-Roe v. Wade was not easy'Illegal abortions shaped these Tennessee doctors' careersTennessee's trigger abortion banWhen the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision providing abortion rights nationwide last summer, Tennessee had a law ready to snap into place to end all abortion rights. Referred to as the state's ""trigger"" ban, the law was among the strictest in the nation, one of only three states not to provide legal exceptions for abortions even to save a pregnant patient from death or serious injury.Tennessee Republicans argued a narrow carve-out in the law allowed doctors to save the life of a pregnant patient, but a doctor would have to knowingly commit a felony to do so. Multiple doctors told The Tennessean the risk for legal jeopardy was too high and would negatively affect reproductive health outcomes in the state.The Tennessee General Assembly last spring codified narrow legal exceptions for abortions performed to save the life or prevent serious injury to a pregnant patient. A broader bill, carried by Republican lawmakers, to allow abortions in the event of fatal fetal anomalies failed to advance amid intense anti-abortion lobbying, despite widespread public support for legal abortion rights.The anti-abortion lobbying push was led by Tennessee Right to Life, whose chief lobbyist said earlier this year the law should not allow doctors to subjectively choose when to intervene in high-risk pregnancy conditions, as some conditions will ""work themselves out.""Tennessee physicians like Dr. Laura Andreson, who is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, have for months decried this argument as a fundamental misunderstanding of medical care. Andreson, a Franklin OBGYN, is joined in the lawsuit by Dr. Heather Maune, a Nashville-based OBGYN.Among the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit is Allie Phillips, a Clarksville woman who became pregnant with her second child in November 2022. Phillips feared she could be at high risk for pregnancy complications due to her previous gastric bypass surgery, she told The Tennessean in March, but she and her husband were overjoyed to learn they were having a girl, who they named Miley Rose.At a February anatomy scan, Phillips received the news that her daughter was measuring a month behind developmental schedule. Miley Rose's kidneys were significantly undersized, her heart had developed only two chambers, and there were signs of a deadly condition where the brain isn't correctly formed.It was unlikely Phillips could carry to term and would be at risk for miscarriage and other complications until she miscarried. If the pregnancy lasted to term, the baby was unlikely to survive or would live just a short time on hospice care, something Phillips and her husband did not want to put a child through.The couple made the decision to travel out of state to terminate the pregnancy.Its extremely inhumane to force anybody out of their own home to have to seek health care. Its wrong on so many different levels, Phillips said. The third plaintiff in the lawsuit, 31-year-old Nicole Blackmon, was taking medications to treat a brain tumor-like condition called pseudotumor cerebri when she learned she was unexpectedly pregnant in July 2022. Her pregnancy was high risk due to the condition, and Blackmon was also struggling with mental health issues following the tragic loss of her teenaged son who had died in a drive-by shooting.Doctors decry abortion banWhy doctors are decrying Tennessee's 'dangerous' abortion ban as lawmakers debate changeOther healthcare newsTennessee's transgender health care law What to know about latest legal wranglingIn August 2022, an anatomy scan showed her baby's major organs had developed inside a sac on the outside of the baby's body, indicating a severe fetal development diagnosis of limb-body-wall complex. In later appointments, the diagnosis was confirmed and she was advised to consider an abortion, ""because her baby was no longer receiving nutrients through the placenta, was extremely unlikely to survive to birth, and continuing the pregnancy would put increasing strain on Nicoles body,"" the lawsuit states.Blackmon could not afford the out-of-state medical and travel costs to seek an abortion elsewhere. She continued the pregnancy in Tennessee while developing severe side effects, including headaches, blurred vision and increased blood pressure, which were warning signs of preeclampsia and a potential stroke.She was given medication to induce labor in December 2022 after her water broke at 31 weeks. After 32 hours of labor, she gave birth to a stillborn baby, a boy she named Ethan, and she was diagnosed with a placenta infection, according to the lawsuit.Blackmon on Tuesday called Tennessee's law ""cruel"" and her pregnancy experience ""torture that no one else should ever have to face.""""No one should have to endure the emotional and physical pain, and risk to their life, that I have suffered in Tennessee,"" Blackmon said. ""That law forced me to carry a baby for months that was never going to live, and easily could have killed me.

The lawsuit challenges the law under Tennessee’s state constitution, claiming that its vagueness about when an abortion can be legally performed endangers health and lives. The plaintiffs include Katy Dulong, who suffered complications during a miscarriage, Allie Phillips, who faced a high-risk pregnancy with a fetus showing severe anomalies, and Nicole Blackmon, who had to continue a pregnancy despite serious health risks.

The suit also includes two doctors, Dr. Laura Andreson and Dr. Heather Maune, who argue that the law creates confusion and legal risks for medical professionals, delaying necessary care. The plaintiffs assert that the law, which was enacted after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, forces people to endure life-threatening situations, and violates the constitutional rights of Tennessee residents.

The Center for Reproductive Rights, representing the plaintiffs, views the case as part of a broader effort to challenge abortion restrictions in multiple states. They emphasize that the law causes severe emotional, physical, and financial strain on individuals, forcing them to seek care out of state. The lawsuit has drawn attention to the state’s limited legal exceptions for abortion, which only allow for life-saving procedures but fail to address situations involving serious fetal abnormalities or the health of the pregnant person."

Kristi Hamrick - 18 Feb 2022 Pro-abortion leaders in the nations capital must not be allowed to violate the U.S. Constitution by criminalizing pro-life speech they dont like, said SFLAs Kristan Hawkins. Blocking pro-life students from peacefully chalking Black Preborn Lives Matter is viewpoint discrimination. Its striking that one of the few ways for protestors to get the attention of D.C. officials is not by violence or vandalism, but by voicing love and concern for the preborn. This case is about the constitutionality of government officials taking sides in a public debate, from Frederick Douglass Foundation, Inc., et al. v. District of Columbia, Appeal No. 21-7108 D.C. Cir. WASHINGTON D.C. 02-18-2022 Students for Life of America SFLA and the Frederick Douglass Foundation FDF through their attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom ADF filed an appeal this week in what is now an on-going free speech case against the District of Columbia. Following the violence of Black Live Matter protestors along with city-allowed painting of Black Lives Matter Defunding Police on streets, SFLA and FDF organized a peaceful protest in 2020 to pray, peacefully protest, and paint BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER in temporary paint, as D.C. police advised. Click here to read the ADF filed brief. As the Washington Post reported, police showed up at the event, telling those at the scene that they could not paint or chalk BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER, even though chalking is common practice at such protests. Two students were arrested by police as they began marking on a sidewalk outside of a Planned Parenthood in the nations capital, leading to legal action. Obama appointed U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg dismissed the case first brought, claiming that because police did not have concerns about a violent reaction from the peaceful protestors, applying ordinances against them and not others was understandable. ADF attorney Erin Hawley said The District of Columbia singled out Frederick Douglass Foundation and Students for Life of America for discriminatory treatment based on their pro-life message. The Metropolitan Police Department turned a blind eye towards certain favored speech while shutting down pro-life speech with which it disagreed. This is the essence of viewpoint discrimination and selective enforcement in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. Click here for a video at Breitbart that illustrated D.C. police treatment of pro-life Americans compared to Black Lives Matter protestors. In the appeal, ADF attorneys note It was not until Plaintiffspro-life groups concerned about the hundreds of thousands of unborn Black children killed by abortion each yearrequested a permit to gather and paint their own mural stating Black Pre-Born Lives Matter, that the District rediscovered its Defacement Ordinance It is not enough that the government enact neutral laws it must also enforce them in a viewpoint-neutral way While legitimate distinguishing factors may result in differential enforcement, it is irrational for government to impose greater punishment on speakers who seek to comply with notice and permitting requirements and less on speakers who flaunt those requirements. Similarly, it would be illegitimate to subject small, peaceful demonstrations to more stringent enforcement than large-scale protests complete with the permanent defacement of public and private property. Given the way that D.C. law enforcement ignored the conduct of Black Lives Matter protestors compared to those supporting the BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER message, this is evidence of a policy or practice of enforcing the Defacement Ordinance against speech it disagrees with and not enforcing against speech it prefers, said ADF on behalf of SFLA and FDF. In an opinion piece at Newsweek, Hawkins along with Toni McFadden, formerlyMinority Outreach and Healthy Relationships Director with Students for Life of America,addressed the issues at stake. They observe The issue here is constitutional fairness. Actors, artists, politicians and CEOs have the liberty under the First Amendment to voice support for abortion or omit preborn children from their activism. But governmental entities engage in unconstitutional overreach when they seek to bar pro-life citizens from expressing the position that all Black lives matter, that abortion is violence, and that the Black preborn child deserves protection.

The case stems from an incident in 2020 when SFLA and FDF organized a peaceful protest, painting “BLACK PREBORN LIVES MATTER” in temporary paint on a sidewalk, a form of protest they were advised to use by police. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, two students were arrested, and authorities enforced the city’s defacement ordinances, even though similar protests, such as Black Lives Matter, were not subjected to the same restrictions.

The lawsuit claims that this selective enforcement amounts to viewpoint discrimination, as pro-life messages were targeted, while other forms of speech, including pro-abortion and Black Lives Matter messages, were allowed to proceed without interference. SFLA argues that the District’s actions are unconstitutional, as the government must enforce laws in a viewpoint-neutral manner. This case challenges the broader issue of fairness in the enforcement of laws and highlights concerns over government overreach in suppressing speech it disagrees with.

SFLA, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), argues that the District’s actions discriminate against pro-life groups based on their message. They contend that the city’s selective enforcement is a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, which protect freedom of speech and equal treatment under the law. The case is also seen as part of a larger effort to protect the constitutional rights of pro-life activists who are often marginalized in debates about abortion rights.

The appeal emphasizes that the government cannot favor certain viewpoints, particularly in the context of public protests. It also points to the contradiction in how laws were enforced differently depending on the message, citing the leniency given to Black Lives Matter protests in contrast to the treatment of pro-life demonstrations. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for free speech and protest rights, particularly for groups advocating for controversial views like pro-life activism."
Vatican dismisses Father Frank Pavone from priesthood | Catholic News Agency,"Vatican dismisses Father Frank Pavone from priesthood Catholic News Agency Saturday, March 09, 2024 A service of EWTN News CNA ACI Prensa ACI Stampa ACI Digital ACI Africa ACI Afrique ACI Mena CNA Deutsche NCRegister News Headlines Vatican Americas Asia - Pacific US Europe Middle East - Africa Most Read Archive Resources Abortion Advent Apologetics Benedict XVI Bible Catechism Catholic Links Church Fathers Holy Week Life Family Liturgical Calendar Liturgy Mary Politics Pope Francis Prayers Sacraments Saints Virtue CNA Newsletter Editors Service About Us Advertise Privacy Donate Search Menu Subscribe EWTN News Vatican dismisses Father Frank Pavone from priesthood Father Frank Pavone Credit Priests for Life, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons By Shannon Mullen, Joe Bukuras Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Dec 17, 2022 1705 pm Father Frank Pavone, a well-known pro-life activist and national director of the organization Priests for Life, has been dismissed from the clerical state for blasphemous communications on social media and persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop, CNA has learned. In a Dec. 13 letter to U.S. bishops obtained by CNA and confirmed by multiple sources as authentic, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, wrote that the prefect of the Dicastery for the Clergy issued the decision on Nov. 9, adding that there was no possibility of appeal. Father Pavone was given ample opportunity to defend himself in the canonical proceedings, and he was also given multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop, explains a separate statement attached to Pierres letter. It was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions. Pavone, however, told CNA Saturday that he had not been notified about the Vaticans judgment. The communication from Pierre does not specify the actions that led to Pavones dismissal or name the bishop he disobeyed. The statement refers to Pavone as Mr. Pavone and calls him a lay person, underscoring the dramatic and immediate nature of the Vaticans action. Since Priests for Life, Inc. is not a Catholic organization, Mr. Pavones continuing role in it as a lay person would be entirely up to the leadership of that organization, the statement says. Pavone is still saying Masses, including one streamed online Saturday. The Priests for Life website states that Pavone is a Catholic priest in good standing, and exercises his ministry in full communion with the Catholic Church. In an email to CNA on Saturday, Pavone said that he was not aware of the Vaticans action. How did CNA learn about this before I did? he asked. In a subsequent email he added that CNAs inquiry was the very first communication that came to me about this. It is not clear in what diocese Pavone, 63, is incardinated as a priest. On the Priests for Life website, it says he received permission from the Vatican in 2019 to transfer from the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, where he was incardinated in 2005, to another, unnamed diocese. Pavone hosted the show Defending Life on EWTN for many years until the bishop of Amarillo, Texas, revoked Pavones permission to appear on the Network. EWTN is the parent organization of CNA. A history of clashes with hierarchy Originally based in Staten Island, New York, Priests for Life is now headquartered in Titusville, Florida, within the Diocese of Orlando. That diocese, also, did not respond to CNAs request for comment Saturday. Pavone has served as the pro-life organizations national director since 1993. In that role he has a long history of conflicts with bishops, beginning more than 20 years ago with the late Cardinal Edward Egan of the Archdiocese of New York. Egan succeeded the late Cardinal John J. OConnor, who ordained Pavone in 1988 and encouraged his pro-life work. In his email, Pavone directed CNA to a document posted on his personal website titled Summary of How Fr. Frank and Priests for Life Have Been Treated by Some in the Hierarchy. More in US 8 of the most popular novenas Read article We all expect that the pro-abortion groups, like Planned Parenthood, will target, harass and try to intimidate us. And they do try, he wrote. But when such treatment comes from bishops and other Church authorities which it increasingly does its particularly deplorable, he added. Instead of supporting and encouraging the pro-life work of the Church, some of these men try to obstruct and hinder it, and abuse their authority to try to intimidate priests and laity who make ending abortion the top priority of our lives. Pavone has been at odds with Bishop Patrick J. Zurek in Amarillo since the latter became bishop there in 2008. In 2011, Zurek publicly suspended Pavone, though Pavone later had the suspension overruled by the Vatican. The Amarillo Diocese did not respond to CNAs requests for comment prior to publication. Pavones political activism played a role in his problems in Amarillo. An outspoken supporter of former president Donald Trump, Pavone served on official Trump campaign outreach positions in 2016 and was originally a co-chair of Trumps 2020 pro-life coalition, as well as an advisory board member of Catholics for Trump. Canon law forbids clerics from having an active role in political parties unless they receive the permission of their bishop. In November 2016, Pavone filmed a video at the Priests for Life headquarters, urging support for Trump. The video was staged with the body of an aborted baby laid before Pavone on what appeared to be an altar. Zurek said soon after the videos release that he would open an investigation into the incident, calling it against the dignity of human life and a desecration of the altar, adding that the action and presentation of Father Pavone in this video is not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Church. Story continues below Subscribe to our daily newsletter On his website, Pavone details his version of what happened in the video. He also has posted a transcript of what he said on the video. Much of the criticism revolved around my having placed the baby on an altar and some started getting into technical complaints about what should or should not be done with an altar. But to the extent that they want to get technical, so can I, and I pointed out that this was a table in our office, not a consecrated altar in a chapel, he wrote. That table, sometimes used for Mass, was also the place where all my videos in this educational series of election broadcasts were made, he continued. In retrospect, I should have made the baby video in a different location so as to avoid any confusion to begin with. Pavone wrote in his account that the babys remains were given to him so he conduct a proper burial, which he said he did after making the video. Pavone stepped down from the two positions with Trumps reelection campaign in 2020 at the request of what he called the competent ecclesiastical authority. But he continued to use his social media platforms to advocate for Trump and denounce the Democratic Party. Those posts led to another confrontation with Zurek shortly before the 2020 election. Trending In tweets that were subsequently deleted, Pavone reportedly called then Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden a expletive loser and said the Democratic Party was God-hating and America-hating and that Bidens supporters cant say a expletive thing in support of their loser candidate without using the word Trump. What the hell do you have to say for yourselves, losers? Pavone asked. Pavone also reportedly tweeted that he would hear the confession of a Catholic who votes Democrat, but we are trained that in the absence of repentance, absolution has to be withheld. In response, the Amarillo Diocese issued a statement disavowing Pavones comments, saying he used scandalous words not becoming of a Catholic priest. These postings are not consistent with Catholic Church teachings, the diocese said in its statement. Please disregard them and pray for Father Pavone. Tags Catholic News, Priests for Life, Fr.

The decision, announced in a letter from Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the U.S., was based on Pavone’s blasphemous remarks on social media and persistent disobedience toward his diocesan bishop. The Vatican determined that Pavone had ample opportunities to justify his actions but failed to do so, resulting in his dismissal from the clerical state with no option for appeal.

Despite the Vatican’s decision, Pavone was reportedly unaware of his dismissal when informed by the Catholic News Agency (CNA). The statement from the Vatican refers to Pavone as a layperson, signaling the end of his role as a priest. Pavone has maintained that he is still performing Mass and continues his work with Priests for Life, which is not recognized as a Catholic organization.

Pavone’s conflicts with Church authorities have been ongoing for years. These began with disagreements with the late Cardinal Edward Egan and Bishop Patrick J. Zurek of Amarillo, Texas, particularly over Pavone’s political activism. Pavone, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, faced scrutiny for publicly supporting Trump during the 2016 election and engaging in controversial social media posts. His involvement with the Trump campaign and his use of social media to criticize political opponents, including calling Democrats “God-hating” and “America-hating,” also led to clashes with Church leadership.

Pavone’s actions, including his infamous 2016 video with the body of an aborted baby, sparked significant controversy. Although Pavone defended his actions, claiming it was not a desecrated altar, his behavior was seen as inconsistent with Church teachings and dignity. His political involvement and social media statements led to repeated confrontations with diocesan authorities, including the suspension of his ministry in Amarillo, which was later overturned by the Vatican. Despite these tensions, Pavone continued his political advocacy, further straining his relationship with the Church hierarchy.

The Vatican’s dismissal marks a dramatic and final step in Pavone’s long-standing disputes with ecclesiastical authorities, leaving his future within the Catholic Church uncertain."

However, he also noted that taking such a drug should be avoided.He said, Although the Church has been clear that one may receive such drugs, it is also the case that we have a duty to protest the disturbing fact that aborted materials are still being used in many sectors of biomedical research.Many people and many Catholics are surprised to learn about the widespread and continuing use of these cells in biomedicine and research.Father Pacholczyk, director of education for The National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, stressed that Catholics must vigorously call for drugs developed and tested without cells or tissue from aborted babies.The distinction exists between testing and manufacturing, he said, but for both of these aspects of drug or vaccine development, the use of cell lines from abortions should be avoided as much as possible.Scientists worldwide accelerated research and production of new therapeutic drugs in vaccines to fight COVID-19 since the virus that causes it began its deadly sweep of the planet at the end of 2019.The Food and Drug Administration reported that more than 550 COVID-19 drug development programs were underway as of Oct. 12. Meanwhile, more than 350 drug trials were under review by the FDA.The agency had also authorized five drugs for emergency use, but REGN-COV2 was not yet one of them. Its manufacturer, Regeneron, filed an emergency use authorization request with the FDA on Oct. 7, the same day Trump made his video testimonial about the drug.After the video, media attention over REGN-COV2 vaulted over other similar drugs under development. It thus became public knowledge that the drugs history has a connection to HEK293T. This cell lines origins reach back nearly 50 years ago from kidney cells taken in a Dutch laboratory from an aborted female fetus. The parents identities and the reason for abortion are unknown.HEK293T cells were used to create a pretend virus to test our antibodies against, said Alexandra Bowie, spokeswoman for Regeneron. HEK293T is a doubly-transformed cell line, and we would not classify it as tissue.Bowie told The Tablet on Oct. 12 that HEK293s are considered immortalized cells not stem cells and are a common and widespread tool in research labs.HEK293T wasnt used in any other way, Bowie added, and fetal tissue was not used in this research. We did not use human stem cells or human embryonic stem cells in the development of REGN-COV2.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is based in Tarrytown, Westchester County, New York. Bowie said its scientists have been working tirelessly for nearly the whole year to advance REGN-COV2 in record time for patients impacted by COVID-19.Based on promising early data, she added, we hope this investigational drug will be deemed safe and effective and ultimately help improve human health.Father Pacholczyk explained how Catholics could receive the drug, even though testing was conducted with HEK293T.Quoting from the 2008 Vatican instruction Dignitas Personae n. 35, Father Pacholczyk said, grave reasons may be morally proportionate to justify the use of these products, especially in the absence of alternatives.Grave reasons would, of course, include danger to ones health, allowing us to receive medicines or vaccines developed using cell lines of illicit origin.This is permissible, Father Pacholczyk said, because, in part, one would not be cooperating with the abortion that happened many decades earlier, and one did not have any role in making the decision to use the cell line by the pharmaceutical company.But Father Pacholczyk also noted the same Vatican document declares that Catholics now live in the context of the urgent need to mobilize consciences in favor of life.Alternatives to the use of these cells is critical, he said, and part of the duty of the moment is to increase awareness about the problem.To that end, bishops in the U.S. joined pro-life medical professionals in April to draft a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of ethically produced drugs to fight COVID-19.Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City penned the first signature. He chairs the Committee on Pro-Life Activities for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.We are aware, the letter reads, that among the dozens of vaccines currently in development, some are being produced using old cell lines that are created from the cells of aborted babies.Fortunately, there is no need to use ethically problematic cell lines to produce a COVID vaccine or any vaccine, the letter reads. Other cell lines or processes that do not involve cells from abortions are available and are regularly being used to produce other vaccines.The USCCBs pro-life committee has praised the Trump administration for creating a fetal tissue ethics review board within the National Institutes of Health. Archbishop Naumann applauded the administration in August after the review board recommended against funding for some projects involving fetal tissue research.Last week, however, it was unclear what Trump knew about how HEK293T was used to test the drug he called a cure.Some people dont know how to define therapeutic, he said. I view it differently its a cure.I heard about this drug. I said, Let me take it. It was my suggestion. I said, Let me take it, and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible.Trump said he also tried the antiviral drug Remdesivir, which is approved for emergency use by the FDA, although supplies were limited in mid-October because of testing.Medical experts have said it was premature for Trump to say the drug cured him, noting that Remdesivir couldve played a role. They also noted Trump took the steroid dexamethasone to fight inflammation in his lungs.The president, however, believed REGN-COV2 did the trick. He pledged to win approval for the drug and make it free for everyone, although he provided only a few details about how that would get done.I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great, Trump said. So were going to get you the drug. Its going to be free. Were going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And youll see some amazing things happen.The federal government also recognized the drugs potential in July when it awarded Regeneron 450 million to develop REGN-COV2 as part of Operation Warp Speed the public-private partnership launched to fast-track the development of vaccines and therapeutics to fight COVID-19. The money came from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.Regeneron officials said if REGN-COV2 is OKd for emergency use authorization EUA, the government has committed to making these doses available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for its distribution.The officials made that comment in the companys Oct. 7 EUA request. The document also stated that it had 50,000 doses available.And, the officials added, We expect to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total within the next few months. Catholic bioethicists express concern about attempts to find a COVID-19 vaccine or therapeutics using cell lines created from fetuses aborted nearly five decades ago.

This drug was tested using HEK293T, a cell line with origins tracing back to an aborted fetus in the 1970s. Pro-life Catholics are confronted with whether they should take such treatments, given their connection to abortion.

Father Tadeusz Pacholczyk, a Catholic bioethicist, states that while the Vatican allows the use of drugs tested with these cells in certain cases, such as when no alternatives are available, Catholics should protest the continued use of fetal tissue in biomedical research. He emphasizes that there is a moral duty to promote alternatives that do not rely on such tissue. Additionally, he draws from the Vatican’s 2008 instruction Dignitas Personae, which permits using these drugs in urgent cases where health is at risk, but also calls for advocacy against the use of abortion-derived materials.

The article also covers the broader context of the COVID-19 drug and vaccine development, noting the significant number of trials underway to address the pandemic. Despite the use of HEK293T in testing, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, the maker of REGN-COV2, emphasized that no fetal tissue or embryonic stem cells were used in the actual development of the drug.

Catholic leaders, such as Archbishop Joseph Naumann, have urged the FDA to approve vaccines and drugs that do not rely on ethically controversial cell lines, highlighting that alternatives exist for developing these medical products. President Trump, in his testimony, supported the rapid development and widespread distribution of REGN-COV2, though it remains under evaluation by the FDA.

In conclusion, while pro-life Catholics can use drugs like REGN-COV2 under certain circumstances, the ethical dilemma remains over the use of abortion-derived cells, and there is a push for increased awareness and development of ethically produced alternatives."

Just when Beth and Kyle Long received the worst news of their life, an Ohio law made their searing pain even worse. For four years, the Longs tried to have a baby, enduring multiple rounds of grueling fertility treatments. In September 2022, Beth finally became pregnant. But an ultrasound four months later showed that most of the babys organs were outside the body. The condition, called limb body wall complex, is rare. Its just not survivable, a doctor involved in Beths care told CNN. They will die. Theres no way there will be a life, said Dr. Alireza Shamshirsaz, a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, who was not involved in Beths care. The condition posed dangers for Beth too, and the bigger the baby was, the higher the risk of complications, including dangerous bleeding that might require a hysterectomy. They say their doctor urged them to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible. The condition Beth Long's baby had, limb body wall complex, is rare. Most of the child's organs were outside the body. Department of Fetal MedicineUniversity College Hospital, London UK But when the Longs tried to schedule the abortion, they found out that their insurance wouldnt pay for it. Beth takes care of breast cancer patients at a state-owned hospital. Shes employed by the state of Ohio, and state law bans her health insurance from paying for abortions except in certain cases. Endangerment to the life of the mother is one of them, and although she was at an increased risk for potentially deadly complications, Beths life was not in imminent danger, and the Longs say their doctor told them the insurance wouldnt cover the procedure. Beth and Kyle would have to foot the bill between 20,000 and 30,000. After spending 45,000 on fertility treatments, they didnt have the money. Texas woman almost dies because she couldn't get an abortion It took them three weeks to make arrangements to go to a hospital that could perform the complicated abortion at a lower price. It was hours away, in another state. During that three-week wait a wait they had to endure only because of the Ohio law the risk to Beth of potentially deadly complications grew. Their ability to try to have another baby was delayed, and their agony couldnt end, Beth said. I was in mental anguish, Beth said. It felt very inhumane for both our baby and for my wife, Kyle added. The hospital they found was a three-hour drive away, in Pittsburgh. Away from their regular obstetrician, whom Beth had known for years away from their doula away from their friends and family. The Longs were alone. Kyle Long and Beth Boring in February 2018, shortly after their engagement. Rachel Joy Barehl The Long and Boring wedding Beth Boring and Kyle Long met on a dating app in 2015. Their first date was a storytelling event at a local arts organization. Beth, who was 26 at the time, had been a teacher for special-needs children and was about to start nursing school. I loved her big heart, Kyle says. Kyle, then 30 and a wedding photographer, told Beth hed bring her food when she started school. Ill bring you fries and dinner while you study and I wont bother you at all, she remembers him telling her. He was so sweet and made a big effort to love everyone in my life, and that was important to me, she said. Kyle made me feel completely safe and respected. BOULDER, CO - JANUARY 31, 2022 Dr Warren Hern organizes his tools inside his clinic on January 31, 2022 in Boulder, Colorado. He has been performing abortions since the 1970s.Gina Ferazzi Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Gina FerazziLos Angeles TimesGetty Images 'Heartbreaking' stories go untold, doctors say, as employers 'muzzle' them in wake of abortion ruling Kyle proposed on December 24, 2017, in Beths living room. She was stressed from studying for nursing school exams, with books and papers strewn around the room. She said that if I could love in the cycle of life she was in, then we should be able to make it through anything, Kyle recalls. Directly after the proposal, Beth and Kyle went to Christmas Eve services at Central Vineyard Church in Columbus and shared the exciting news with family and friends, jokingly inviting them to the Long and Boring wedding, which took place at the church in June. Kyle and Beth Long tried to start a family soon after their wedding in 2018. Beth was now 29. They tried to start a family soon after, but after a year of trying, a doctor discovered that Beth had advanced endometriosis, and she had surgery in February 2020. They then spent 15,000 on a round of fertility treatments that didnt yield any viable embryos. A second round, at the same price, had the same result. The process was grueling. Beth had to give herself shots of hormones, and for some of the treatments, they had to do a four-hour round-trip drive to the Cleveland Clinic. Between each round, they had to wait months to try again, with even more delays as doctors appointments often had to be canceled and rescheduled because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, a third round yielded three viable embryos two boys and a girl. I just had a gut feeling we were supposed to transfer the girl to her uterus, Beth said. Tara and Justin George speak with CNN about her pregnancy. MS 18624198 Ohio's new abortion law forces doctor to fight to protect her patient's life Shes perfect! the doctor said on September 20, 2022, just before he implanted the embryo into Beths uterus. Inside her womb, the embryo was tiny and looked like it was blinking. She was just this little glowy dot on a screen, and she kind of looked like a shooting star, so we called her Star. Shes always been Star to us, Beth said. They waited seven weeks to see whether the implantation had worked. They did an ultrasound, and they confirmed her heartbeat, Beth remembers. The tech said it was perfect. Perfect heartbeat. Wed finally made it to pregnancy, Kyle said. Wed spent years working on this, thousands of miles, thousands of dollars trying to get here, and it finally felt like it was worth it. Another ultrasound in December, when Beth was 16 weeks pregnant, also looked good, and they shared the happy news with their families at Christmas. At that 16-week visit, Beth also had blood taken for routine tests. They didnt think much about that blood work until they received a phone call just after the new year. Incompatible with life On January 4, the day before Beths 34th birthday, she received a call from her obstetrician. I could tell it was her serious voice, Beth remembers. She said, Some of your lab work came back abnormal. The doctor explained that the baby might have a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida. Kyle started keeping a journal that day. We are prepared to raise a child with any disabilities, he wrote. The next day, Beths birthday, we meet with the genetic counselor, and she reassures us that she has seen a lot of fluke results and not to worry, Kyle wrote. And even if it wasnt a fluke, most potential issues seemed small. If there was a large issue, it could likely be fixed with surgery. It would require us to potentially temporarily move to a new city, but we both feel optimistic going into the scan, Kyle wrote. Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas Still, the scan felt like the longest 15 minutes of our life, he wrote. The ultrasound technician left the room and returned with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, the genetic counselor and a nurse. We knew something was wrong, Kyle wrote. The doctor explained how the baby hadnt developed a lower spine and the rib cage was large enough to hold only her heart, which was beating. There were organs outside her body. Her heart was inside her body, but it was abnormal, said the physician involved with Beths care. This is not compatible with survival. The doctor asked not to be named because the hospital where they work has not given them permission to speak to the media. The Longs remember their doctors repeatedly using the phrase incompatible with life as they explained that the baby would probably die inside Beth or during birth. At the ultrasound, the doctor named a few more wrong things, but at that point I was more focused on Beth. At that moment we realized we were never going to have our baby girl, Kyle wrote in the journal. We would have done anything to make her better, Kyle said. But theres no surgery, theres no magic pill that we could have done to make things better. Marlena Stell In some states, doctors weigh 'ruinous' litigation against proper care for women who have miscarriages The doctors assured the Longs that theyd done nothing wrong Stars rare condition was just by chance. Were really good at winning the bad lottery, Beth said. The next day, the Longs met with Beths obstetrician. They said she explained that Stars organs, besides her heart, had spilled out of a hole in her abdomen and were enmeshed in the placenta. The doctor explains to us that the sooner the pregnancy is ended the better it will be for Beths health. The longer the baby grows with these abnormalities, it will continue to have a worse and worse impact on Beths health, Kyle wrote in his journal. Beth said that if the placenta tore during the procedure, I could have a lot of internal bleeding because the bigger Star grew, the more complicated and enmeshed the placenta was going to be, so time was of the essence. Shamshirsaz, director of the Maternal Fetal Care Center at Boston Childrens Center and a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, noted that a 21-week fetus is significantly larger than a 17-week fetus, so the three-week wait put Beth at a higher risk for bleeding and other complications. We know in obstetrics if we can do an earlier termination, the outcomes will be better. That is set in stone, he said. Dr. Erika Werner is the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Ive had lots of patients who never thought they would consider termination that have ended up terminating because of this diagnosis, said Werner, who was not involved in Beths care. The Capitol dome is seen early Wednesday morning before Amb. William Taylor And Deputy Assistant Secretary Of State George Kent testify at the first public impeachment hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill November 13, 2019 in Washington, DC. Sarah SilbigerGetty Images House passes 'born alive' abortion bill Beths obstetrician said she wouldnt be the one to do the abortion. She would reach out to one of the few specialists in Columbus who could do the complicated and risky procedure. Over the next few days, the couple grieved for their lost baby daughter. As Kyle photographed a wedding, he watched little girls dancing with their dads during the fatherdaughter song, and he knew hed never have that chance with Star. They gave their baby a full name Cordelia Poppy Star Long, with Star as a nickname because thats what she looked like at the implantation and Corn Pop because it was cute, Kyle wrote in his journal. While they waited to hear back from the obstetrician, Kyle called a local funeral home to arrange for Stars cremation while Beth knit and crocheted tiny dresses for Star. On January 9, three days after their appointment with the obstetrician, the Longs signed a form so they could officially begin Ohios 24-hour waiting period before an abortion. The termination was supposed to take place in the next day or two, and while they dreaded it, they hoped it would mark the beginning of a recovery period, and then they try as soon as possible to implant one of their other two viable embryos. But that didnt happen. Kyle wrote this in his journal Tuesday, 110 The doctor calls and lets us know that none of it will be covered by insurance. It was horrifying The doctor explained that while it was legal for them to have the abortion, a 1998 Ohio law made it illegal for state employees insurance to cover the procedure except in certain narrow cases. The mothers life being endangered if the fetus were carried to term is one of them, but the law doesnt define what endangered means. In his journal, Kyle wrote that the doctors gave them four options One, pay the 20,000 to 30,000 and have the abortion right away in Ohio with the specialist their obstetrician had selected two, wait until the baby died inside Beth, and then insurance would cover the abortion three, wait until Beths life was at sufficient risk that the insurance would cover it or four, find someplace else where they could do the procedure for less money. Kyle was ready to whip out a credit card and pay for the procedure to be done soon at the hospital they were already familiar with in Ohio, Beth said. Mifepristone Mifeprex and Misoprostol, the two drugs used in a medication abortion, are seen at the Women's Reproductive Clinic, which provides legal medication abortion services, in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, on June 17, 2022. Mifepristone is taken first to stop the pregnancy, followed by Misoprostol to induce bleeding. - In the wake of Friday's ruling by the US Supreme Court striking down Roe v Wade and the federally protected right to an abortion, women from Texas and other states are traveling to clinics like the Women's Reproductive Health Clinic in New Mexico for legal abortion services under the state's more liberal laws. - RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE Photo by Robyn Beck AFP RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE Photo by ROBYN BECKAFP via Getty Images Robyn BeckAFPGetty Images Some major pharmacies are planning to dispense abortion pills, but not in every state I was so motivated to just shell out the money and get it done, Kyle added. Just so it would be easy on us from a mental standpoint. Beth appreciated her husbands efforts to protect her, but she wanted to save money for implantation of their remaining two embryos and for fertility treatments to create more embryos if those didnt take. Shed already taken unpaid time off work during her pregnancy, and she was about to miss more work. For Beth it made more sense to put the focus on our future children, Kyle wrote. They decided to try the last option finding a qualified doctor who would do the procedure for less money. It was horrifying because we were experiencing the hardest pain that anybody could have, and on top of that, of our grieving, were having to handle all of this ourselves and coordinate all of this ourselves, Kyle said. A race against the clock Beth was now nearly 19 weeks pregnant. She and Kyle were racing against the clock. Ohio law allows for abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Plus, with each passing day, the baby was growing larger, putting Beth at increasing risk of potentially deadly complications when it came time for the termination. To spare Beth more anguish, Kyle made calls to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and various hospitals in the state. He wanted to be as close to home as possible so they could be near friends and family for support and so Beth wouldnt have to endure traveling and staying at a hotel. When he failed to find a place for Beth to have the procedure, he was once again resigned to putting it on his credit card.

AP PhotoAlex Brandon Alex BrandonAP Republicans are now splintering over abortion rights But then he received a call back from Leah Mallinos, a social worker and patient navigator at Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. She said UPMC Magee Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh would do the procedure for 2,500. But it couldnt happen immediately. There needed to be a virtual appointment with a Magee doctor and a transfer of medical records, and they needed to wait for availability at Magee. While they waited, they grieved the loss of their daughter. Beth bought a fetal Doppler to listen to Stars heartbeat. She listened to it over and over. She had a good, strong heart. I was so proud of that heartbeat, she said. She had worked really, really hard to grow. On Instagram, Beth posted a video of the Doppler on her belly, recording Stars heartbeat. I love her, she wrote in the post. And I refuse to let her suffer or be in pain for even a moment when shes on the outside of me. Abortion is the most loving thing I can do for her as her mother, even if it shatters my heart. Beth prepared for her daughters death. I dont think Im ever going to forget the feeling of my baby girl kicking inside of me while I was looking for urns on the Internet for her ashes, Beth said. Still, she would have to wait another two weeks before she could have the abortion in Pittsburgh. On January 23, she and Kyle made the drive, bringing with them for comfort Mr. Darcy, Beths dog of 11 years, and the dresses that Beth had made for Star. The next day, they signed papers for Pennsylvanias 24-hour waiting period. The Longs brought baby dresses Beth had knit to her procedure. Kyle and Elizabeth Long Because Beth was so far along in her pregnancy by this time, she was 21 weeks it was a two-day procedure. On January 26, the dresses Beth had made lay on her stomach as she was waiting to go into the operating room. Kyle kissed his wifes head as she cried and then went to her belly to tell his daughter goodbye, that he loved her and that he was sorry he and her mother couldnt save her life. Heather Bradley, a doula who specializes in helping grieving parents, took close-up pictures of Stars feet wrapped in one of the dresses Beth had made. A doula took this picture of Star's feet to help Beth and Kyle remember her. Heather Burke BradleyPittsburgh Bereavement Doulas Bradley, founder of Pittsburgh Bereavement Doulas, said she is usually able to control her emotions even in the saddest of situations, but this one was different. I felt myself tearing up, she said. The Longs had made the worst decision anyone ever has to make, and then to deal with all the other logistics they had to deal with was just ridiculous. She said the Longs were hanging by a thread after the procedure as they headed back to Columbus. Theyre traveling in a car for three hours after having an abortion. Things can happen. You should be resting and being monitored, sleeping, letting your body heal. You shouldnt have to be worrying about where were going to stop to eat or the expense. Planned Parenthood gave the Longs 500 for the hotel and the Abortion Fund of Ohio gave them 1,800 toward the 2,500 hospital charge for the procedure, but the Longs say they paid 1,150 out of pocket, which included the rest of the hospital charge and travel expenses. In addition, they expect bills from the anesthesiologist and other specialists involved in the procedure. It was a tough drive. We drove there with our child, and we were driving home without her, Kyle said. Beth and Kyle said goodbye to their daughter, Cordelia Poppy Star Long. Reaching out to lawmakers Kyle has reached out to his elected representatives, including Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Sen. JD Vance, both Republicans. He told them that Ohio law had turned a difficult situation into something nearly unbearable. I am a lifelong Republican, but this has turned me into a one-issue voter for those that support reproductive rights. Im writing you to please reconsider how you approach reproductive rights going forward. There are a lot of unintended consequences for families from these laws, and while I can understand you come from a good place, care should ultimately be left to the parents and their physicians. We loved our baby girl and would have done anything to keep her, he wrote, adding that Ohio abortion laws prevent grieving parents from the healthcare they need. He says he never received a response from either DeWine or Vance. Protesters who support more abortion restrictions and protestors who upset at the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling removing protections for abortions demonstrate in the lobby of the South Carolina Statehouse on Tuesday, June 28, 2022, in Columbia South Carolina. Jeffrey CollinsAP Activists preparing for 'an absolutely crazy year' in first full statehouse sessions since Supreme Court overturned Roe Spokespeople for DeWine and Vance told CNN that they plan on responding to Kyles email. DeWine noted that the law banning state insurance from paying for abortions was enacted before he took office. A spokesperson for Beths workplace, which owns the insurance plan, says it will continue to comply with the law while providing exceptional patient care. Beth belongs to the Ohio Nurses Association, a union affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers. What happened to Beth is an abomination, federation President Randi Weingarten said. The results of not getting proper and timely care due to egregious systemic roadblocks and financial constraints not only causes bodily harm but trauma that will last a lifetime. Reproductive care must be a decision that belongs between a patient and a doctor, not with politicians, she added. Trying to help others Nearly two weeks after the abortion, Beth and Kyle are filled with both grief and anger. We wanted more than anything to have this baby, and the laws in place prevented us from getting the proper health care that we needed, Kyle said. It delayed us being able to lay Star to rest and grieve our baby for three weeks. As soon as Beths doctors tell them its OK, they plan to implant one of their two remaining embryos in the hopes of starting a new pregnancy. In the meantime, theyre mourning Star and want to help other families who might be in their situation. First, they want them to know that there are resources to help, such as Planned Parenthood and groups like the Abortion Fund of Ohio. Second, theyre reaching out to state legislators who support the heartbeat bill that passed the Ohio legislature in 2019. It banned nearly all abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, about the sixth week of pregnancy, but a judge in Cincinnati issued an injunction in October, and now in Ohio abortion is allowed up to 22 weeks. They say they hope their story will help change legislators minds.

I dont want any other families to have to go through this, Kyle said. I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy, and something needs to change, Beth adds that she thinks all women should have the right to an abortion, not just women like her whose babies have fatal abnormalities. It was the most dehumanizing experience of my life, she said. CNNs John Bonifield and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.

CNN Sans 2016 Cable News Network.","This part of the text follows Beth and Kyle Long as they face a heartbreaking decision regarding their unborn daughter, Star, who was diagnosed with a fatal condition, anencephaly, which would lead to her death shortly after birth. They sought an abortion but encountered significant challenges due to Ohio’s restrictive abortion laws.

Initially, the couple was advised to proceed with an abortion as soon as possible due to the increased risks of complications as Star’s pregnancy progressed. However, Ohio’s laws, including a 1998 law limiting insurance coverage for abortions, complicated their situation. The law only allowed state employee insurance to cover abortions if the mother’s life was endangered, a condition which was not clearly defined. They were given several options: pay tens of thousands for the procedure upfront, wait for Star to die inside Beth, wait until Beth’s life was at greater risk, or travel to another state where the procedure could be performed more affordably.

After exploring their options, they chose to seek care in Pennsylvania at UPMC Magee Women’s Hospital, where they would have to wait several weeks for an appointment. During this time, they grieved and prepared for their loss, with Beth even listening to Star’s heartbeat via a Doppler. They eventually had to endure a two-day procedure to terminate the pregnancy, where Beth was in her 21st week. Afterward, they drove back home while grieving the loss of their daughter.

Financially burdened by the costs, they received partial financial support from Planned Parenthood and the Abortion Fund of Ohio but still faced substantial out-of-pocket expenses. Kyle reached out to Ohio lawmakers, including Governor Mike DeWine and Senator JD Vance, to express his frustration with the state’s abortion laws, but received no response. They hope to use their story to raise awareness and advocate for better reproductive rights, as they believe no family should face such challenges while dealing with a painful loss.

Beth and Kyle also plan to continue their journey to try for another child but remain focused on helping other families facing similar situations by sharing their story and advocating for legislative change. Beth’s experience with the restrictive abortion laws left her feeling dehumanized, and she believes all women should have the right to make decisions about their pregnancies, not just those in situations like hers."

WilliamsNina Berman ReduxMay 9, 2022ShareSave When the Supreme Court issued its landmark abortion-rights decision, Roe v. Wade, in 1973, the most intransigent opponents of the decision were not the legislatures of southern Bible Belt states such as Mississippi and Oklahoma. Indeed, doctors in many southern statesincluding Arkansas, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Virginiahad been performing legal hospital abortions for at least a few carefully defined therapeutic reasons for years before Roe. The state legislatures that presented the strongest defiance to legalizing abortion were those of the heavily Catholic states of the Northeast. Barely 10 percent of Massachusetts legislators supported legalizing abortion in 1973, according to an archival American Civil Liberties Union document. Instead of permitting the procedure up to the point of viability about 28 weeks at the time, as the Supreme Court mandated, the Massachusetts state legislature responded to Roe by passing a bill prohibiting abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy. Rhode Islands statehouse presented even stronger opposition It kept abortion clinics out of the state until 1975, when its anti-abortion law was overturned by a federal court.Today, of course, Massachusetts and the rest of New England are in the vanguard of states that will protect abortion access ifwhen, as it now appearsRoe v. Wade is rescinded. And many of the southern states that liberalized their abortion laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s are now at the forefront of the movement to restrict abortion.From the May 2022 issue The future of abortion in a post-Roe AmericaThis was not merely a geographic shift, trading one region for another, but a more fundamental transformation of the anti-abortion movements political ideology. In 1973 many of the most vocal opponents of abortion were northern Democrats who believed in an expanded social-welfare state and who wanted to reduce abortion rates through prenatal insurance and federally funded day care. In 2022, most anti-abortion politicians are conservative Republicans who are skeptical of such measures. What happened was a seismic religious and political shift in opposition to abortion that has not occurred in any other Western country.Before the mid-1970s, active opposition to abortion in the United States looked almost exactly like opposition to abortion in Britain, Western Europe, and Australia It was concentrated mainly among Catholics. As late as 1980, 70 percent of the members of the nations largest anti-abortion organization, the National Right to Life Committee, were Catholic. As a result, the states that were most resistant to abortion legalization were, in most cases, the states with the highest concentration of Catholics, most of which were in the North and leaned Democratic.This fit the pattern across the Western world Countries with large numbers of devout Catholics restricted abortion, while those that were predominantly Protestant did not. Swedenwhere Catholics made up less than 1 percent of the populationlegalized some abortions as early as the 1930s Ireland did not follow suit until 2018.If the United States had followed this script, opposition to abortion probably would have weakened with the decline of Catholic-church attendance rates. Like Canada and England, where the leading conservative parties are overwhelmingly supportive of abortion rights, the Republican Party in the United States might have remained what it was for most of the 1970s a heavily Protestant party whose leaders generally leaned in favor of abortion rights.But in the United States, the anti-abortion movement did not remain predominantly Catholic. Southern evangelical Protestants, who had once hesitated to embrace the anti-abortion movement in the belief that it was a sectarian Catholic campaign, began enlisting in the cause in the late 70s and 80s. Motivated by a conviction that Roe v. Wade was a product of liberal social changes they opposedincluding secularization, the sexual revolution, second-wave feminism, and a rights-conscious reading of the Constitutionthey made opposition to the ruling a centerpiece of the new Christian right. When they captured control of the Republican Party in the late 20th century, they transformed the GOP from a northern-centered mainline Protestant party that was moderately friendly to abortion rights into a hotbed of southern populism that blended economic libertarianism with Bible Belt moral regulation.Read Americas blue-red divide is about to get starkerThe change was not instantaneous. Although the Republican Party endorsed an anti-abortion constitutional amendment in its party platform in 1976, partly because of its desire to win over northern Catholics, the party at first gave the idea little more than lip service, and pro-abortion-rights conservatives continued to hold leadership positions in the GOP for several more years. In 1983, the Republican-controlled Senate considered an anti-abortion constitutional amendment, but one-third of Republican senators voted against it, dooming it to defeat. However, as evangelical Protestants from the South acquired a greater controlling interest in the GOP, Republicans had a harder time ignoring their desire to restrict abortion. The crucial change came in the midterm elections of 1994, when southern conservatives gave Republicans the votes they needed to take over both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Newt Gingrichs Contract With America did not mention abortion, but southern evangelicals insisted that the GOP needed to pay attention to the issue. When the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, attempted to moderate the partys platform statement on abortion, right-wing Christian activists blocked the change.But what really motivated anti-abortion activists to remain loyal to the GOP was not merely a platform statement but the promise of the Supreme Court. They believed that the Republican Party offered them the only path to a conservative judiciary that would overturn Roe v. Wade. If this goal required them to accept a conservative economic platform at odds with the views that many in the movement had held before Roe, well, that was of little matter, because many of the evangelical-Protestant anti-abortion advocates were political conservatives anyway.As late as the beginning of this century, Texas still had a pro-abortion-rights Protestant Republican senator, while Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Minnesota were still represented in Congress by anti-abortion Democrats who were Catholic. But as the historically Catholic population of the North became less devout and therefore less inclined to follow the Churchs teaching on abortionand as a younger generation of progressive Democrats began to view reproductive rights as a nonnegotiable part of the Democratic Party platformanti-abortion influence in the politically liberal states of the Northeast diminished, while it expanded in the South.The anti-abortion movements political priorities changed as a result. A movement that in the early 70s had attracted some political progressives who opposed the Vietnam War and capital punishment became associated in the 80s and 90s with evangelical-inspired conservative-Christian nationalism. Early activists wanted to create a comprehensive culture of life, but many of the evangelicals who joined the movement in the late 20th century wanted to save America from secularism and take back the nation for God.Only a minority of white evangelical Protestants were politically progressive the majority especially in the South were conservative, and they combined their commitment to moral regulation with a faith in free-market economics and opposition to social-welfare spending. American evangelicalism had long been the most individualistic of the nations Christian traditions, and in keeping with that individualistic theology of sin and salvation, most white evangelicals thought that the governments interest in morality extended only to the punishment of individual vice, not the reduction of poverty. Thus, as the anti-abortion movements political influence shifted away from Catholic states toward evangelical-Protestant regions, it abandoned its earlier calls for federal antipoverty programs, expanded maternal-health insurance, and federally funded day care, and instead focused exclusively on the narrower issue of overturning Roe v. Wade and making abortion illegal.Rachel Rebouch and Mary Ziegler Theres no knowing what will happen when Roe fallsA few activists including a number of the northern Catholic veterans of the movement remained committed to poverty relief and a comprehensive culture-of-life ethic, but with the Democratic Partys current unequivocal endorsement of abortion rights, some of them felt politically homeless. Those activists began voting Republican despite their reservations about the partys stances on social-welfare issueswhich brought them into alliance with the southern evangelical conservatives who now had the political power to restrict abortion in their region.The result is the map we have today The states that are most likely to restrict abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe are also some of the states with the least generous health-care policies. Half a century ago, many liberal, northern, anti-abortion Democrats saw a connection between poverty reduction and abortion prevention, but today most of those in the southern Bible Belt who oppose abortion do not. They may soon Because abortion rates are very closely correlated with poverty, opponents of the procedure may find reducing its prevalence difficult without expanding Medicaid or enacting other antipoverty measures.The enthusiastic embrace of the movement by white evangelicals in the Bible Belt was key to the movements political success. Yet the association of the movement with a brand of southern evangelical-conservative politics that opposes antipoverty measures may also mean that the repeal of Roe v. Wade wont reduce abortion rates as much as the movement expects. If these activists really want to save unborn lives, they may have to look for guidance not only to the southern conservatives who currently lead the movement but to the northern social-welfare advocates whose voices were once dominant in the movement but whose early influence has long been forgotten.Daniel K. Williams is a senior fellow at the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University. He is the author of The Politics of the Cross A Christian Alternative to Partisanship.","The article “This Really Is a Different Pro-Life Movement” by Daniel K. Williams explores the significant shift in the political and religious dynamics of the U.S. anti-abortion movement since the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Initially, opposition to abortion was led by northern Catholics, many of whom were also aligned with social-welfare policies aimed at reducing abortion through prenatal care and federally funded daycare. In contrast, by 2022, the movement was largely driven by conservative southern evangelicals, whose focus was on overturning Roe v. Wade rather than comprehensive social reforms.

In the 1970s and 1980s, southern evangelicals, initially skeptical of the Catholic-led anti-abortion cause, became more involved due to their opposition to secularization, feminism, and the sexual revolution. Their growing influence within the Republican Party transformed the party’s stance, making it staunchly anti-abortion and aligning it with evangelical moral views. This shift was crucial in turning the GOP from a moderate, northern Protestant party into a more conservative, southern-dominated one.

Over time, the movement’s political and moral priorities also shifted. Early anti-abortion activists sought a “culture of life,” encompassing broader social-welfare policies, while later evangelical leaders focused narrowly on abortion and opposed social welfare programs. As northern Catholics became less devout and the Democratic Party firmly endorsed abortion rights, many Catholic anti-abortion activists began voting Republican, despite disagreements on other issues.

Today, the political map reflects these changes: states most likely to restrict abortion are in the Bible Belt, where there is less emphasis on poverty reduction, even though abortion rates are closely tied to poverty. This raises the possibility that without addressing social welfare, the expected reduction in abortion rates may not materialize. The article suggests that for the pro-life movement to achieve its goal of reducing abortion, it may need to revisit the more comprehensive, social-welfare-focused approach that earlier Catholic activists advocated.

The article highlights the broader cultural and political transformation of the anti-abortion movement, shaped by the rise of evangelical influence and the shifting priorities within the Republican Party."

James PoulsonThe Daily Sitka Sentinel via AP Imagine taking a snowmobile, two flights, and a bus to get to one of four clinics offering abortion in your state the distance equivalent of traveling from New York City to Chicago. For the one-third of Alaskas women and girls living in the rural reaches of the state, this isnt a thought experiment its an everyday reality. Last week, things got worse. Under the guise of fighting Covid-19, Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy declared surgical abortions non-urgent, ordering them postponed unless the pregnancy endangered the womans life or physical health. Dunleavys order accidentally acknowledged how urgent abortion is by linking to American College of Surgeons guidance, which says delaying abortion could cause significant harm. The governor said the ban would continue through June 15. The restrictions disproportionately harm Alaskans already facing systemic barriers to health care rural, indigenous, young, and poor people. Surgical abortions, which require a single appointment, are performed in Alaska at rates above the US average. The alternative, medical abortions, or taking pills to end a pregnancy, currently require a follow-up appointment up to a week later, a major financial and logistical burden for many Alaskans. Restrictions on leaving some Alaskan communities during the pandemic compound the barriers. Too often people needing abortion care in Alaska are survivors of sexual violence. Rape occurs in the state at 2.5 times and child sexual assault at 6 times the national average. The crackdown on abortion in Alaska is not new. Anti-choice legislators have restricted abortions to state-approved facilities and prohibited nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives from providing abortions. These restrictions drove nine clinic closures since 1992. In 2019, Dunleavy blocked 334,700 in funds to the judiciary the exact amount the state spent funding abortions in 2018 in retaliation for a court ruling protecting Medicaid-funded abortions. Across the United States, nine other states are using Covid-19 to further anti-choice agendas, and lawmakers in four others are also considering them. Abortions are essential care, and governments can protect abortion care while fighting Covid-19. Telemedicine services and helping patients end pregnancies by self-administering pills at home can make abortion care more accessible, even in remote areas, while protecting health workers from potential exposure to the new coronavirus. Instead of using the pandemic as an excuse to roll back rights, policymakers in Alaska and elsewhere should protect everyones health now and into the future.

This policy disproportionately affects rural, indigenous, young, and low-income Alaskans, many of whom already face significant healthcare access barriers. Alaska’s vast geography requires people in rural areas to undertake long journeys—comparable to traveling from New York City to Chicago—to access abortion services, with only four clinics available. The ban also complicates access to medical abortions, which require follow-up appointments, exacerbating financial and logistical challenges.

Alaska’s restrictions on abortion are part of a broader national trend where several U.S. states have used the pandemic as a pretext to further restrict abortion access. In Alaska, these restrictions build on a history of anti-choice legislation, including previous restrictions on who can perform abortions and a history of clinic closures. The state has also faced criticism for funding cuts aimed at blocking Medicaid-funded abortions.

Human Rights Watch argues that abortion is essential healthcare, and that governments can safeguard access while responding to the pandemic by utilizing telemedicine and allowing self-administered medical abortions. The organization calls for policymakers to protect reproductive rights, especially for vulnerable populations, rather than using the health crisis to restrict access to abortion services."

We are inviting everyone, please, go out, be motivated, so we can walk together, make a mark, said protest group leader Marta Lempart.The ruling, handed down by the constitutional tribunal in October, found that terminating pregnancies due to severe foetal abnormalities is unconstitutional. Poland already has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe, and most of the small number of legal abortions that take place in the country are cases of foetal defects.Once the ruling goes into effect, abortion will only be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when the womans life is in danger.More than 400,000 people protested in hundreds of towns and cities across the country as part of a womens strike after the ruling. Theoretically, the rulings of the court should come into effect immediately, but there have been a number of cases where there have been long delays for apparently political reasons, and there was a sense that the government had been alarmed by the size of the protests and wanted to back away from the ruling.It would be good to take some time for dialogue and for finding a new position in this situation, which is difficult and stirs high emotions, Micha Dworczyk, the head of the prime ministers office, told Polish media in early November.'A backlash against a patriarchal culture' How Polish protests go beyond abortion rightsRead moreHowever, on Wednesday, the courts justification for the ruling was published, and the government said it expected to publish the ruling itself on Wednesday too, which would officially make it law.Polands ruling Law and Justice PiS party has been accused of politicising the constitutional tribunal and using it to push through its ultra-conservative agenda on abortion.The delay in publishing the ruling led to an uneasy situation over the past three months where doctors performing abortions were unsure from one day to the next whether the procedures would remain legal. Many Polish women take pills for medical abortions at home, while thousands of others are forced to travel abroad to seek abortion.Five of the courts 15 judges dissented from the majority opinion, although some of them only took issue with the justification, not with the substance of the ruling. The courts ruling framed the issue as being about defending the life of an unborn child, and told Polish legislators they should use the words child and mother when talking about abortions rather than foetus and pregnant woman.No law-abiding government should respect this ruling, said Borys Budka, the leader of Polands largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, Reuters reported. This article was amended on 28 January 2021. An earlier version, describing the effect of the ruling, said that abortion will only be permitted in cases of rape, incest or when the mothers life is in danger.

All rights reserved. dcr","In early 2021, Poland moved to enforce a near-total ban on abortion following a ruling from the country’s constitutional tribunal, which declared terminating pregnancies due to severe fetal abnormalities unconstitutional. This decision effectively restricts abortion access to cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. Poland, already known for its stringent abortion laws, saw massive protests after the ruling was first issued in October 2020, drawing over 400,000 people nationwide in one of the largest demonstrations in recent history. Protestors, led by groups such as the Women’s Strike, rallied in opposition, viewing the ban as a severe encroachment on women’s rights and autonomy.

The ruling sparked delays in formal publication due to political tensions, as the Polish government, led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, hesitated amid public backlash. The delay created legal ambiguities, with medical professionals uncertain about the legality of abortion procedures. Many women turned to self-managed abortion pills or traveled abroad for the procedure. The tribunal’s language emphasized “protecting the life of the unborn child,” prompting the government to direct lawmakers to use terms like “child” and “mother” instead of “fetus” and “pregnant woman.”

Critics, including opposition leaders like Borys Budka of the Civic Platform party, condemned the decision as an overreach influenced by the PiS’s conservative agenda. The ban ignited a broader social debate, with activists framing the protests as resistance against entrenched patriarchal values in Polish society."
Wiregrass rep lifts contest of Montgomery property tax referendum,"Wiregrass rep lifts contest of Montgomery property tax referendumSkip to main content HomeElectionsBusinessPrattvilleCrimePoliticsBlack BeltLegacy of LynchingsNational PoliticsCareersUSA TODAYThe American South Wiregrass rep lifts contest of Montgomery property tax referendumBrian Lyman Montgomery AdvertiserJust as the Montgomery County House delegation settled its differences over a local property tax referendum, the Wiregrass walked in. Rep. Mike Jones, R-Andalusia, blocked a floor vote Wednesday on a bill that would allow voters to decide on a 12-mill property tax increase to provide added funding for Montgomery Public Schools, according to State House staff and Reps. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery and Reed Ingram, R-Pike Road. I have not spoken to him about delaying a bill, have not spoken with him about doing away with the bill, said Ingram, who threatened to stop the bill but came to an agreement with Hatcher on Tuesday night to allow it to move forward. The rules of the chamber allow any member to file a challenge to a local bill, but it is unusual for a representative from one region to challenge a local bill in another. Jones said in a statement late Wednesday afternoon that he had lifted the challenge after speaking with Hatcher. Nearly all bills like this are in the form of a constitutional amendment and I wanted to make sure it could accomplish its purpose without it, the representative said in a statement. There were also two committee amendments that materially changed the legislation from what was advertised. Its possible those changes are substantial enough that could result in a future legal challenge.But the unusual action led to criticism and suggestions -- denied by Jones -- that the delay was due to politics. The Montgomery County branch of the Alabama Farmers Federation, a group with enormous sway among Republicans, opposes the referendum. ""The fact that he, the Rules Committee chair from Andalusia contested the bill in the first place is highly suspect,"" Hatcher wrote Wednesday evening. ""All of my Democratic colleagues agree.""Hatcher said he hoped to have the bill on the floor on Thursday. Weve had some very, very challenging days getting to this point in this process, he said on Wednesday. Weve had challenging days. When we speak about good fights, this is for children of Montgomery County this is a need that must be addressed, period.Montgomery Public Schools get 10 mills in local property tax revenue, the minimum allowed under state law. 3.5 mills come from the county, while 6.5 mills come from a system-wide assessment. Per-pupil funding in Montgomery lags other large districts in the state, contributing to the poor performance of many public schools in Montgomery.Under the referendum, voters would decide whether to add 12 mills to the systemwide assessment. For a house at the median level of assessment in Montgomery County 127,500, taxes would go up about 13 a month. Pike Road, which has its own separate school district and tax structure, would not be affected.Montgomery County Board of Education members say the new tax would raise about 33 million, which would go toward increasing teachers and staff, improving school buildings, and investing in technology. Were looking forward to a chance to allow the people to consider a property tax increase to fund our public schools, Montgomery County Board of Education President Clare Weil said in a statement Wednesday. Everyone understands that the future of Montgomery is directly tied to the success of our public schools.The Montgomery County delegation approved the bill on a 4-3 vote on Tuesday, but Ingram said he would block the measure from coming to a vote on the House floor. Ingram proposed pushing the election into 2021, arguing that the current economic climate did not justify a tax increase. Though the bill does not set a specific date for the referendum, Democrats on the committee said the agreement had been to put the proposal on the November ballot, when high turnout is expected. A special election is likely to reduce the chances of the measure passing. Ingrams amendment did not pass.More Pike Road rep wants to push Montgomery property tax vote to next yearIngram and Hatcher said they spoke late on Tuesday and agreed to an amendment Hatcher suggested at the Tuesday committee meeting. That change would delay the collection of the new revenues until 2022 without delaying the election. Ingram said he would not vote for the bill, but would not prevent it from coming to a vote. There may be other obstacles to overcome, including the opposition of the Montgomery County Farmers Federation. The Montgomery County Farmers Federation is opposed to this property tax increase, and we are helping communicate that position to members of the legislature, said Jeff Helms, a spokesman for the Farmers Federation, on Wednesday. Hatcher said Wednesday he was trying to secure votes. Should the bill pass the House, its prospects in the Senate are not clear. Sen. David Burkette, D-Montgomery, strongly supports the measure. A message seeking comment was left with Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, on Wednesday afternoon. Contact Brian Lyman at blymangannett.com or 334-240-0185.

The tax hike, designed to generate approximately $33 million annually, aims to improve Montgomery schools by increasing funding for teachers, staff, facilities, and technology. If approved, the tax would raise local taxes on a median-assessed home by around $13 per month, while Pike Road, which has its own district and tax system, would remain unaffected.

The delay occurred when Rep. Mike Jones, R-Andalusia, challenged the bill despite it being a local matter for Montgomery County. His involvement was unusual and sparked political criticism. Jones later lifted his challenge after discussions with Rep. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, explaining he wanted clarity on the legal viability of the bill, which had seen significant amendments.

Local support and opposition for the measure are divided. Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Pike Road, initially opposed the bill but later agreed not to block it after negotiating a delay in tax collection until 2022. The Montgomery County Farmers Federation also voiced opposition, citing economic concerns. The Montgomery delegation narrowly approved the bill (4-3), though its path in the Alabama Senate remains uncertain. Hatcher, a strong proponent, highlighted the critical need for funding to support Montgomery students’ education and community futures."

They could do some serious, long-lasting damage, but I really, really, really do not believe that is going to happen.Meanwhile David Cohen, a pro-choice Drexel University law professor and co-author of Obstacle Course The Everyday Struggle to Get an Abortion in America, described the coming election as an all-consuming news item this year. He said We have two parties with starkly different views on abortion, so that is going to be a major issue in the presidential campaign.An unprecedented wave of the most restrictive anti-abortion lawsThis week marks the 47th anniversary of the landmark US supreme court case Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion in the US and has been a target for conservatives since the religious right adopted abortion as a cause in the late 1970s.Hundreds of thousands of anti-abortion protesters will also gather in Washington DC on 24 January for the March for Life, the nations largest anti-abortion protest. And the evidence of recent years shows they are successfully rolling back access to abortion across the US.View image in fullscreenAnti-abortion activists protest outside the supreme court during the March for Life in Washington DC, on 18 January 2019. Photograph Jos Luis MagaaAPLast year saw an unprecedented wave of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in decades, many blatantly unconstitutional. In 2019, so-called heartbeat bills, which ban abortion at six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant, became law in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Mississippi. Alabama banned abortion outright.In one case, an extreme bill proposed in Ohio would have charged doctors with abortion murder if they did not attempt to re-implant an ectopic pregnancy. There is no such procedure in medical science, and ectopic pregnancies that form in the fallopian tubes are never viable. They do, however, threaten womens lives.None of these laws are in effect, as they directly contravene law set out in Roe v Wade. This is by design. Emboldened by Trump and funded by conservative Republican mega-donors, abortion opponents hope they can push the right-leaning supreme court to take up a case and overturn Roe, even though most of the public agrees abortion should remain legal.The main takeaway is that the states will continue to be important players on abortion laws and regulation,said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute.Clinics are shuttering in large numbers in the south and midwestThere will be an intense focus on the supreme court this spring, as it hears oral arguments in June Medical Services LLC v Gee. The case from Louisiana focuses on whether doctors should be required to obtain the right to admit patients to local hospitals and will have national implications.The right to admit patients to hospitals, called admitting privileges, is meant to sound like it improves womens health. In fact, hospitals are already required to take all cases which come through the emergency department. Instead, admitting privileges often serve as an insurmountable hurdle for doctors who practice independently at abortion clinics, in effect closing their practices.If it is ruled constitutional, the regulation could shut down two of Louisianas three abortion clinics, despite providing no measurable health benefits for women. Legal scholars were shocked the countrys highest court was even hearing the case. It ruled on an identical law from Texas in 2016, finding the measures unconstitutional and an undue burden to women seeking abortions.The breadth of the outcomes is really wide, said Cohen. The case could result in everything from you can regulate a little more to you can outlaw abortion. So theres a lot we dont know about whats coming in the future.But if the case in the supreme court could decide the legal fate of abortion rights, a womans ability to exercise her right is already in dire straits. Between 2011 and 2017, 4 of abortion clinics closed across the US. This modest change obscures a broader truth clinics are shuttering in large numbers in the south and midwest and opening on the coasts, leading to expensive logistical nightmares for many women.We just have to keep on fightingAbortion is now central to Americas culture wars, one of a number of divisive issues shaped by a hyper-partisan political divide. Trump has played a key role in widening the gulf and attempting to exploit it for electoral gain.Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers womb right up until the moment of birth, Trump told a booing audience at a recent rally in Toledo, Ohio. That statement is false but emblematic.Abortion is a repeat topic as Trump campaigns for re-election at rallies, where his rhetoric often goes beyond what even the anti-abortion movement could have hoped for from past Republican candidates.The truth about late-term abortions in the US they're very rareRead moreTobias and other anti-abortion activists have worked diligently to spread news of Trumps amazing work to the broader electorate. She mentioned a list of his administrations achievements that the movement holds in esteem, including remaking the federal bench with ideological judges and preventing foreign aid from being used to advise women on abortions.Im expecting more pro-life laws to be passed, and there will of course be more challenges in the court, but were moving forward, said Tobias.View image in fullscreenPeople during a rally calling for abortion rights outside the US supreme court in Washington DC, on 21 May 2019. Photograph Ting ShenXinhuaBarcroft MediaThat was not always the case. The Christian right only took up the mantle of abortion after Roe was decided and after the supreme court ruled against the segregationist policies of private Christian schools, many of which were founded to exclude African American students.Southern Baptists even supported abortion rights at their annual conference until 1976. Until Roe, abortion was seen mostly as an issue for the Catholic church, and it was predominantly Democratic states that opposed access to abortion and contraceptives.Now, most Americans nearly 80, according to Gallup polling support legal abortion in at least some circumstances. However, abortion has historically been a motivating issue for conservative voters, less so for liberals. That has led to a virulent anti-abortion right, while the left has only begun to enshrine abortion rights in state law.Loretta Ross is a reproductive justice activist and expert who has worked not just for abortion rights but against pregnancy discrimination and maternal mortality. We just have to keep on fighting the same way black people have to keep on fighting for voting rights for 400 years, she said.Some older feminists in particular fear abortion rights, which younger women have grown up with, have been taken for granted since Roe v Wade. Doctors such as Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, worry about a return to illegal and deadly procedures.Unfortunately, the young women today dont realize how bad it was, said Minkin. When she was attending Brown University in 1968, I knew of a young woman a couple years before me, she got pregnant during freshman week.She was subsequently infertile had an illegal abortion done, and couldnt get pregnant thereafter, said Minkin. There were, of course, even worse outcomes. One of Minkins mothers friends had a sister, a flight attendant, who died from an illegal abortion.There were very dark times with people dying having septic abortions and people being infertile for the rest of their lives, said Minkin. We dont want to go back to that. We really dont want to go back to that.Explore more on these topicsAbortionHealthWomenUS supreme courtLaw USGenderWomen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved. dcr","The Guardian article by Jessica Glenza explores the intensifying debate over abortion rights in the United States in 2020, as the country approached pivotal legal and political moments. Key developments included the Supreme Court’s decision to hear an abortion-related case for the first time since its shift to a conservative majority. This case, June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, from Louisiana, could have national implications, potentially challenging or even overturning the historic Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in 1973. The central issue was whether doctors performing abortions needed “admitting privileges” at local hospitals, a requirement critics say places unnecessary burdens on clinics and could lead to clinic closures.

The political landscape was also crucial. With President Donald Trump running for re-election, abortion became a focal issue, with Republicans and Democrats holding starkly opposing views. Anti-abortion advocates, bolstered by Trump’s conservative judicial appointments, aimed to roll back abortion rights, while Democrats pledged to protect them. Both sides viewed the November 2020 election as critical to the future of abortion access.

Simultaneously, several conservative states, emboldened by the changing judicial landscape, enacted some of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws, including “heartbeat bills” that ban abortions as early as six weeks, and even proposals to criminalize doctors who do not attempt to reimplant ectopic pregnancies—a medically unfeasible procedure. Although these laws contradicted Roe v. Wade and were blocked from enforcement, supporters aimed to escalate them to the Supreme Court, hoping for a judicial overturn.

The article also highlighted the socioeconomic and geographical disparities in abortion access, noting that clinics were closing rapidly in the South and Midwest, increasing logistical barriers for many women. In response, pro-choice advocates stressed the importance of preserving legal and safe access to abortion, recalling the dangerous, illegal abortions prevalent before Roe v. Wade. This background underscored the stakes of the 2020 legal battles, with advocates like Yale’s Dr. Mary Jane Minkin warning of the health risks that could arise from rolling back abortion rights.

In summary, 2020 emerged as a pivotal year for abortion rights in the U.S., with both legal and political arenas placing unprecedented pressure on Roe v. Wade. As the anti-abortion movement gained momentum through new state laws and judicial support, pro-choice activists focused on safeguarding access, especially with the potential for a conservative Supreme Court to reshape the future of abortion rights."

Russian state intelligence is hacking international research centers that are racing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, the U.K., U.S. and Canadian government's said today. Photographer Al DragoBloomberg via Getty ImagesBloombergSave this storySaveSave this storySaveEarlier this month, Idahos House passed a uniquely evil abortion bill modeled on Texass but with its own special spin. Like the Lone Star States S.B. 8, the Idaho bill bans abortions after six weeks, a time by which many people dont even know theyre pregnant. Yet unlike Texas, which empowers any old private citizen to sue to enforce the law, Idaho specifically allowsand some might say encouragesfamily members of the fetus, including family members of rapists, to sue abortion providers for up to four years after the procedure. In other words, at a time when reproductive rights are under daily assault, Idaho is going the extra mile to make things extra evil and f--ked up for pregnant people, some of whom got that way as a result of a violent crime. And you know who else thinks this bill is beyond the pale? Idahos governor. But dont worry, he put his reservations aside and signed it into law anyway.In a message to Lieutenant Governor Janice McGeachin, Idaho governor Brad Little wrote, While I support the pro-life policy in this legislation, I fear the novel civil enforcement mechanism will in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise. He said that he had significant concerns with the unintended consequences this legislation will have on victims of sexual assault, noting that this legislation risks retraumatizing victims by affording monetary incentives to wrongdoers and family members of rapists. The bill establishes minimum damages of 20,000, in addition to legal fees. But rather than vetoing iteven if it were a symbolic veto that ultimately got overturnedLittle signed the bill and encouraged the Republican-controlled legislature to fix any unintended consequences of the legislation, which were sure theyll get to posthaste.As weve seen in the case of Texas, even just the threat of lawsuits has had a chilling effect since September, when S.B. 8 went into effect, abortions in Texas have plummeted 60, according to The New York Times. On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood said its clinics in Idaho would stay open, adding in a statement This law is unconstitutional, dangerous, and an assault on the hundreds of thousands of Idahoans of reproductive age. There is no excuse or justification for the trauma and harm this law will cause.Of course, Idaho and Texas arent the only states trying to turn The Handmaids Tale into a work of nonfiction. In Missouri, one lawmaker wants to inhibit residents from obtaining abortions out of state, while another wants to make it a felony to abort an ectopic pregnancy, a medical condition that is the leading cause of death in the first trimester. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Oklahomas House of Representatives passed a bill banning abortions at any time, except in cases where the procedure is needed to save the life of the mother.

Modeled after Texas’s S.B. 8, Idaho’s law prohibits abortions after six weeks and allows family members, including those of rapists, to sue abortion providers for up to four years after the procedure. Critics argue this could retraumatize victims and incentivize harmful behavior by awarding $20,000 in damages plus legal fees to those who sue.

Governor Little acknowledged the bill’s potential to inflict further harm on assault victims and questioned its constitutionality, particularly its civil enforcement mechanism. However, he signed it, advising the legislature to amend unintended consequences later, although critics doubt swift action will follow. Idaho joins Texas, Missouri, and Oklahoma in passing restrictive abortion laws. Planned Parenthood and others have condemned Idaho’s law as dangerous and unconstitutional, stating it would inflict harm on hundreds of thousands of Idahoans."

Margie Montgomery, a co-founder and longtime executive director of the Kentucky Right to Life Association, is retiring after 50 years of work with the organization she helped form into an influential lobbying force against abortion.The association announced the retirement Thursday. Montgomery helped found Right to Life of Louisville in 1970 and Kentucky Right to Life in 1973. She has served as executive director of the state association since 1974.Montgomery also has served as chairwoman of the association's political action committee and has become a familiar presence in Frankfort over the years, lobbying for bills before the Kentucky General Assembly aimed at restricting or eliminating access to abortion.Montgomery could not be reached for comment Thursday.Read moreAmy McGrath outraises Mitch McConnell again in home stretch to Nov. 3Last year, she told The Courier Journal she was pleased with her organization's success in helping advance legislation meant to restrict abortion and promoting the election of more anti-abortion lawmakers. The state association was founded in 1973, the same year the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Roe v. Wade ruling upholding a woman's right to abortion.""I consider it one of the most important issues thats been around since 1973,"" Montgomery said in a 2019 interview. ""Who we put in office can make a big difference in the ultimate outcome. Thats why we have a Kentucky Right to Life political action committee.""While anti-abortion bills have been contested by supporters of abortion rights, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood, they have found support among lawmakers who oppose abortion.Sen.

Reproductive rights pioneer Bill Baird will appear on a Sharon-Stoughton League of Women Voters production on Zoom,"Reproductive rights pioneer Bill Baird will appear on a Sharon-Stoughton League of Women Voters production on ZoomSports Jobs Cars USA TODAY Weather Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals JOURNAL SUNSNYDER'S STOUGHTON Bill Baird still Zooming at 88Mark SnyderColumnistThe Sharon-Stoughton League of Women Voters is hosting reproductive rights pioneer Bill Baird live - in person - on Zoom from 7-8 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 3. It will include a QA period, monitored by the league.Baird was central to three U.S. Supreme Court cases that helped legalize birth control and abortion. In spite of all he has done, he has not been embraced by some major groups fighting for the same cause. It may be that he has not been able to convince them that he is sincerely interested in helping women, and some feminists have derided him as an outcast and a self-promoter.Anti-choice activists have shot at him, bombed his clinic - and even offered to pray for him. He was jailed eight times in five states in the 1960s for merely lecturing on abortion and birth control.I asked Baird how he came to the attention of our local League of Women Voters. He tells Snyder's Stoughton, ""I have known Steve Fradkin for many years. He's a good guy. I have talked to him and his wife, Sharon, throughout the years. I had worked for legalizing abortion and birth control for people at any age.""I had no patience with the opposition from the Church. It was not a popular stance in Catholic Boston. But I always felt don't make other people believe what you believe by law, and make criminals out of them, if they don't believe.""I ran a free clinic for years. Some of my patients were nuns. So, I knew priests were having sex with nuns. Then, the Cardinal sent me letters denigrating me. He ended up fleeing to the Vatican and died there, after the child sex abuse scandal.""We have separation of Church State. I said the Church was a multi-billion dollar corporation. I always wondered who should make a decision on an unwanted pregnancy? Should it be the government or you? Anyways, when Sharon reached out, I couldn't say no!""Baird told me, ""I have no fight if you want to believe in anything. I just don't want to be sent to jail for disagreeing with you. I tested the law, using the law's own verbiage. April 6, 1967 Time Magazine's cover pictured birth control pills. I pasted real birth control pills and St. Joseph Aspirin and asked if they wanted to arrest me.""I went after Cardinal Cushing's Rhythm Method booklet, which was selling for 10 cents. Why was that allowed, but not talks or writing on birth control? I carried the Bible, and illustrated the ""withdrawal method"" of birth control, which was portrayed in it 'spilling the seed.'.""If you were under 21, you were a minor. I gave a 19-year-old some contraceptive foam and a condom. Half a dozen police handcuffed me. I took out my Zayre's receipt for the foam. The attorney general was collecting a tax on it!""My goal was to implicate these multi-million dollar businesses. It would have made it easier for me. I called for the arrest of the AG. Yet, I was convicted. Eight-hundred BU students signed a petition asking me to come and talk about birth control. I told them no, originally. I had four little kids and a wife in NYC. I was told the Boston ACLU was there, and would have my back. James Hamilton, their director, went to the police station with me. Hamilton three weeks later, tells me your case has no constitutional value! ""I was from New York. I had good faith in the local people in Massachusetts. I called F. Lee Bailey. He had a murder case. Joe Balliro, a criminal attorney, took the case. I wanted to lose, because then I'd have a criminal case I could bring to the Supreme Court. Even though the chances are slim of getting there, but if they decided it, it would help so many young girls. I was mentioned five times in the Roe vs. Wade decision."" He continued, ""My biggest ally, on paper, was Planned Parenthood. But they told me there is nothing to be gained by the Baird case. He's an embarrassment. The National Organization of Women NOW wouldn't back me, even though I was fighting for women. The Boston newspaper and the Catholic Church called me the Devil. I came from NY to help the people of MA and the USA.""I lost my first wife and my four children when I was arrested on a morals charge. A 14-month-old baby was at my talk. They charged the mother, who allowed her baby in, and me. I faced three years in jail. We won the case. I got letters from all over the country threatening to kill my children. So, I had to leave NY - and them. We haven't spoken since. I cannot and will not reconcile with them. They knew what I went through at Charles Street jail. I had a very difficult time there."" Baird's lockup in Charles Street Jail in Boston featured rats in his cell, bugs in his food, lice on his prison mattress and humiliating body searches by guards.He continued, ""Their goal was to break me. The Supreme Court rejected me the first time. But, you have to write an appeal in a certain way, on certain paper, and it took several grand to write it, as they required. Playboy assisted me. I had no money. I was happy to take their funding. The feminists rejected me, and I was fighting for them. I'm not the sexual pied piper. I was just a guy who grew up in the Great Depression, and I lost my sister and a brother because we had no money for a doctor. This enabled me to become tough enough to have the courage to fight back."" Added Baird, ""Planned Parenthood sued me. Their literature in the 1960s opposed abortion. Money makes history. They rewrote their history. They take credit for legalizing birth control, but their case was for legally married couples in CT. I argued that anyone deserved that right. I fight for gays, women and Blacks. I'm not one of any of those groups."" So, why did he dedicate his life - and give up so much - to the cause of birth control and abortion rights? It's well documented that he was a medical school dropout who was working as clinical director at a pharmaceutical contraceptive company in 1963 when he was making a routine call to Harlem Hospital and witnessed the death of a woman from a self-attempted coat hanger abortion. The woman, a mother of nine, died in his arms.I vowed then to help my fellow poor gain access to the same rights and care that the wealthy were able to get back, when only women of means could get birth control and family planning services, he said.He went from bystander to activist, at that moment.His 1967 case Eisenstadt v. Baird led to the Supreme Court striking down a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people for the purpose of preventing pregnancy, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.Baird's three Supreme Court victories gave all teens and single women complete reproductive and birth control rights. He will share his story and view for the future of reproductive rights in his Zoom call.In my thirty minutes with him, he was nonstop. At 88, he's 100 cognitive, and still as motivated and passionate as ever about his cause. He spent quite a few years with death threats over his life, and his family's lives. His wife, Joni Baird, reached out to Father Pavone of Priests For Life, and both agreed to stop the hateful rhetoric aimed at each side. That helped ease the situation.Baird has devoted all of his adult life fighting for this cause, and still continues to speak publicly about his experiences, in particular, and the issue in general. The Sharon-Stoughton League, along with the LWV of MA and the LWV of US have studied reproductive rights issues over the years and have taken a position in support of these rights.

Throughout his career, Baird has faced intense opposition, including attacks from anti-abortion activists, arrests, and marginalization by certain feminist groups who viewed him skeptically. Despite this, he was instrumental in three landmark U.S. Supreme Court cases, including Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), which secured contraceptive rights for unmarried individuals.

Baird’s activism began in 1963 after witnessing the death of a woman who had attempted a self-induced abortion. This tragedy motivated him to fight for equitable access to reproductive care, which he saw as a matter of equal rights. His efforts led to clashes with the Catholic Church and legal authorities, particularly in conservative areas like Boston, where he ran a free clinic and often confronted religious and moral opposition. In one notable case, he was arrested for distributing contraceptives to a minor, aiming to challenge Massachusetts law.

Despite his advocacy and personal sacrifices, including the loss of his family and enduring jail conditions, he was frequently shunned by organizations like Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women (NOW), who labeled him a controversial figure. Nevertheless, his legal victories were referenced in the Roe v. Wade decision, further underscoring his impact on reproductive rights. Today, at 88, Baird continues to speak passionately on these issues and engage with audiences.

The League of Women Voters has long supported reproductive rights, and this event highlights their ongoing commitment to civic education. The League has also planned additional programs on related social and political issues. Baird’s appearance is expected to offer insight into the history and future of reproductive rights in the U.S., with pre-registration required for attendance."
Spike in Maltese women seeking abortion help amid flight ban - UK charity,"Spike in Maltese women seeking abortion help amid flight ban - UK charity A UK-based charity offering support to those living in countries with restrictive abortion laws has seen an increase in calls from Maltese women unable to travel to have an abortion. Last week Abortion Support Network received eight calls from Malta the same number it usually deals with in one month, founder Mara Klein Clarke said. Most of the women who called were seeking advice on how to terminate their pregnancies with the travel ban meaning they can not fly to the UK, Klein Clarke told Times of Malta. Around 300-400 Maltese women are estimated to travel abroad to have an abortion, which is illegal in Malta. RELATED STORIESJoseph Muscat wants national debate on abortion Klein Clarke said that the flight ban meant even those with financial means to travel to terminate a pregnancy, could no longer do so. Now any woman with an unplanned pregnancy is going to have the experience of a poor woman with an unplanned pregnancy, so Im really hoping that this will put pressure on the government to change the law, she said. She said that women who were resorting to sourcing medical abortion pills faced the problem of delays due to coronavirus measures. She said that in the absence of abortion pills, other measures women took to terminate unwanted pregnancies were spine-chilling and she hoped the authorities in Malta would re-examine the issue. Around 200 women in Malta purchase abortion pills online every year, according to Dr Gilbert Gravino from Doctors for Choice. While the pill was generally safe to be used by most women, he explained there are those who cannot use this method of termination and rely on abortion clinics abroad either because of health issues such as blood disorders, or because of the stage of the pregnancy. Another issue, he said, was that women currently in abusive relationships and trapped with their aggressors due to lockdown measures, were ending up with unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape within their own homes.

Normally, the charity receives about eight calls per month from Malta, but it received the same number just last week. Abortions are illegal in Malta, leading an estimated 300-400 women to travel abroad annually for the procedure, but the flight restrictions now prevent even those who can afford to travel from doing so.

Mara Klein Clarke, the charity’s founder, highlighted that the ban forces all women with unplanned pregnancies to experience the same challenges as those without financial means, underscoring a need for legal reform. With travel restrictions in place, some women are turning to abortion pills, although these have been delayed due to COVID-19 measures. Additionally, accessing abortion pills is not suitable for everyone, as Dr. Gilbert Gravino of Doctors for Choice explained, citing medical concerns like blood disorders or advanced pregnancy stages.

Another issue exacerbated by lockdowns is the rise in unwanted pregnancies among women trapped in abusive relationships, sometimes resulting from sexual assault within the home. Clarke and Gravino hope these challenges will prompt Maltese authorities to reconsider their stance on abortion, particularly in light of the unsafe alternatives some women may resort to under the current restrictions."
Clinics appeal to FL Supreme Court's conservative bent in fighting abortion ban ‚Ä¢ Florida Phoenix,"Clinics appeal to FL Supreme Court's conservative bent in fighting abortion ban Florida Phoenix HOME NEWS Education Health Politics Law Environment Culture Society Working The Economy Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 100 News Story Civil Rights ImmigrationCulture SocietyPolitics Law Clinics appeal to FL Supreme Courts conservative bent in fighting abortion ban Overwhelming weight of textual and historical evidence supports access By Michael Moline - March 1, 2023 100 am Abortion rights protesters gather in front of the Florida Supreme Court on May 3, 2022. Credit Danielle J. Brown Attorneys for a group of abortion clinics are pleading with the Florida Supreme Court not to overrule decades of precedent protecting access to the procedure under the Florida Constitution, citing the plain text of that documents Privacy Clause and the danger to millions of Florida women. Arguments, filed Tuesday on behalf of Planned Parenthood and other clinics plus a doctor who provides abortion care, point to the plain text of the Privacy Clause, which Florida voters adopted in 1980 Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the persons private life except as otherwise provided herein. This section shall not be construed to limit the publics right of access to public records and meetings as provided by law. Such a broad freedom in private and personal matters necessarily extends to the profound and personal decision whether to have an abortion or to bear the substantial pains, risks, and life-altering consequences of pregnancy and childbirth, the brief says. The pleading looks like an attempt to remind the courts majority of their purported conservative principles as remade by Gov. Ron DeSantis since first taking office in 2019, the court majority has amply demonstrated willingness to second-guess precedents established by earlier, more moderate or liberal, courts. Like the one that found in 1989 that the Privacy Clause protects abortion rights. The state will file a reply brief at a later date. At issue is HB 5, passed last year, which bans abortions beginning 15 weeks following the last menstrual period without exceptions for rape or incest only to preserve maternal life and health or when the fetus is unlikely to survive. Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper struck down the law as violating the Privacy Clause and issued an injunction against its enforcement. However, an intermediate state appellate lifted the injunction, allowing the laws enforcement as of July 1 last year. Fact findings The brief argues that appeals courts are obliged to accept a trial courts findings of fact in legal disputes, because the trial judge would have vetted the evidence closely and assessed the personal credibility of witnesses. Here, Judge Cooper found that the Legislatures arguments for banning abortion after 15 weeks were all wrong, the brief continues for example, the law does not prevent fetal pain because fetuses feel pain only around the viability stage, and that the ban actively threatens maternal health because pregnancy is so much more dangerous than undergoing abortion both factors supported by overwhelming medical evidence. Yet the First District Court of appeal ignored those findings, the brief argues. It also ignored extensive precedent allowing the clinics to pursue claims on behalf of their patients, who might not have the means or time to file lawsuits on their own behalf. Furthermore, the state can legitimately override that conclusion only when the texts explicit language says it can, the clinics team wrote and there is no basis in the text of the Privacy Clause to artificially constrain its broad, ordinary meaning to exclude a right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. The language seems aimed at countering arguments raised by the state earlier in the litigation that the amendment was intended to protect mainly data privacy. The privacy amendment was a direct response to Florida Supreme Court rulings before 1980 holding that notwithstanding the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade the Florida Constitution did not establish a privacy right to abortion. The historical context reflects that the 1980 amendment was intended to remedy these omissions, the brief says. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe, but theres ample legal authority for allowing states to enforce rights independent of federal law, it says, even if federal protection recedes. Furthermore, widespread local news coverage in 1980 linked Floridas privacy amendment to broad privacy rights and privacy rights to abortion, the brief argues. For example, contemporaneous news coverage routinely identified the proposed amendment as creating a broad privacy right under Florida law that at minimum incorporated the constellation of privacy rights then-recognized under federal law, and routinely identified abortion as part of federal privacy rights, it continues. The overwhelming weight of textual and historical evidence counsels strongly in favor of upholding established case law uniformly concluding that Floridas fundamental right to privacy protects abortion rights, it reads. The plaintiffs attorneys then threw the words of the Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the original originalists, at the Florida justices Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or yes even future judges think that scope too broad.

The appeal emphasizes the state constitution’s Privacy Clause, established in 1980, which guarantees individuals the right to be “let alone and free from governmental intrusion.” The attorneys argue that this clause extends to personal decisions like abortion, pointing out that the intent of the 1980 amendment was to secure privacy rights broader than federal protections, which, at that time, included the right to abortion.

The case challenges HB 5, a law passed in Florida that prohibits most abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions only to preserve maternal health or when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb. Initially, Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper ruled the law unconstitutional, but a state appellate court later allowed its enforcement. The appeal to the Supreme Court criticizes the appellate court for disregarding established legal precedents and Judge Cooper’s findings, which argued that the law does not align with medical evidence, fails to prevent fetal pain, and endangers maternal health, as pregnancy carries greater risks than abortion.

The plaintiffs contend that the Privacy Clause’s language supports a broad right to privacy, covering abortion decisions, contrary to state arguments that limit the clause primarily to data privacy. They also cite historical and legal evidence, including public opinion from 1980, to argue that the amendment was broadly understood to protect privacy rights, including abortion. In support of their position, they quote conservative Justice Antonin Scalia’s view that constitutional rights should be upheld as understood at the time they were adopted, urging the conservative-leaning Florida Supreme Court to respect this interpretation and refrain from overturning precedent."

Photograph Steve SanchezPacific PressRexShutterstockOpinionAbortion This article is more than 2 years oldWhite nationalists are flocking to the US anti-abortion movementThis article is more than 2 years oldMoira DoneganThe white supremacist and anti-choice movements have always been closely linked. But more and more, they are becoming difficult to tell apartMon 24 Jan 2022 12.12 CETLast modified on Mon 24 Jan 2022 17.01 CETShareThis weekends March for Life rally, the large anti-choice demonstration held annually in Washington DC to mark the anniversary of the Roe v Wade decision, has the exuberant quality of a victory lap. This, the 49th anniversary of Roe, is likely to be its last. The US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe in Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health, which is set to be decided this spring. For women in Texas, Roe has already been nullified the court went out of its way to allow what Justice Sonia Sotomayor called a flagrantly unconstitutional abortion ban to go into effect there, depriving abortion rights to the one in 10 American women of reproductive age who live in the nations second largest state.These victories have made visible a growing cohort within the anti-choice movement the militias and explicitly white supremacist groups of the organized far right. Like last year, this years March for Life featured an appearance by Patriot Front, a white nationalist group that wears a uniform of balaclavas and khakis. The group, which also marched at a Chicago March for Life demonstration earlier this month, silently handed out cards to members of the press who tried to ask them questions. America belongs to its fathers, and it is owed to its sons, the cards read. The restoration of American sovereignty must follow the restoration of the American Family.Explicit white nationalism, and an emphasis on conscripting white women into reproduction, is not a fringe element of the anti-choice movement. Associations between white supremacist groups and anti-abortion forces are robust and longstanding. In addition to Patriot Front, groups like the white nationalist Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Traditionalist Worker party have also lent support to the anti-abortion movement. These groups see stopping abortion as part of a broader project to ensure white hegemony in addition to womens subordination. Tim Bishop, of the Aryan Nations, noted that Lots of our people join anti-choice organizations Its part of our Holy War for the pure Aryan race. That the growing white nationalist movement would be focused on attacking womens rights is maybe to be expected research has long established that recruitment to the alt-right happens largely among men with grievances against feminism, and that misogyny is usually the first form of rightwing radicalization.But the affinity goes both ways just as the alt-right loves the anti-choice movement, the anti-choice movement loves the alt-right. In 2019, Kristen Hatten, a vice-president at the anti-choice group New Wave Feminists, shared racist content online and publicly identified herself as an ethnonationalist. In addition to sharing personnel, the groups share tactics. In 1985, the KKK began circulating Wanted posters featuring the photos and personal information of abortion providers. The posters were picked up by the anti-choice terrorist group Operation Rescue in the early 90s. Now, sharing names, photos and addresses of abortion providers and clinic staff is standard practice in the mainline anti-choice movement, and the stalking and doxing of providers has become routine. More recently, anti-abortion activists have escalated their violence, returning to the murderous extremism that characterized the movement in the 1990s in Knoxville, a fire that burned down a planned parenthood clinic on New Years Eve was ruled an arson. Maybe the anti-choice crowd is taking tips from their friends in the alt-right.Its not that the anti-abortion movements embrace of white nationalism is totally uncomplicated. When the Traditionalist Worker party showed up at a Tennessee Right to Life march in 2018, the organizers shooed them off, and later issued a statement saying they condemned violence both from the right, and from leftwing groups like antifa. Hatten was fired from her anti-choice job after a public outcry. The anti-choice movement has even started trying to appropriate the language of social justice. They posit equality between embryos and women, try to brand abortion bans as feminist, incessantly compare abortion to the Holocaust, and claim that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation, in the words of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. Anti-choice groups are eager to claim the moral authority of historical struggles against oppression, even as they work to further the oppression of women.But the link between the anti-choice movement and white supremacy is much older and more fundamental than this recent, superficial social justice branding effort. Before an influx of southern and eastern European immigrants to the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, abortion and contraception had only been partially and sporadically criminalized. This changed in the early 20th century, when an additional surge of migrants from Asia and Latin America calcified white American racial anxieties and led to white elites decrying the falling white birth rate as race suicide.Abortion bans were quickly introduced nationwide. As the historian Leslie Raegan put it, White male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white Protestant women. The emerging popular eugenics movement supported this campaign of forced birth for fit mothers, while at the same time implementing a widespread campaign of involuntary sterilization among the poor, particularly Black women and incarcerated women. Meanwhile, white women who sought out voluntary sterilization were discouraged or outright denied the procedure, a practice that is still mainstream in the medical field today.In the current anti-choice and white supremacist alliance, the language of race suicide has been supplanted by a similar fear the so-called Great Replacement, a racist conspiracy theory that posits that white Americans are being replaced by people of color. Some antisemitic variations posit that this replacement is somehow being orchestrated by Jewish people.The way to combat this, the right says, is to force childbearing among white people, to severely restrict immigration, and to punish, via criminalization and enforced poverty, women of color. These anxieties have always animated the anti-choice movement, and they have only become more fervent among the March for Lifes rank and file as conservatives become increasingly fixated on the demographic changes that will make America a minority-white country sometime in the coming decades. The white supremacist and anti-choice movements have always been closely linked. But more and more, they are becoming difficult to tell apart.

All rights reserved. dcr","The article by Moira Donegan highlights the growing and increasingly visible connection between white nationalist groups and the U.S. anti-abortion movement. As the Supreme Court prepares to potentially overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, the anti-abortion movement is seeing a rise in participation from far-right and white supremacist groups like Patriot Front and Aryan Nations. These groups align with the anti-choice movement not only over shared concerns about abortion but also due to their focus on maintaining white hegemony and encouraging white women to bear children to counteract demographic changes they view as threatening to the white population.

The connection between white nationalism and anti-abortion views is not new, as historical precedents trace back to the early 20th century, when white elites, concerned with immigration and falling white birth rates, pushed for stricter abortion laws. This was tied to eugenics, which sought to limit reproduction among marginalized groups while encouraging it among white women. The modern anti-abortion movement, however, has adopted more sophisticated rhetoric, like equating abortion bans with feminism or historical civil rights struggles, even as it continues to share tactics with far-right extremist groups, including doxing abortion providers.

The piece also discusses how the anti-abortion movement and white nationalist ideologies share fears about “race suicide” or the “Great Replacement,” which posits that white Americans are being replaced by non-white immigrants. To address this perceived threat, these groups advocate for policies that restrict abortion access, limit immigration, and punish women of color. The growing convergence of these movements makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between them. Donegan argues that while there are occasional attempts by anti-abortion groups to distance themselves from extremism, the historical and current links between the two ideologies remain strong and undeniable."

Andrew Cuomo has been center stage throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as his state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 263,000 confirmed cases and 16,000 deaths.As Cuomo became a more recognizable face amid the pandemic, a viral Facebook post from March 25 claimed, ""Human life is not disposable, said NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, the man who recently signed a bill legalizing abortion up until birth.""More Gov. Andrew Cuomo showed a mural of donated masks to New York. Then social media weighed inNew York's abortion lawNew York state's abortion law has previously been the subject of misinformation. It became a talking point when Cuomo signed abortion legislation codifying Roe vs. Wade into state law in January 2019. New York's Reproductive Health Act allows practitioners to perform an abortion on a patient who is 24 weeks or more away from the start of a pregnancy if the fetus is not viable or the abortion is necessary ""to protect the patient's life or health.""The law does not define ""health"" or viability of a fetus. The determination of these factors must be made by a ""health care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized"" under state law, ""acting within his or her lawful scope of practice."" Before Cuomo signed the legislation, abortions after 24 weeks were allowed only when the mother's life was at risk. They otherwise were criminalized.The Reproductive Health Act also removed abortion from the state's penal code, and the statute still defines a person as a ""human being who has been born and is alive."" Killing a baby once born is still considered homicide. Typically, pregnancies range from 38 to 42 weeks and babies are considered viable at 37 weeks. Across the country 43 states restrict abortion by gestational age.19 states ban abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy.5 states ban abortion at 24 weeks of pregnancy.18 states ban abortion based on viability of the fetus.Alabama has the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S., banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy and for any reason, including in cases of rape and incest. The law is on hold after a federal judge ruled the ban ""defies the United States Constitution."" Virginia has a more lenient law than Alabama in terms of time frame and bans abortion at the third trimester, which begins at 25 weeks. A 2018 report from the CDC found that in 2015, there were 638,169 reported abortions in the U.S. Of those, 65 of the procedures were performed at or before the eight-week mark and 91 were performed at or before the 13-week mark. Only 1.3 of abortions recorded were performed at 21 weeks or later. Our rating Partly falseWe rate the claim in the Facebook post as PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. While it is true that New York's abortion law allows procedures after 24 weeks, there are rules guiding that procedure if the fetus is not viable or if the health or life of the mother is at risk. If medical practitioners determine that either of these factors are present, the mother can choose to have an abortion. It is false to state or imply that any abortion can occur in New York ""up until birth"" as the social posts claims. That is misleading. Additionally, no state in the U.S. allows abortion ""up until birth.""Our fact-check sourcesNew York consolidated laws, article 125New York Reproductive Health ActAL HB314Business Insider, Here's the latest point in pregnancy you can get an abortion in all 50 statesCDC, Abortion Surveillance, United States 2015 Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices Copyright Gannett 2024","The claim that New York’s abortion law allows abortions “up until birth” is misleading. The law, known as the Reproductive Health Act, allows abortions after 24 weeks only under specific circumstances: if the fetus is not viable or if the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health. The determination of viability or health risks is made by a licensed healthcare provider. Prior to this law, abortions after 24 weeks were allowed only when the mother’s life was at risk.

The law does not permit unrestricted abortions at any point in pregnancy. New York removed abortion from its penal code, but it still defines a “person” as a human being who has been born and is alive, and killing a baby after birth is considered homicide.

While New York’s law permits some late-term abortions, it follows strict guidelines and does not allow abortions “up until birth.” This claim is partly false, as no state in the U.S. allows abortion at any time during pregnancy."

In that case, Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the courts four more liberal justices in concluding that the law made it harder for women to obtain abortions while not doing anything, despite the states argument to the contrary, to protect the health of pregnant women. Today the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a similar law from Louisiana. But with Kennedy now retired, the laws fate seemed likely to hinge on the vote of Chief Justice John Roberts or perhaps Kennedys successor, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The dispute before the court this morning centered on the constitutionality of a 2014 law known as the Louisiana Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, which requires doctors who perform abortions in Louisiana to have the right to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of the place where the abortion is performed. In 2018, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to the law, concluding that it did not impose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women. The challengers doctors who perform abortions and an abortion clinic went to the Supreme Court last year, asking the justices to temporarily bar the state from enforcing the law until they could file a petition for review of the lower courts decision. A divided court agreed to stay the lower courts ruling, with Chief Justice John Roberts a dissenter in the Texas case joining the courts four more liberal justices in voting to stay the 5th Circuits ruling. In April, the challengers filed their petition for review the Supreme Court granted that petition, as well as a related petition filed by the state, in early October. Arguing on behalf of the abortion providers, lawyer Julie Rikelman told the justices that this case is about respect for the courts precedent. The Louisiana admitting-privileges requirement, Rikelman emphasized, was expressly modeled on the Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016 and will do nothing for womens health. Nothing has changed, Rikelman continued, that would justify such a legal about-face from the courts 2016 ruling. Rikelman quickly faced a barrage of questions from Justice Samuel Alito regarding whether her clients had a legal right to challenge the Louisiana law, known as standing, at all. Should a plaintiff be able to sue to protect the rights of others, Alito asked, when there is a conflict between the plaintiffs interests and the interests of the individuals whose rights the plaintiff seeks to protect? When Rikelman responded that a plaintiff should be able to sue when she is directly regulated by the law at issue, Alito was incredulous. Thats amazing, he told Rikelman. Rikelman pushed back, arguing that the state had waived its ability to challenge her clients right to sue. She received an assist from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who observed that the state hadnt raised the issue until its cross-petition in the Supreme Court. The abortion providers might have joined a patient or two if the state had flagged the question earlier, Ginsburg indicated. Jeffrey B. Wall, Principal Deputy Solicitor General Art Lien Justice Stephen Breyer was also uninclined to agree that the abortion providers lacked standing to sue on behalf of their patients. Breyer announced that he had found at least eight cases in which the Supreme Court had allowed abortion providers to sue on behalf of their patients. Why, he asked Jeffrey Wall, the deputy U.S. solicitor general who argued on behalf of the federal government as a friend of the court supporting Louisiana, should we depart from what was pretty clear precedent? Wall answered that the Supreme Court has never signed off on the right to sue for abortion providers who, like the providers in this case, have an actual conflict of interest. Significantly, although Justices Clarence Thomas who argued in his dissent in the Texas case that the abortion providers lacked a right to sue and Neil Gorsuch did not ask any questions, neither Roberts nor Kavanaugh seemed to express any interest in the standing question, suggesting that there may not be five votes to dismiss the case on this ground. Roberts repeatedly returned to the question of how the justices should apply their 2016 decision in the Texas case, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, to this case. Is the inquiry under Whole Womans Health, he first asked Rikelman, a factual one that has to be conducted state by state? For example, Roberts posited, the district court would examine the availability of doctors and clinics in a particular state, so that the results could be different in different states. Roberts view on this question could be important If he concludes that the Whole Womans Health inquiry is a factual one that is conducted state by state, it could allow him to find some daylight between the Louisiana law and the Texas law that the court struck down four years ago. Rikelman acknowledged that the burdens of a law may vary according to the law at issue, but she stressed that an admitting-privileges law has no benefits and is therefore more likely to be a burden in every state. Kavanaugh then pressed Rikelman as well. If the admitting-privileges law did not have any effect that is, if all the doctors could get admitting privileges would the law still be an undue burden and therefore unconstitutional? Rikelman conceded that such a case would be very different, but she reiterated that there would still be no benefit to the law. Elizabeth Murrill, Louisiana Solicitor General Art Lien Roberts had a similar question about how to apply Whole Womans Health for Elizabeth Murrill, Louisianas solicitor general. Do you agree, he asked Murrill, that a courts inquiry into the benefits of an abortion law will be the same in each state? Murrill disagreed. A state could show that a law has more benefits depending on the state, she answered. Much of the rest of the argument was spent discussing whether Louisianas admitting-privileges law actually has any benefits, and whether the states abortion providers had really made an effort to obtain privileges at nearby hospitals. Ginsburg described the requirement that an abortion provider obtain privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where she performs abortions as odd. Most abortions dont result in any complications, she suggested, and even if a woman who has had an abortion needs to go to a hospital, she will go to the hospital that is closest to her home, not the hospital closest to the abortion clinic. These laws, Ginsburg asserted, will always put barriers to abortion while serving no benefit. Wall resisted Ginsburgs contention that the 30-mile requirement serves no purpose. All admitting-privilege requirements have some geographical limit, he began. And even if there was no evidence in the Texas case that women who needed to be hospitalized were transferred to the hospital from the clinic, there is such evidence in this case even if we dont know how often it happens, Wall said. Justice Elena Kagan, who asked relatively few questions, posited that the admitting-privileges requirement does not necessarily guarantee that doctors who perform abortions are qualified to do so. In Whole Womans Health, she told Murrill, the court held that the state cannot say it is imposing an admitting-privileges requirement for credentialing reasons if hospitals are denying applications for admitting privileges for other reasons for example, because doctors dont admit enough patients to the hospital or because doctors perform abortions. But Wall countered that in a case like this, when the law has not yet gone into effect, all the challengers ought to have put their applications where their mouths are They should have at least applied for admitting privileges before going to court to block the law from being enforced, so that the court could know for certain whether they really cant get admitting privileges. And Murrill was even stronger, telling the justices that there was evidence that the challengers who had applied for admitting privileges had sabotaged their own applications. Alito appeared sympathetic to this argument. Referring to one doctor, known only as Doe 2, Alito suggested that it would be against the doctors own interests to make a super effort to get admitting privileges, because hed be defeating his own claim. Doe 2 has previously had admitting privileges at a hospital in Shreveport, Alito noted, but he didnt apply for privileges again because it was a Catholic hospital and he presumably believed that he wouldnt obtain them, but another doctor, known as Doe 3, did obtain admitting privileges at that hospital. At one point, Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to throw up his hands. Were not going to solve this at oral argument, he told Murrill. But the justices will meet to vote on the case later this week, and a decision is expected by summer. This post was originally published at Howe on the Court.

SAVE ACCEPT","The Supreme Court’s consideration of Louisiana’s 2014 Unsafe Abortion Protection Act centered on whether a law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals was constitutional. This law mirrored a Texas law struck down in 2016 by the Court in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. In the 2016 case, the Court ruled that such laws imposed unnecessary burdens on women’s access to abortions without advancing health protections.

In the Louisiana case, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were pivotal figures, as Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had been influential in the Texas case, had retired. Louisiana’s law required that doctors performing abortions must have the right to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic, but this provision had not been shown to provide significant health benefits, raising concerns among those challenging the law.

Julie Rikelman, arguing for the abortion providers, emphasized that the law’s provisions mirrored the Texas law and would similarly burden women’s access to abortion without improving health outcomes. The challengers contended that the law was primarily an obstacle rather than a health safeguard. However, during oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito raised concerns about whether the abortion providers had standing (the right to sue), suggesting that there may have been a conflict of interest since they could benefit from the law’s burdens. This prompted responses from other justices, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who noted that the state had not raised the standing issue until late in the proceedings.

In addressing the law’s potential impact, Chief Justice Roberts questioned whether the Whole Woman’s Health analysis should be state-specific, meaning courts would have to evaluate the law’s impact in Louisiana differently than in Texas. This raised the possibility that Roberts might find the Louisiana law different enough from Texas’s to warrant a different outcome. Justices Kavanaugh and Ginsburg also engaged in discussions on whether the law provided tangible benefits, with Ginsburg arguing that the law’s requirements could harm women without improving healthcare access, especially given that complications from abortion are rare.

The Court also discussed whether the challengers had adequately tried to meet the law’s requirements, with some justices, like Alito, suggesting that providers might have undermined their own applications for admitting privileges.

Ultimately, the Court’s decision was anticipated later in the year, and much of the argument focused on how to apply previous precedents, the practical impacts of such laws, and the extent to which the Louisiana law was justified by health concerns."

Facebook Twitter Print Email 27 March 2020 WomenThe United Nations Population Fund UNFPA is pledging support for those suffering from invisible impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including women and girls whose access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health care may be disrupted. In a statement on Friday, Executive Director of the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, Natalia Kanem, said the Funds work is ramping up even as the novel coronavirus continues to test health care systems around the world. Tweet URL As we continue responding to the coronavirus outbreak, UNFPA is calling for renewed action to provide life-saving sexual and reproductive health for the world's most vulnerable.See Atayeshe's statement pic.twitter.comiWppYYdJsl UNFPA She warned that women, girls and health workers must not be overlooked as the world responds to the greatest health crisis in a century. Women and girls most vulnerable As in most crises, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to critical sexual and reproductive health services and hampered authorities ability to respond to gender-based violence, at a time when women and girls need these services most. UNFPA is helping governments prioritize the special needs of women and girls often the most vulnerable in times of crises in line with the Funds goals of ending unmet need for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, gender-based violence and harmful practices by 2030. In his appeal for a global ceasefire amid the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this week, Secretary-General Antnio Guterres emphasized that women and children are among the most vulnerable in times of war and face the highest risk of suffering devastating losses from the pandemic. UNFPA has appealed to donors to fund its response plan, which targets countries with weak public health systems including countries in fragile and humanitarian situations. It is provisionally projecting that it will need 187.5 million. Efforts will focus on bolstering health systems, procuring and delivering essential supplies to protect health workers, ensuring access to reproductive health and gender-based violence services, and promoting risk communication and community engagement. Invisible impacts of COVID-19 As communities around the globe grapple with the most immediate effects of the pandemic, overwhelmed healthcare systems and populations in quarantine can also suffer a ripple of additional impacts. Now is a time for solidarity, resolve and selflessness. We must not forget that there are people we may not immediately see, who are at great risk as a result of the consequences of the crisis, said Dr. Kanem. Those can include pregnant women who require antenatal care but are unsure whether it is safe to go to the clinic, as well as women in abusive relationships trapped at home for the foreseeable future and fearing for their safety. Coronavirus Portal News Updates Readers can find information and guidance on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV from the UN, World Health Organization and UN agencies here. For daily news updates from UN News, click here. Dr. Kanem also pointed to tens of millions of people living in refugee camps for whom social distancing practices are not an option and older people around the globe who remain isolated and starved of social interaction as they avoid infection. Meeting intimate, yet essential needs UNFPA is working to support affected health systems, in particular by distributing material support to protect health workers and midwives. In China, Iran and the Philippines, it has distributed essential hygiene and other items to the most vulnerable and personal protective equipment to health workers. In the Republic of Moldova, it has launched an online dashboard which disaggregates the countrys current caseload by location, sex, age and pregnancy status. However, Dr. Kanem stressed that more work is needed to ensure that the most intimate yet essential needs of women and girls are met as the world continues to battle COVID-19 in the months ahead. This global scourge requires a global response, she said, urging the international community to stand up for the dignity and health of women as part of its efforts.

UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem emphasized the importance of ensuring access to essential health services, especially for pregnant women and survivors of violence, who may be more isolated due to quarantine measures. The organization is working to bolster healthcare systems, distribute protective equipment to health workers, and provide reproductive health services. Efforts are also focused on supporting countries with weak healthcare systems, and UNFPA has appealed for a funding target of $187.5 million to continue these efforts.

In addition to physical health concerns, Kanem stressed the mental and social impacts of the pandemic, such as the isolation of older individuals and the inability of refugees to practice social distancing. UNFPA’s response includes initiatives like online dashboards in Moldova to track cases by sex, age, and pregnancy status, and distributing hygiene products and protective equipment in countries like China, Iran, and the Philippines.

The UNFPA’s response emphasizes the need for solidarity and a global effort to ensure the dignity and health of women and girls during this unprecedented global health crisis."

Republican Gov. Jim Pillen, who pushed for the bill and met with various lawmakers to shore up support, has promised to sign it into law.The mood in the Nebraska Capitol has been volatile since lawmakers on Tuesday advanced by a single vote the hybrid measure that ties together restrictions that Republicans across the U.S. have been pushing. Nebraska's lawmakers have traded insults and promises of retribution, while protesters have loudly voiced their displeasure. Nebraska's ban comes the same week North Carolina affirmed a 12-week ban on abortion, overriding that governor's veto. Friday's debate was briefly stopped when protesters in a chamber balcony stood and yelled obscenities at conservative lawmakers while throwing what appeared to be bloody tampons onto the floor. Security arrested at least one person and cleared the balconies. As lawmakers began voting, chants of, ""Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!"" could be heard coming from outside the chamber.Nebraska had not passed a new abortion ban since the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. The state currently bans abortion starting around 20 weeks of pregnancy. The 12-week ban includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. The bill also would prevent transgender people 18 or younger from receiving any gender-confirming surgery. The state's chief medical officer a political appointee who is currently an ear, nose and throat doctor would set rules for puberty blockers and hormone therapies. There would be some exceptions for minors who were already receiving treatment before the ban was enacted.At least 17 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for minors, and proposals are pending before the governors of Texas and Missouri. Medical groups and advocates say such restrictions are further marginalizing transgender youth and threatening their health.Omaha Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh led an effort to filibuster nearly every bill this session even ones she supported to protest the proposed restrictions on gender-affirming care. She railed against conservatives who voted for the hybrid bill and warned that people, medical professionals and businesses will leave the state over it.Cavanaugh declared in early March that she would ""burn the session to the ground over this bill,"" and she and a handful of progressive allies followed through. They introduced hundreds of amendments and motions to slow every bill at each stage of debate, impeding the work of the Legislature and sending leadership scrambling to prioritize which bills to push through. After lawmakers merged the abortion limits with the transgender health bill, Cavanaugh clashed with Sen. Julie Slama, who insinuated that conservatives were supporting the restrictions on gender-affirming care to retaliate against Cavanaugh. Slama noted that the restrictions did not initially have the 33 votes needed to survive.""But then Machaela Cavanaugh got up and ran her mouth because she was just overjoyed that the national media was here to give her some more attention,"" Slama said. ""So that gave us 33 votes.""Cavanaugh responded that it would ""cost"" conservatives with just days left in the session for lawmakers to pass bills. ""I am going to take all of the time. Every single, solitary minute of it to make sure the speaker has to decide what actually gets scheduled in these last handful of days,"" she said.Conservatives in the one-house, officially nonpartisan Legislature announced early this month that they would amend the trans health bill to squeeze in the abortion restrictions. That unconventional move came after conservatives failed to advance a bill that would have banned abortion once cardiac activity can be detected generally around six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Legislative rules state that a bill failing to defeat a filibuster must be tabled for the year. So opponents were surprised when conservatives announced a plan for a 12-week ban. Progressive lawmakers say it was an underhanded way to ramrod through a ban after the issue already failed. Conservatives say the ban is as a compromise.Because an emergency clause is attached to the bill, it will take once the governor signs it. More from CBS News Transcript Reps.

Not Now Turn On","On May 19, 2023, Nebraska lawmakers passed a contentious bill that bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and imposes strict limits on gender-affirming care for minors. The bill, which will be signed into law by Republican Governor Jim Pillen, was a result of intense political wrangling. Conservative lawmakers managed to secure enough votes to end a filibuster, with strong support from the governor, who lobbied for the bill’s passage.

The bill also limits transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming surgery and places further regulations on treatments such as hormone therapies and puberty blockers, which would be overseen by the state’s chief medical officer. There are exceptions for minors who are already receiving treatment before the law takes effect. Nebraska’s abortion law includes exceptions for rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk.

This legislation is part of a broader trend in the U.S., with over 17 states having enacted similar laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors. The bill has sparked significant protest, with demonstrators disrupting legislative sessions and voicing their discontent. Progressive lawmakers, particularly Senator Machaela Cavanaugh, led a filibuster to delay the vote, citing concerns over the bill’s impact on transgender youth and the state’s reputation. The maneuvering around the bill’s passage included a controversial tactic of merging the abortion ban with the gender-affirming care restrictions, after an earlier effort to impose a more restrictive six-week abortion ban had failed.

The passage of this bill has created a deeply polarized atmosphere in Nebraska, with lawmakers and protesters alike expressing strong emotions, leading some to warn of future political and social consequences. The law is expected to go into effect shortly after the governor signs it."

Join our Lenten Campaign 2024. PLEASE MAKE A DONATION TO ALETEIAA new study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute asked Canadians to express their views on abortion. The survey, which was posed to 1,805 respondents, found that the majority of Canadians surveyed are unabashedly pro-choice, with a miniscule portion of the nation holding wholly pro-life views. Furthermore, even those who consider their faith to play an important role in their life are unlikely to follow pro-life ideals. Majority pro-choiceAccording to the data, just over half of Canadians 52 consider themselves completely pro-choice, while the portion of those who consider themselves completely pro-life makes up just 8 of respondents. The remaining 41 say they are somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum. It should be noted that the figures were rounded up to the nearest percentage point, which is why these numbers add up to 101. Those who fall within the in between group have varying opinions on how far into a pregnancy abortion should be allowed. Over a third 36 said that they were comfortable allowing abortions to be performed up to 15 weeks into the pregnancy. Nearly a quarter, however, said abortion should be allowed until fetal viability, between 23 and 24 weeks. Meanwhile, a solid third 33 said they were unsure. Faith no guaranteeWile faith was found to be a factor, a strong faith is no guarantee of pro-life views among Canadians. Of those who said their faith was an important factor in their lives, only 40 said they were completely pro-life. This group was nearly as likely 39 to say that they were somewhere between the two stances. Over a fifth 21 of respondents who place importance on faith consider themselves completely pro-choice. Respondents were asked to consider the rights of the unborn, especially those which have reached the fetal viability stage. Nearly three-fifths 58 said that the mothers rights should supersede those of the viable fetus. Only 22 responded that the rights of a viable fetus should be equal to those of the mothers. This latter response was more commonly held by men, but all demographics leaned towards rights of the woman taking precedence. The Angus Reid Institute noted that this is the second of a three part survey. The previous iteration focused on Canadians personal experiences with abortion whether they had one or carried an unwanted pregnancy to term. The third survey will ask Canadians their opinions of abortion laws and whether the nation needs more guarantees or restrictions to abortion.Read moreSurvey Most Catholics dont want Church to change with the timesRead moreSurvey Many Catholics want to share faith, but need tools and trainingTagsAbortionCanadaMedicinePro-lifeSupport Aleteia!Enjoying your time on Aleteia?

The survey, conducted with 1,805 respondents, revealed that 52% of Canadians are fully pro-choice, while 41% hold mixed opinions on abortion, with some accepting it up to 15 weeks, others allowing it until fetal viability (23-24 weeks), and a third unsure.

The study also highlighted the influence of faith on attitudes toward abortion. While 40% of respondents who considered faith important identified as pro-life, nearly the same percentage (39%) were more moderate, with 21% being fully pro-choice. Regarding the rights of viable fetuses, 58% of Canadians believe that the mother’s rights should take precedence, while only 22% equate the rights of the fetus with those of the mother. This view was more common among men, though overall, most demographics favored prioritizing the woman’s rights.

This survey is part of a three-phase series. The first part focused on personal experiences with abortion, and the final part will address Canadians’ opinions on abortion laws and potential restrictions."

Kanye West meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in 2018. AFP via Getty Images KEY FACTS Planned Parenthood has long refuted the claims that it was founded on racist ideals and alluded to the allegation in a recent statement announcing its new CEO and president Alexis McGill Johnson, saying that it has publicly committed to reckoning with its history, investing in work aimed at engaging communities of color, and improving Planned Parenthoods health care delivery. Much of the controversy stems from a 1939 letter Sanger wrote about her effort to open clinics in the rural south, which she called The Negro Project. Sanger recruited Black leaders to support the project and, in the letter, she said that white men should not run the clinics and that there would be more community involvement and support if the clinics were run by Black doctors because they could get closer to their members and more or less lay their cards on the table which means their superstitions, ignorance, and doubts. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members, she wrote. The first half of the sentence was referenced in a letter Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas and 25 House Republicans sent in 2015 urging the National Portrait Gallery to remove a bust of Sanger to support their claim that she famously espoused birth control as a method for controlling the population of minorities. Historians have argued that the line has been taken out of context and that she was referring to peoples suspicions, not Planned Parenthoods goal. key background Anti-abortion activists also point to the fact that Stanger, who is seen as the founder of the birth control movement, spoke about birth control at a womens branch of the Klu Klux Klan in 1926. Planned Parenthood has since denounced the meeting with the Klu Klux Klan, saying that it strongly disagrees with Sangers decision to address an organization that spreads hatred. They also argue that, while Sanger believed in the broader issues of health and fitness that concerned the early 20th-century eugenics movement, she believed that reproductive decisions should be made by individuals and that she consistently and firmly repudiated any strictly racial application of eugenics principles. She did believe in some of the eugenics principles progressives of the day favored that many would balk at today, including Planned Parenthood, which has said there are major flaws in Sangers views and called them wrong. ""That Sanger was enamored and supported some eugenicists' ideas is certainly true,"" Susan Reverby, a health care historian and professor at Wellesley College, told NPR in a 2015 article about the allegations. But, she added, Sanger's main argument was not eugenics it was that ""Sanger thought people should have the children they wanted."" crucial quote The sentence may have been thoughtlessly composed, but it is perfectly clear that she was not endorsing genocide, Ellen Chesler, author of Woman of Valor Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America, wrote in a 2011 Salon article. chief critic Any insinuation that abortion is Black genocide is offensive and infantlizing, Planned Parenthoods Director of Black Leadership and Engagement Nia Martin-Robinson told Forbes in an emailed statement. At Planned Parenthood, we trust and we stand with Black women who have, and continue to lead the charge when it comes to the health, rights and bodily autonomy of those in their communities. tangent Wests famous wife Kim Kardashian West, has been supportive of Planned Parenthood. In an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, she and her sisters Khloe and Kourtney went to a Planned Parenthood center to talk to women. ""The perception of Planned Parenthood is that it's like this abortion clinic,"" Kardashian West said during the episode. ""That's nothing like what it's like. Hearing that first-hand really made it real for me."" West made his view of abortion clear in the four-hour Forbes interview saying, ""I am pro-life because I'm following the word of the bible.

Elana Lyn GrossEditorial StandardsPrintReprints Permissions","In a 2020 interview with Forbes, Kanye West shared controversial views about Planned Parenthood, claiming it was set up by white supremacists to perform “the Devil’s work.” He suggested that the organization’s founder, Margaret Sanger, had racist motives, referencing anti-abortion activists’ claims about her association with eugenics. Specifically, West pointed to a 1939 letter by Sanger that discussed her “Negro Project,” aimed at providing birth control to Black communities, and her controversial involvement with the Klan. However, Planned Parenthood has consistently refuted these claims, stating that Sanger’s work was misunderstood and that the organization is committed to supporting communities of color.

Sanger’s belief in eugenics, though widely criticized today, was not aimed at racial extermination but was centered on health and fitness concerns, according to historians. Planned Parenthood acknowledges her support of some eugenic ideas, but it maintains that she always advocated for individual reproductive rights. West, who has been vocal about his “pro-life” stance based on his Christian beliefs, criticized abortion, aligning himself with anti-abortion sentiments. His wife, Kim Kardashian West, however, has publicly supported Planned Parenthood, emphasizing its role in providing more than just abortion services.

The debate over Sanger’s legacy continues to spark controversy, with some alleging that abortion disproportionately affects Black communities, a view that Planned Parenthood rejects, asserting that such claims are offensive and misleading."
Do Michigan Republicans running for Congress back Graham‚Äôs 15-week abortion ban? ‚Ä¢ Michigan Advance,"In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a bill proposing a nationwide 15-week abortion ban. While many red states have stricter bans, this bill would override laws in states that do not. Michigan, where voters will decide on Proposal 3 to enshrine reproductive rights in the state Constitution, currently has a 1931 abortion ban blocked by the courts.

As Michigan’s congressional races are pivotal in determining control of the U.S. House, the positions of GOP candidates on abortion are under scrutiny. The Democratic candidates in Michigan’s four key districts all support abortion rights and have criticized the Supreme Court’s decision. On the other hand, the Republican candidates, including John Gibbs (3rd District), Tom Barrett (7th District), Paul Junge (8th District), and John James (10th District), oppose abortion rights and have been endorsed by the state’s anti-abortion group, Right to Life of Michigan.

None of the Michigan GOP candidates responded to queries about their stance on Graham’s bill. However, some Republican senators, like Mitch McConnell and Roy Blunt, have expressed a preference for leaving abortion policy decisions to individual states.

Key points from individual candidates:
	•	John Gibbs (3rd District): Opposes abortion, framing it as a moral issue and supports protecting unborn lives.
	•	Tom Barrett (7th District): Initially expressed staunch anti-abortion views, but removed these references from his campaign site after Kansas voters rejected an abortion ban. He supports anti-abortion policies but has distanced himself from the 15-week national ban.
	•	Paul Junge (8th District): Strongly supports the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and aligns with the pro-life stance.
	•	John James (10th District): Previously compared abortion to genocide, advocating for pro-life policies.

In contrast, the Democratic candidates, such as Hillary Scholten, Elissa Slotkin, Dan Kildee, and Carl Marlinga, all support abortion rights and are endorsed by Planned Parenthood. They oppose the Supreme Court’s ruling and would work to secure abortion protections at the federal level.

In summary, Michigan’s Republican candidates oppose abortion rights, with some hesitant to commit fully to Graham’s 15-week federal ban, while the Democratic candidates are firm in B106their support for reproductive rights.","In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v.

UNFPA's Global Response Plan to COVID-19 focuses on 3 strategic priorities 1. The continuity of sexual and reproductive health SRH services and interventions, including the protection of health personnel. 2. Addressing gender-based violence. 3. Ensuring the supply of modern contraceptives and reproductive health supplies. Transfer of kits from the UNFPA Peru Office One of the lines of action proposed to contribute to the continuity of SRH services is the delivery of different types of kits the SRH Kits, aimed at health facilities, with medicines and medical instruments to directly support sexual and reproductive health care, and the Hygiene Kits, also called Dignity Kits, with self-care and personal hygiene supplies for adolescents and women who have been affected by the health crisis and find themselves in conditions of difficult access to water or other fundamental resources. Each Hygiene Kit contains soap, shampoo, sanitary towels, cotton underwear, toothpaste, toothbrush, comb, alcohol gel, deodorant stick and toilet paper all inside a reusable fabric bag. It also contains basic information on sexual and reproductive health care and gender-based violence services. The content of this kit has a direct impact on the dignity and empowerment of adolescent girls and women, because it promotes their opportunity to participate in economic and community activities, family functioning, autonomy and mobility, and consequently their access to resources and services. In the year 2020, in close coordination with the Ministry of Health, 3,000 hygiene kits will be distributed in Tumbes, Piura, Chiclayo and San Juan de Lurigancho. These kits will be given to migrant adolescents and women, refugees and host communities, users of sexual and reproductive health services who are in greatest need. First delivery San Juan de Lurigancho Postpartum woman in San Juan de Lurigancho Hospital HSJL San Juan de Lurigancho, with more than one million inhabitants, is one of the most populated districts in Latin America and one of the localities that most felt the advance of the COVID-19 among its inhabitants. In the last six months, the district hospital has had countless difficulties, as well as the entire health system, in responding to citizen demands for all kinds of services during the pandemic, including sexual and reproductive health services. It is in this emergency context that the United Nations Population Fund in Peru took steps to join the humanitarian response strategy, with an emphasis on women in a vulnerable situation. Supporting with the delivery of 495 dignity kits, distributed among the main hospital and other health centers in the jurisdiction, marks the direction in which UNFPA has aimed during the entire COVID-19 health emergency to help ensure that no one is left behind. In this delivery, made on November 5, the Assistant Representative of the United Nations Population Fund in Peru, Mara Eugenia Mujica, went to the San Juan de Lurigancho Hospital HSJL to accompany the transfer of supplies that took place with the presence of the Director of the Pablo Samuel Crdova Ticse Hospital and representatives of the Directorate of Integrated Health Networks DIRIS Lima Center, an institution attached to the Ministry of Health.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNFPA’s Global Response Plan prioritizes three key actions: maintaining sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, addressing gender-based violence, and ensuring the supply of modern contraceptives and health supplies.

To support SRH continuity, UNFPA has implemented the distribution of self-care kits, including SRH kits for health facilities and hygiene kits (also called Dignity Kits) for vulnerable women and adolescents. These kits contain personal hygiene products such as soap, shampoo, sanitary towels, cotton underwear, toothpaste, deodorant, and toilet paper, all packed in a reusable fabric bag. They also include basic information on SRH care and gender-based violence services. These kits help promote the dignity, autonomy, and empowerment of women and adolescents by enabling their participation in economic and social activities, enhancing their mobility, and improving their access to essential resources and services.

In 2020, UNFPA, in collaboration with Peru’s Ministry of Health, distributed 3,000 hygiene kits in areas including Tumbes, Piura, Chiclayo, and San Juan de Lurigancho, targeting migrant and refugee women and adolescents, as well as local communities with limited access to resources. One notable distribution occurred on November 5, when 495 dignity kits were delivered to the San Juan de Lurigancho Hospital and other health centers in the area, which faced significant challenges during the pandemic. This initiative highlights UNFPA’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that no one is left behind during the COVID-19 health crisis."

Sayuri Fujita, a Japanese-born television star, seemed aware of this as she posted a joyful photo of herself and her newborn on social media, writing, Becoming a single mother was not an easy decision, but it is also not a shameful decision. I want to thank my son for making me a proud mother. Giving birth outside of marriage is often stigmatized due to the countrys Confucian culture and patriarchal family structures in which women are seen as less valued. An estimated 20,761 single-parent households are headed by unmarried mothers in South Korea. The actual number may be significantly higher, as stigma leads some to conceal their unmarried status. Lack of social acceptance for unwed mothers and their children means they are more likely to be living in poverty and be socially isolated. Although South Koreas birth rate is among the lowest in the world, and the government is concerned about the countrys aging population, artificial insemination and IVF treatments are not an option for unmarried women. Sperm banks set their own criteria for accepting patients and will not provide services to unmarried women. But public attitudes towards single parenthood are changing a recent survey found 31 percent of South Koreans accept having children without getting married. South Korean women and girls have long faced violations of their reproductive rights as the government pursued policies seeking at different times to reduce and then increase the birth rate. Stigma against unmarried mothersand severe restrictions on abortion--helped drive high rates of international adoption from South Korea. Women have long fought for access to abortion, and the countrys Constitutional Court recently ordered the government to reverse its abortion ban. It is high time for South Korea to fully respect reproductive rights. The government should eliminate barriers to accessing abortion and make assisted reproductive services available for everyone, no matter their marital status, sexual orientation, or family configuration. It should also act to eradicate all forms of discrimination and stigma against single parents, particularly unwed mothers. Everyone has a right to decide for themselves if they want a family or not.

The issue gained attention after television star Sayuri Fujita gave birth to a child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Japan. Her decision to become a single mother sparked a debate in South Korea, where giving birth outside of marriage is stigmatized due to deeply rooted Confucian and patriarchal norms.

In South Korea, unmarried mothers face significant social ostracism, which leads to higher rates of poverty and isolation for both the mothers and their children. The country has one of the lowest birth rates globally, yet unmarried women are often denied access to artificial insemination and IVF services, as sperm banks refuse to treat single women. Despite this, public opinion is slowly shifting, with a recent survey showing that 31% of South Koreans now support having children outside of marriage.

The article also addresses the broader history of reproductive rights in South Korea, including the restriction of abortion, which had been part of government policies to control the population. In a recent victory for women’s rights, the Constitutional Court ruled to reverse the country’s abortion ban. Human Rights Watch calls on the South Korean government to eliminate barriers to abortion, make assisted reproductive technologies accessible to all women regardless of marital status or sexual orientation, and end discrimination against single parents. The right to decide whether to have a family should be respected for everyone, regardless of societal pressures."

The law, passed in October 2020 but delayed due to mass protests, prohibits abortion in most cases, including for fetuses with congenital defects. The law allows abortions only when a woman’s health is at risk or in cases of rape or incest.

The ruling has sparked widespread backlash, particularly from women’s rights groups and opposition parties. Thousands of demonstrators, many from the Women’s Strike movement, took to the streets in Warsaw and other cities to express their anger. These protests follow months of prior demonstrations, some of which turned violent, with tensions running high amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

Poland already had some of the strictest abortion laws in the EU, and this ruling further tightens restrictions. Critics argue that it significantly limits women’s rights, with estimates suggesting 200,000 abortions are performed illegally or abroad each year. The ruling is seen by some as a move by the right-wing government to consolidate its power, particularly in light of its controversial reforms to the judiciary. The protests reflect broader dissatisfaction with the government’s policies and its erosion of democratic principles."

Pro-life crisis pregnancy centers have endured vandalism and attacks at the hands of ravenous protesters angered by the overturn of Roe v. Wade and the events leading up to it. These centers have been villainized by Democrats, but mothers who've been helped by them say nothing could be further from the truth.Two crisis pregnancy centers in and around the nations capital, the Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center in Washington, D.C., and Life First in Manassas, Virginia, opened their doors to Fox News Digital to share how they are helping women and families in the nascent stages of building their lives. PRO-CHOICE PROTESTERS DISRUPT CAPITOL HILL CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS BANQUET SCREAMING BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS Video ""My experience happened over a decade ago, so my oldest now is 11, so when I was pregnant, I came through Life First formerly known as CareNet back then,"" Alana Jenkins, a mother helped by Life First said. Jenkins, a mother of five including her youngest, Rip, said she considered abortion when she was unexpectedly pregnant with her first but chose to keep her child after visiting with Life First.""It was scary, you know, I wasnt quite sure what I was expecting other than they offered free services I wanted to take advantage of,"" Jenkins said. ""I had already decided of having an abortion, but my husband and I decided that we wanted to get more information and a sonogram at the time to confirm I was pregnant."" Video Jenkins said she ""was greeted with nothing but love"" from the staff at Life First and that it was ""amazing"" to see where her experience at the center ""led to.""""It was great to feel that comfort and love through professionalism, guiding me through the steps,"" Jenkins said. ""Not what I wanted to hear, but the education of what having a baby was all about, the steps, the process."" Donation items provided by Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center. Fox News Digital ""They offered support, which was huge for me for making my final decision, because I was scared, financially, we were not in a position for bringing on a child,"" she continued. ""But, again, with their professionalism and their support and what they offered, it was amazing."" Jenkins said her pregnancy was confirmed by the center with a sonogram and that her time at the center led to a ""step-by-step process"" to help her and her budding family with what they needed.Ten years and five kids later, Jenkins and her husband have made their home in Vint Hill, Virginia, where they own a CrossFit gym.Jenkins said she fell out of contact with Life First after her first experience with them, but reconnected with the clinic after Life First CEO Becky Sheetz visited her gym promoting a church ""sit-up"" challenge fundraiser and shared her experience with the center. Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center executive director Janet Durig spoke with Fox News Digital about the work they do helping mothers facing crisis pregnancies and are considering abortion. The center was hit with vandalism following the Roe v. Wade opinion draft leak and their annual banquet was interrupted by protesters shouting ""blood on your hands."" Fox News Digital ""Anytime they need help, anything I can do of service, like here just explaining my experience and what the result of their assistance has done for my kids, my life, hopefully now for others,"" Jenkins said.Niya, a mother helped by Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center, initially visited to find out if she was pregnant. After confirming she was pregnant, the center gave her counseling and resources.Niya was considering abortion at first, as she felt she ""wasnt ready"" to be a mother, but knew she had to ""get ready"" and decided to keep her baby, Amara, after visiting with Maloney. The team at Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center explained all the options for her baby that Niya could choose, such as raising the child or placing the child up for adoption, instead of going through an abortion. ""After that, I left, Jamie gave me a few pamphlets about adoption, giving your child to somebody else, a family that might want them,"" Niya said. ""And she was emailing me and stuff, checking on me. She sent me a gift for my baby, I told her I was going to keep it, and shes just been in contact with me since.""

Fox News DigitalBoth centers help new parents get on their feet through counseling and professional placement help, ensuring that the budding families have a steady source of income. Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center, while not currently providing medical procedures such as ultrasounds, provides faith-based counseling to expectant mothers who may be considering abortion.The center was hit with vandalism in the wake of the Supreme Court leak of the opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. They were hit with red paint, eggs, and graffiti reading ""Jane Says Revenge."" Janet Durig, executive director of Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center, told Fox News Digital the centers staff felt ""violated"" by the vandalism and it ""comes back to people misunderstanding what pregnancy centers like ours do, or they really understand it and think its awful to help people."" Free baby formula provided by Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center. Fox News Digital Capitol Hill Pregnancy Centers annual banquet was interrupted by protesters who disrupted Durig while she was speaking on the work the center performs. The protest led to the center upping their security presence.Durig said she was called by the Department of Homeland Security DHS, who told her that the protesting group, ShutdownDC, had been chattering about the banquet protest on social media. The protesters inside the banquet had sat at the table with one mother, Niya, and her child as well as the centers director of client and volunteer services, Jamie Maloney and dug into the meal provided to attendees before interrupting the event. ""They ate our meal, they ate our hors dvours, they ate our meal, and even commented on how good it was from other people Ive been told and so did the other protesters, by the way,"" Durig said in regards to the protesters. Life First-provided counseling room for mothers in crisis pregnancies. Fox News Digital""And then sat right next to Niya, the mother testimony-giver and her baby, and seemed to feel comfortable standing up and protesting the center,"" Durig added.Durig said the protest was mostly a lot of yelling, but nobody could ""explain"" to her how they have ""blood"" on their hands when they are ""helping people who choose to give birth to their baby."" ""They want to have their baby, we dont force that on anyone, and we dont force that choice on anyone,"" Durig said. ""Where is the blood on our hands because that woman has chosen to keep her baby?"" Durig also noted that mothers coming to the clinic were ""disconcerted"" by the protests but they ""all felt everything was under control"" when handling the protest at the banquet.She also said she believes that the protesters misunderstand what the center and others like it provide to families, such as job counseling.

""Jane says revenge motherf---er,"" she added.Niya said she had clocked the protesters when she showed up to the banquet but was unaware that three of the protesters were sitting next to her during the event.""They were talking, I was talking, saying how I felt about the people outside and stuff like that, and they were listening. I think one of them did have something they really wanted to say, but she didnt say anything,"" Niya said about the protesters. ""And then they just start standing up and yelling.""Niya said she was ""confused"" by the protesters at first and that the protesters had been complimenting her childs cuteness before interrupting the banquet. ""Like, I understood what they were saying, but at the same time, thats not how you go about stuff,"" Niya said. ""I just felt like everybody got a mind of their own, I went to a pregnancy center and didnt have a problem with it."" The mothers, however, say other women in similar situations to them should explore their options at crisis pregnancy centers.""Dont be scared! Like, dont be scared,"" Niya said, encouraging other women in similar situations to visit crisis pregnancy clinics. ""I just feel like we all have a responsibility, whether youre pro-choice or not. And thats something you want to do, you have to stand up for what you believe in and do it.""""Nobody changed my mind on anything like that,"" she continued.

Market data provided by","Crisis pregnancy centers, such as Life First in Manassas, Virginia, and Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center in Washington, D.C., have provided significant support to women facing unplanned pregnancies, helping many avoid abortion. These centers offer a range of services, including counseling, sonograms, material support like baby formula and clothing, and referrals for prenatal care and job placement. Two mothers shared their transformative experiences with these centers, emphasizing the nonjudgmental, compassionate care they received during moments of crisis.

Alana Jenkins, a mother of five, recalled considering abortion when unexpectedly pregnant, but chose to keep her child after visiting Life First. She appreciated the free sonogram, professional guidance, and emotional support, which helped her overcome fears about finances and readiness. A decade later, Jenkins remains grateful for the center’s role in her decision, and has since reconnected with them through community events.

Another mother, Niya, was also initially considering abortion when she visited Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center. However, after receiving counseling and learning about alternatives like adoption, she decided to keep her baby. Niya appreciated the ongoing support she received from the center, including follow-up emails, a baby gift, and a nonjudgmental space to discuss her choices.

Despite their positive impact, these centers have been targeted by pro-abortion protesters, especially following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center experienced vandalism, including red paint and graffiti, and their annual banquet was interrupted by protesters who accused the center of having “blood on their hands.” These actions, however, only reinforced the centers’ belief in the value of their work. Both centers remain committed to offering support without pushing any particular decision, focusing instead on providing information and resources.

The centers aim to empower women by offering a range of services, including prenatal education, job counseling, and access to community resources. They emphasize that their goal is to help women make informed decisions without pressure. Several centers also collaborate with local organizations to provide housing, food, clothing, and other essentials. Through these efforts, the centers aim to give mothers facing crisis pregnancies the tools they need to choose life and build a stable future for themselves and their children.

The mothers featured in the article encouraged others in similar situations to explore their options at crisis pregnancy centers, sharing their belief that these centers offer a safe, supportive environment for making important decisions. Jenkins described her experience as a “huge enlightenment” that changed her perspective on success and family, urging women to seek education and support before making decisions about abortion."
"Anti-abortion groups mobilize to provide pregnancy, parenting support","Anti-abortion groups mobilize to provide pregnancy, parenting supportAkron Zoo worker recovering from injuries after being bitten by Komodo dragonNews Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals LOCALLife after Roe Anti-abortion groups mobilize to provide pregnancy and parenting supportShannon CoanAkron Beacon JournalTwo days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the Rev. Norman K. Douglas, like many other religious leaders, spoke about abortion from his pulpit at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Parish in Akron.He read a statement from Bishop Edward Malesic of the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, which applauded the ruling and listed resources for new and expecting parents. Douglas then added his own message about the need to advocate for policies like universal health care, paid parental leave and the continuation of enhanced child tax credits.The key from our point of view, too, is we got to make sure that were not only concerned about a baby being born, but were concerned about the family and were concerned about the help that people get after the babys born, Douglas told the Beacon Journal. If were going to show were pro-life through everything, we need to encourage our people to vote in these ways.As those who oppose abortion embrace and celebrate a post-Roe future, many say they also are working to provide services to individuals experiencing unplanned pregnancies who can no longer obtain an abortion legally in Ohio. Roughly 20,600 abortions were performed in Ohio in 2020, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health.MoreAkron celebrates, mourns the end of constitutional right to abortionHours after the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, Ohio reinstated its so-called heartbeat law, which outlaws abortion after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, typically around six weeks of gestation, except when the mothers life is at risk. At that point, many don't yet realize they are pregnant.A defining momentMary von Carlowitz, who directs the Diocese of Clevelands Office for Human Life, said now is a defining moment for the Catholic Church, which has long opposed abortion.Weve talked about supporting pro-life, being pro-life and walking with all moms in need, but this is a time where we have to really show them that were going to do what we said we would all along, she said.When an individual seeking help calls or walks through the doors of St. Vincents, Douglas or another member of the pastoral team first sit down with the person and listen to their story.Were not so much providing all the resources. Were listening. Were letting them know theyre cared about, he said. Its not just, Hey, heres a list of resources. Heres a piece of paper. Go to them. No, its spending time with the person and then letting them know the resources available.Other anti-abortion groups also serve a link to available resources for expectant parents, even though they don't provide those services themselves.When a pregnant person seeking help calls Right to Life of Northeast Ohio, Allie Frazier, the organizations executive director, immediately connects them with a resource in the community, often a pregnancy resource center.Fraziers organization does not provide services because it's focused on advocacy, but she said Right to Life has personal relationships with many of the resources in what she describes as the holistic safety net. Beyond the pregnancy centers, the safety net includes organizations like LoveLine, a national organization that provides financial assistance to pregnant and single mothers.In this post-Roe environment, theres a lot of concern that women arent going to be getting the supplies they need, Frazier said. That is absolutely not going to happen. The pro-life movement is 100 committed to meeting these needs.MoreTheir pregnancies fall just outside Ohios new six week abortion ban. What do they do now?But Kellie Copeland, who leads Pro Choice Ohio and is based in Akron, questions whether these needs will actually be met.I want you to know whos responsible for this Its Gov. Mike DeWine, its Dave Yost, its the anti-choice organizations in this state and its the Republican Party, none of which have lifted a finger to make being pregnant in this state easier, Copeland said.We dont even have a minimum unpaid maternity leave, and these politicians and organizations have the unmitigated gall to say now, somehow, theyre going to be here for people, she said. Where the hell have they been? Where? What took them so long? If this was about supporting pregnant people and about babies, they wouldve done something.Ohio ranked 31st in child well-being in 2021, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundations Kids Count report.We are going to just continue as we did beforeNone of the organizations the Beacon Journal talked to said they had started or planned to start a new initiative after the Supreme Courts ruling. They varied on whether they were increasing existing services.Both Akron Pregnancy Services and Embrace Clinic and Care Center in Barberton insist that nothing changes in their operations now that Roe has been overturned.Pre-Roe and post-Roe, theres going to be women that are facing unplanned pregnancies and maybe have a hard time getting the support that they need or the material goods that they need, said Peggy Swyrydenko, Embrace Clinic and Care Centers executive director. ""We are going to just continue as we did before.Swyrydenko said that the centers staff did not make an official plan to alter or increase services before the Supreme Courts ruling because they knew that people would still be facing unplanned pregnancies. For now, she said, theyre prepared for a potential increase in people seeking services.Were well staffed and well-funded, and we have a lot of supplies already on hand, Swyrydenko said. We havent had anything that were running out of that people are looking for.The two centers each provide free diapers, infant and toddler clothing, wipes, baby food, formula and parenting classes. The Barberton clinic also offers pregnancy testing, birth control and ultrasound services.At the Akron center, parents can earn vouchers for larger items by attending parenting classes or viewing parenting videos. Attendance at five classes, for instance, is enough to earn a Pack N Play, a type of portable crib and playpen.For services the Barberton clinic does not provide, such as housing and food assistance, the center typically refers individuals to other organizations, Swyrydenko said. Those include state- and county-run resources like WIC the special supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants and Children and the Akron Metropolitan Housing Authority.In 2021, the state budget set aside 6 million for the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which funds several crisis pregnancy centers throughout the state. Centers that receive funds through the program are not allowed to be involved in or associated with any abortion activities, which includes providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics. Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order earlier this year that gave another 1.7 million to the program.MoreNew budget earmarks 7.5 million of Ohio taxpayers' money for pregnancy centersFrazier said her organization regularly provides supplies to local pregnancy centers that come from the baby supplies drive at Right to Life of Northeast Ohios annual banquet and donations left at the organizations office. They also sometimes buy specific items that are in short supply at a pregnancy center.She expects those efforts to increase as the pregnancy centers needs grow.They are the ones who are boots on the ground and bring real support to women in crisis, Frazier said. Going forward, the pro-life movement is just unshakingly focused on providing the best possible support for them.There shouldnt be anyone that feels unaccompanied Although a couple of local Catholic parishes directly offer resources for new and expecting parents, most refer parents to pregnancy centers and services run by the Cleveland Diocese or affiliated with it.Currently, the diocese is continuing a push started a year ago to expand its parish-run efforts, largely through the Walking with Moms in Need initiative. The nationwide program was initially launched by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and works at a parish level to pair congregants with local mothers facing difficult pregnancies.Von Carlowitz called the initiative a focal point for the Cleveland Diocese. About 20 of the 185 parishes in the diocese have begun putting the initiative into effect and another 20 are looking into the initiative, she said.Walking with Moms in Need is just to have a very personal touch so that a woman, especially in an emergent pregnancy situation, that feels alone or scared or, you know, finding out that she can no longer obtain an abortion legally in the state of Ohio knows that shes not going to be alone, von Carlowitz said.Beyond providing basic supplies to new and expecting parents, the program also intends to help parents meet all of their needs, whether that involves day care, housing, education or job training, according to von Carlowitz. The goal, she said, is for each parish to have the structure to provide support themselves and the resources needed to connect parents with local organizations that can provide services outside the parishs scope.Everyone in the parish community should know where to refer a pregnant woman in need, von Carlowitz said. We want people to know that were here to accompany them. Like I said, not only through pregnancy but through parenting as well.St. Vincents in Akron aims to formalize its Walking with Moms in Need initiative by the beginning of August, Douglas said.The Cleveland Dioceses Catholic Charities organization also operates one of the many Help Me Grow programs in Ohio. Help Me Grow is a state-run home visiting program that provides education on infant growth, development and parenting skills.Beyond providing education, home visitors help connect families enrolled in Help Me Grow with all of the other services provided by Catholic Charities. In Summit County, those include providing grocery gift cards, bus passes, baby supplies and emergency financial assistance for rent and utilities, according to Julie Neely, one of Catholic Charities program administrators for Help Me Grow.For the next year, the organization also has access to a safety grant that allows them to provide items like child proofing supplies, car seats and high chairs, Neely said.We are really there just to be a partner with families to help them, you know, parent the way they want to parent, she said. Were not there, you know, to judge or to lecture. Were just going to support them in the best way that we can and in the manner they need us to.Those who oppose abortion remain excited and hopeful for the future.Theres a saying in the pro-life movement, Love them both, and I think that a lot of times people think that thats just like a platitude, and its really not, Frazier said. It is a pledge that we are going to take care of women, and we are going to do what it takes to provide for these babies, and honestly, we are ready for the challenge. We cannot wait for what comes next.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing Reprints Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper NIE ArchivesAkron Classifieds Kent Classifieds Jobs Cars Homes Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions 2024 All rights reserved.","In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion groups, particularly in Ohio, are mobilizing to provide support for pregnant individuals, especially those unable to access abortion services due to state restrictions. The state’s heartbeat law, which bans abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected (around six weeks), has sparked a renewed effort among pro-life organizations to assist people with unplanned pregnancies.

Religious leaders, like the Rev. Norman K. Douglas of St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Parish in Akron, are emphasizing the importance of supporting both the unborn and their families through resources such as universal healthcare, paid parental leave, and child tax credits. They advocate not just for the baby’s birth, but for long-term family support. The Catholic Diocese of Cleveland has intensified its commitment to this by expanding its “Walking with Moms in Need” initiative, which helps parishioners connect with local resources for expecting parents, ranging from financial aid to parenting education.

Organizations such as Akron Pregnancy Services and Embrace Clinic and Care Center continue to provide essential services, including baby supplies, parenting classes, and pregnancy testing, without altering their operations post-Roe. However, some centers are prepared for a potential increase in demand due to more women facing unplanned pregnancies. They partner with local resources to offer additional support like housing, food, and healthcare assistance.

Right to Life of Northeast Ohio is also playing a significant role by connecting individuals with community resources, though it focuses on advocacy rather than direct service provision. The organization emphasizes that the pro-life movement remains dedicated to meeting the needs of pregnant individuals, with increased efforts expected in the coming months.

Despite these initiatives, critics like Kellie Copeland from Pro Choice Ohio argue that the pro-life movement has failed to address systemic issues such as lack of paid maternity leave, insufficient childcare, and overall poor child well-being in the state. Ohio ranks 31st in child well-being, prompting skepticism from those who question the sincerity of pro-life advocates’ commitment to supporting families.

While many organizations insist they will continue providing services as before, the shift in Ohio’s legal landscape has intensified efforts to ensure no woman facing an unplanned pregnancy feels unsupported. Ultimately, the goal is to provide both immediate assistance and long-term support, fostering a sense of community and care for those in need."

Heres what this one does. Obtaining an abortion in Oklahoma is about to become all but impossible. By Nicole Nareanicolenarea Apr 29, 2022, 250pm EDT Share this story Share this on Facebook Share this on Twitter Share this on Reddit Share All sharing options All sharing options for Reddit Pocket Flipboard Email Abortion rights advocates gather outside the Oklahoma Capitol in Oklahoma City on April 5 to protest several anti-abortion bills being considered by the GOP-led legislature. Sean MurphyAP Nicole Narea covers politics and society for Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic. Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma passed a bill on Thursday that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, typically around six weeks into pregnancy and before many even know they are pregnant. The Oklahoma Heartbeat Act will take immediate effect as soon as Gov. Kevin Stitt signs the bill, which is expected as early as Friday. Stitt has committed to signing any anti-abortion legislation that comes across his desk and has previously described himself as Americas most pro-life governor. Earlier this month, Oklahoma enacted a different bill that nearly totally bans abortion except in cases where the pregnant persons life is endangered. Under that bill, anyone who performs an abortion would face up to 10 years in prison and up to 100,000 in fines. It will take effect in August unless barred by the courts. The new bill, which was passed without debate or any questions allowed, is modeled after a Texas law that went into effect last year. It has exceptions for cases where the pregnant persons life is endangered, but not for cases of rape, incest, or fetal conditions that make life unsustainable after birth. It also imposes additional reporting requirements on physicians and allows private individuals to seek civil penalties, including at least 10,000 in damages, against anyone who aids in or performs an abortion after the six-week term. Thats designed to circumvent current legal limitations on the governments ability to go after abortion providers. Its identical to the bill that was enacted by the Texas Legislature last year, and that bill has passed muster with the United States Supreme Court, Tony Lauinger, the chairman of Oklahomans for Life, told the AP. The Supreme Court, however, never held a full hearing on the bill and merely dismissed a case challenging the bill in a brief order without explaining its reasoning. We are hopeful that this bill will save the lives of more unborn children here in Oklahoma as well, Lauinger added. Abortion advocates challenged the bill in the Oklahoma Supreme Court late Thursday, arguing that it prevents Oklahomans from accessing constitutionally protected abortion care. For those able to scrape together the necessary funds, the bill will force them to travel out of state to access abortion care. Others will attempt to self-manage their own abortions without medical supervision. And many Oklahomans will have no choice but to continue their pregnancies against their will, they write in the lawsuit. Its the latest in a series of anti-abortion laws passed in Oklahoma and in several other GOP-controlled state legislatures that make it all but impossible to obtain an in-state physical abortion, even while the US Supreme Courts precedent in its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade still stands. The court will decide a case by early July in which it is expected to partially or completely overturn Roe, which recognized a pregnant persons fundamental right to seek an abortion, but found that states could still impose restrictions on the procedure in the service of protecting the pregnant persons health and the potential life of a fetus once it can survive outside the womb. But even if the court doesnt overturn Roe, the latest Oklahoma bill will likely still stand given that legal challenges to the parallel law in Texas have failed. Many Texans have flocked to Oklahoma abortion clinics after their states heartbeat act went into effect in September. There are just four such facilities across the entire state of Oklahoma, which have seen soaring demand in the months since. Trust Women which operates a clinic in Oklahoma City that provides medication and surgical abortions up to the current legal limit of 21.6 weeks says it has seen a 2,500 percent increase in patients. Even though the clinic has doubled the number of days of the week that its open from two to four, patients still may have to wait two to four weeks for an abortion, sometimes forcing them to travel to other states if that puts them over the time period within which its legal to have an abortion in Oklahoma. The passage of the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act will make it even harder to meet that demand. Planned Parenthood Great Plains providers have served thousands of Texans in the past seven months because of their states harsh bounty-hunting scheme, and we have been proud to stand with them and provide essential, constitutionally protected abortion services, Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. Now, rather than serving as a haven for patients unable to get care at home, Oklahoma politicians have made outcasts of their own people. Will you help keep Vox free for all?

All Rights Reserved","Oklahoma recently passed the “Heartbeat Act,” a law that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around six weeks, often before a person even realizes they are pregnant. This bill, which mirrors a similar law passed in Texas, will take effect once signed by Governor Kevin Stitt, who has shown strong support for anti-abortion measures. The law has some exceptions for cases where the life of the pregnant person is in danger but excludes exceptions for rape, incest, or fatal fetal conditions.

The law also allows private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who performs or aids in an abortion, with penalties starting at $10,000. This is designed to circumvent legal barriers to government enforcement by shifting the responsibility to individuals. The law’s passage follows a broader pattern of anti-abortion legislation in Oklahoma, which recently passed another law that bans nearly all abortions except when the person’s life is at risk.

Abortion rights advocates have already challenged the law in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, arguing that it violates the constitutional right to access abortion services. The law significantly limits access to abortion in-state, leading some individuals to seek care in neighboring states. This is particularly concerning as the number of abortion providers in Oklahoma is small, and demand has surged after Texas implemented a similar law.

The Oklahoma Heartbeat Act represents an ongoing legal battle over abortion rights in the United States, especially as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on the future of Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion. Despite legal challenges, the Oklahoma law is likely to remain in effect due to precedents set by Texas’ law."

Gov. Kim Reynolds signs a 6-week 'fetal heartbeat' abortion ban during the Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines, Friday, July 14, 2023. Zach Boyden-HolmesThe RegisterUSA Today Network CNN Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill into law Friday that bans most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy. This week, in a rare and historic special session, the Iowa legislature voted for a second time to reject the inhumanity of abortion and pass the fetal heartbeat law, she said in remarks ahead of signing the bill at the Family Leadership Summit. The law, which is effective immediately, comes after Reynolds ordered a special legislative session last week with the sole purpose of restricting the procedure in the state. But it is already facing a legal challenge after a group of abortion providers in the state filed a suit to try and stop the law. The bill, which passed the states Republican-controlled legislature earlier this week, prohibits physicians from providing most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. It includes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infants death. It also includes exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days. Protestors fill the Iowa State Capitol rotunda, as the Iowa Legislature convenes for special session to pass 6-week 'fetal heartbeat' abortion ban Tuesday, July 11, 2023. Zach Boyden-HolmesThe Des Moines RegisterAP While the bill language makes clear it is not to be construed to impose civil or criminal liability on a woman upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the division, guidelines on how physicians would be punished for violating the law are left up to Iowas board of medicine to decide leaving the potential for some vagueness in how the law ought to be enforced in the interim. Iowa joins a growing list of Republican-led states that have championed sweeping abortion restrictions in the wake of last years Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Reynolds push for abortion restrictions in the state comes weeks after Iowas Supreme Court declined to lift a block on the states 2018 six-week abortion ban, deadlocking in a 3-3 vote whether to overturn a lower court decision that deemed the law unconstitutional. The Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer, Reynolds said Tuesday in a statement following the bills passage. The voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed. Abortion rights supporters have been speaking out against the abortion ban in the state. National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison called the ban the latest show of abortion extremism from MAGA Republicans. Governor Kim Reynolds just signed a cruel abortion ban into law among a crowd of extremists who cheered as Iowan womens abortion rights were stripped away, Harrison said in a statement Friday. Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups, including National Right to Life and Iowa Right to Life, praised Reynolds and the laws supporters in the state legislature for the abortion ban. We will continue to advocate for life and will not stop fighting until abortion becomes unthinkable, Kristi Judkins, executive director of Iowa Right to Life said in a statement. We want to see lives saved and women no longer placed in harms way because of abortion. This story has been updated with additional information.

This move followed a special legislative session where the Republican-controlled Iowa legislature passed the bill. The law includes exceptions for cases of miscarriage, threats to the pregnant woman’s life, and fatal fetal abnormalities. Abortions resulting from rape or incest are allowed if reported within certain timeframes—45 days for rape and 140 days for incest.

The law, which is effective immediately, has sparked legal challenges from abortion providers who aim to halt its implementation. Despite the bill not imposing civil or criminal penalties on women seeking an abortion, physicians who violate the law may face penalties determined by Iowa’s medical board, which has caused concerns about enforcement clarity.

The new law reflects a broader trend of restrictive abortion legislation in Republican-led states, particularly following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Governor Reynolds framed the law as a victory for pro-life advocates, while critics, including national Democratic figures, condemned it as extreme and harmful to women’s rights. Anti-abortion groups, on the other hand, have praised the law as a significant step in protecting unborn life."

Wade. The chief justice just made sure that wont happen before the 2020 election.By Emma GreenPeople holding signs opposing abortion stand in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. Patrick Semansky APJune 29, 2020ShareSave Chief Justice John Roberts balked.This morning, the Supreme Court announced its decision in June Medical Services v. Russo, the first big test of whether, and how, this Courtwith two Donald Trump appointeeswould revise abortion rights in the United States. When Trump was running for president, he explicitly promised to appoint judges who would automatically overturn Roe v. Wade, the case that established the constitutionality of abortion. Today, the Court has repudiated Trumps promise with its decision in June Medical. While the ruling does not signal that abortion is safe at the Supreme Court, its a message that anti-abortion advocates cannot simply expect the Court to reverse abortion rights just because conservative justices now dominate the bench.In 2018, when Justice Anthony Kennedy, who formerly acted as the Courts main swing voter on social issues, announced his retirement, commentators were quick to pronounce abortion rights dead Abortion will be illegal in twenty states in 18 months, tweeted the New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin. And yet, today, the liberal wing of the Court won.June Medical concerns a Louisiana law that required doctors who perform abortions to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, which in theory meant they could immediately address emergency medical situations that arise during the procedure, but in practice served to limit the number of medical professionals who can legally terminate pregnancies. In the judgment of the Court, this case is nearly identical to one it decided just four years ago, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, about a strikingly similar law in Texas. When faced with the prospect of overturning such a fresh precedenteven though he disagreed with the outcome of that caseRoberts was unwilling to potentially undermine the legitimacy of the Court.The Louisiana law that was at stake in June Medical embodies the anti-abortion movements strategy over the past decade. For at least the past 10 years, activists have pushed state-level regulations on abortion clinics. These restrictions are ostensibly designed to protect the health and safety of women. The vast majority of Americans support patient-protection laws because they recognize that abortion practitioners should meet the same standard of care as any other physician, Catherine Glenn Foster, the president and CEO of Americans United for Life, one of the national groups leading this effort, told me. When the Court considered a Texas law along these lines in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, however, it found that it placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. June Medical Services effectively asked the new conservative majority on the Court to overturn precedent, effectively giving a green light to anti-abortion activists who have worked to restrict abortion at the state level. Read The Supreme Court will soon test its commitment to abortion rights The composition of the Court appeared favorable to the challenge. Roberts voted with the minority in Whole Womans Health. And the new justices on the Court, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, are both conservatives who have written passionately about the importance of religion in America and have expressed skepticism of the Courts record on abortion rights. Despite these shared views on abortion jurisprudence, Roberts has recently been concerned about the Courts partisan appearance. Ive always thought this case was a particularly difficult ask for Roberts, who has been very public about his concern for the Courts reputation and institutional legitimacy, Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and the author of Abortion and the Law in America Roe v. Wade to the Present, told me. In 2018, Roberts went so far as to rebuke the presidents claim that judges can be relied on to vote a certain way simply because of who appointed them We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges, he told the Associated Press. Cases concerning abortion are arguably the ultimate test of this principle. It is a challenge for him, in this case, as many people would react to a Louisiana victory by accusing the Court of being an appendage of a political party, Cary Franklin, a law professor at the University of Texas, told me.In an opinion concurring with the majority decision, which was written by the liberal-leaning Justice Stephen Breyer, Roberts was explicit that he is not defending abortion rights. He is defending the Court. I joined the dissent in Whole Womans Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided, he wrote. The question today however is not whether Whole Womans Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case. The legal doctrine of stare decisis, which means to stand by things decided, requires courts to treat similar cases alike, he wrote. Otherwise, its difficult for Americans to know what the law actually says. While Louisiana had argued that the facts of this case were substantively different from those in Texas, Roberts didnt buy it. His unwillingness to go along with the argument that abortion regulations in each state should be treated differently is a clear signal to anti-abortion activists that they may have to shift their legal strategy. It may be popping the balloon of the anti-abortion movement, Ziegler said. Read The dishonesty of the abortion debateAnd yet, this decision does not mean that abortion rights will be automatically protected by the Supreme Court in future cases. Roberts was clear that he is still critical of the way Whole Womans Health was decided, and there are countless abortion-related challenges, focused on entirely different issues, currently winding their way through the federal court system. And the Court will likely continue to hear cases about incremental restrictions on abortion rights.Although Trumps appointments have shifted the Court in many significant ways, this case is a sign that the institution cannot be rapidly transformed to meet the political needs of the current administration. For groups that have worked closely with the president to change the makeup of the Supreme Court and limit abortion rights, the decision in June Medical is a major strategic loss. Todays ruling is a bitter disappointment, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an influential anti-abortion-rights advocacy organization, in a statement. It demonstrates once again the failure of the Supreme Court to allow the American people to protect the well-being of women from the tentacles of a brutal and profit-seeking abortion industry. For activists and scholars who support abortion rights, however, this is a victorynot just because the Court decided in their favor, but because it shows that even controversial issues such as abortion will not be wholly decided by political imperatives. We should celebrate because its also a sign that theres something going on, Aziza Ahmed, a law professor at Northeastern University, told me. We cant just assume that because we have a conservative majority, the right will always win.Emma Green is a staff writer at The New Yorker. Previously, she was a staff writer at The Atlantic, covering politics, policy, and religion.","In June Medical Services v. Russo, the Supreme Court upheld abortion rights, defying former President Donald Trump’s expectations that his appointees would swiftly overturn Roe v. Wade. Chief Justice John Roberts, despite his past opposition to Roe, voted with the liberal wing of the Court, emphasizing the importance of judicial consistency. The case involved a Louisiana law requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a regulation similar to one previously struck down in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. The Court ruled that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, reinforcing its previous decision and signaling that anti-abortion advocates could not rely solely on a conservative Court to overturn abortion rights.

Roberts’ decision was rooted in the legal principle of stare decisis, which calls for courts to adhere to precedent. Despite his personal opposition to Whole Woman’s Health, he acknowledged that the facts of the Louisiana case were not significantly different, making a departure from precedent unjustifiable. His vote was driven more by a desire to protect the Court’s institutional legitimacy than by support for abortion rights. While the ruling was a setback for anti-abortion advocates, it does not guarantee that abortion rights will be safe in the future, as the Court will continue to hear cases with other restrictions. Trump’s judicial appointments, though significant, cannot entirely reshape the Court to align with political agendas, as demonstrated in this case. The ruling is seen as a temporary victory for abortion rights, as it shows that political imperatives do not always dictate Supreme Court decisions."

Mike and Karen Pence pose for pictures following Mike Pence's campaign launch event in Ankeny, Iowa, in June 2023. STEPHEN MATURENAFPGetty Images Pence says he wants to ban abortion and support families but hasnt specified how Republican presidential hopefuls mostly arent backing paid family leave or increased child care subsidies even as they say they want to support families in the face of abortion restrictions. Mel Leonor Barclay Politics Reporter Published 2023-07-24 1312 112 July 24, 2023 pm Share Twitter Facebook Former Vice President Mike Pence has been vocal about his support for federal abortion restrictions. During an appearance on CNN last month, the GOP presidential hopeful was asked whether governments that restricted abortion had a financial responsibility to support families facing unexpected pregnancies. He responded that he supported such policies of compassion. If were going to stand for life, we have to care as much for newborns and mothers as we do for the unborn, Pence said. Asked if that included paid family leave and subsidized child care, Pence wouldnt say outright. While some Republican state legislatures have paired abortion bans with additional funding for social programs including to pay for diapers Republican presidential candidates pushing for federal restrictions have offered scant details about what kind of policies they would champion to explicitly support pregnant people and families. Advocates pushing for increased government support for women and families say proposals like a federal paid family leave program and increased federal subsidies to address the nations child care crisis are obvious family-friendly policies largely missing from the GOP campaign trail though, they say, they dont replace the need for accessible and legal reproductive care. When there have been opportunities to pass the policies that pregnant people and parenting people and families need to thrive, the vast majority of Republicans have opposed them, said Shaina Goodman, a policy expert with the National Partnership for Women and Families, which has for years championed a federal paid family and medical leave program. None of these policies, however, account for what it means to be pregnant when you dont want to be and what the process of pregnancy and childbirth does to someone physically, emotionally how it changes families, economically. The impact of abortion bans in post-Roe America is becoming more clear on a wide scale. An April study from the Society of Family Planning found a 6 percent drop in the number of legal abortions nationwide in the six months that followed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that put an end to federal abortion rights. The decline exceeded researchers projections. Even as the battle over abortion access continues to play out in states and at the federal level, the data represents permanent impact to the patchwork of American families. The leading Republican primary candidates are broadly supportive of abortion restrictions, but Pence has made federal abortion restrictions a cornerstone of his campaign, criticizing other GOP candidates for not going far enough on the issue. Pences campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In an interview with Politico, Pence said he supports public funding for anti-abortion counseling centers and to make adoption more affordable. Republican voters may be concerned by the impact of these changes. During a panel about the future of abortion restrictions at the Faith and Freedom Coalitions annual summit in Washington, D.C., in June, one woman who declined to share her name asked the panelists two anti-abortion state lawmakers and a representative of a religious adoption agency to address the nations overburdened foster care system. For every action, theres a reaction, she said, adding that her grandchildren were previously in foster care. Julie Kashen, a policy expert with the Century Foundation, a liberal think tank, said policies like increased federal subsidies for child care have broad bipartisan support. She said Republicans do champion child care and pointed to increases to the federal block grant program for child care during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden in April signed an executive order related to the federal block grant program that would cap child care fees for families and urge states to accept online applications to improve access.

Kim Reynolds signs abortion bill, her power in GOP is on full display Why the DeSantis campaign is betting on the political power of mamas Kashen said support falls short among Republicans when talking about building a program that guarantees that every family has access to child care and that workers are paid competitive, livable wages. She pointed to the Build Back Better Act championed by Biden, which at one point included significant funding to build out a pre-K system for the country that targeted both middle- and low-income families. The proposal cleared the Democrat-controlled House but did not make it out of the Senate. We did not see Republican support for it in the Senate, Kashen said. And that was the closest weve gotten in 50 years. E.V. Osment of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which recently held an event with Pence to mark the anniversary of the Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization decision, said the group stood in support of federal financial and physical resources for families facing pregnancy. Osment said the group backs a bill introduced by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio that, among other things, increases the child tax credit and allows parents to use their Social Security benefits to take three months of paid parental leave. Kashen said such policies can force families to decide between retirement security and caring for a new child. Most Americans know what true policies of compassion are. They are what weve been fighting for for decades, including child care for all, paid family and medical leave for all, support for people with disabilities and our aging loved ones. And the freedom to make decisions about when and what our families look like, Kashen said. Recommended for you A born alive measure is one of the House GOPs priorities.

Our stories are free to republish in accordance with these guidelines. Events Jobs About Us Community Guidelines Membership Membership FAQ Ways to Give Sponsorship Privacy Instagram","Mike Pence, a Republican presidential candidate, has been a vocal advocate for federal abortion restrictions, positioning the issue as central to his campaign. He has stated his support for policies that show “compassion” for mothers and newborns, though he has not provided specific details on measures such as paid family leave or subsidized childcare, which many advocates believe are necessary to support families facing unplanned pregnancies. When asked about these policies, Pence avoided committing to specifics, despite recognizing the importance of supporting families.

While some states have paired abortion bans with social programs like diaper subsidies, GOP candidates, including Pence, have not detailed policies to directly support pregnant people and families at the federal level. Advocates argue that such policies, such as a federal paid family leave program and increased childcare subsidies, are essential but largely absent from the GOP agenda. They also emphasize that such measures cannot replace the need for legal and accessible reproductive care.

A study found that abortion rates dropped by 6% after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end federal abortion rights, revealing the lasting impact on families across the country. While Pence has emphasized public funding for anti-abortion counseling and making adoption more affordable, critics, including Julie Kashen from the Century Foundation, argue that there is insufficient GOP support for comprehensive family policies, such as guaranteeing childcare access and ensuring livable wages for childcare workers.

Pence’s views align with conservative groups that support additional financial resources for families, such as increasing the child tax credit and allowing Social Security benefits for parental leave. However, some experts, like Kashen, argue that such policies could place families in difficult positions, forcing them to choose between financial security and child-rearing support. Advocates for broader social safety nets, such as paid leave and universal childcare, argue these policies are essential for supporting families without restricting reproductive rights."

State of Texas. Credit Joe TimmermanThe Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribunes daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. One woman could barely get words out through her tears. Another ran to the restroom as soon as she was done, wordless, wretched sobs wracking her tiny body. A third threw up on the witness stand. These are believed to be the first women in the country since 1973 to testify in court about the impacts of a state abortion ban on their pregnancies. They almost certainly wont be the last. Speaking to a packed Travis County courtroom Wednesday, three women detailed devastating pregnancy losses and said medically necessary care was delayed or denied due to their doctors confusion over Texas abortion laws. Theyre challenging a clause in the states abortion ban that says a doctor can perform an abortion only if they believe the patient has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that puts the patient at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function. Doctors have reported delaying necessary pregnancy care for fear of violating the law, which allows doctors to be punished by up to 99 years in prison, a 100,000 fine and the loss of their medical license. The lawsuit, brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights, asks a judge to temporarily block the law from applying to medically necessary abortions and ultimately clarify when a medical emergency justifies an abortion. Related Story Women denied abortions sue Texas to clarify exceptions to the laws Updated March 7, 2023 Texas is asking District Judge Jessica Mangrum to dismiss the case, arguing these women have only their doctors to blame for any disruptions to their care. At the end of each tearful testimony, lawyers for the state asked the women the same questions Did Attorney General Ken Paxton tell you you couldnt get an abortion? Did anyone, working in any capacity for the state, tell you you couldnt get an abortion? Amanda Zurawski As soon as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to set their own laws about abortion, Texas descended into legal uncertainty. The state already banned nearly all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, enforced entirely through private lawsuits. The day of the ruling, Paxton issued guidance indicating that the states pre-Roe statutes, which have been on the books since before the Civil War, were also in effect. Before a court could confirm whether Paxtons guidance was accurate, the states trigger ban went into effect, banning all abortions from the moment of conception, with only an exception to save the life of the pregnant patient. Amanda Zurawski learned the trigger law had gone into effect from a hospital bed in Austin, watching the only channel she could get on the television. She was in septic shock and would eventually spend three days in the intensive care unit. Just three days prior, Zurawski had been proceeding through her pregnancy as planned, carrying a baby girl she and her husband had hoped, prayed and endured grueling rounds of fertility treatments to conceive. She suddenly noticed fluid leaking down her leg and her body felt wider than usual. Her cervix was dilating early, and she had lost the amniotic fluid she needed to maintain her pregnancy. Her doctor told her miscarriage was inevitable, she testified Wednesday, but since there was still a fetal heartbeat, they could not induce labor. She went to the hospital for a second opinion and heard the same verdict She would have to wait until she miscarried naturally, or got sick enough that doctors felt legally safe to induce an abortion. She considered traveling to a state where abortion remains legal, but her doctors told her the situation was so dire she needed to stay within 15 minutes of a hospital. Zurawski was devastated, grappling with the sudden loss of her pregnancy, the confusing medical advice, and the hesitation and fear she sensed from all the doctors and nurses. Every time they checked the babys heartbeat, Zurawski was forced to cartwheel through the stages of grief all over again. I had to listen to her heartbeat, simultaneously wanting to hear it and not wanting to hear it at the same time, she said on the witness stand Wednesday, speaking through tears. If it stopped, they would be able to intervene. She was at home when she started to descend into septic shock. She was shaking, her teeth chattering, so freezing cold despite the August heat in Austin. Her husband rushed her to the hospital, where they pumped her with antibiotics. Finally, her doctor agreed to induce labor. She delivered a deceased daughter. They named her Willow, after a tree that grows both in Central Texas, where the Zurawskis live, and Indiana, where they are from. It means strength in adversity, she said Wednesday. They plan to plant a willow tree in her honor at their new house, which they bought when they learned they were pregnant. Zurawski and her husband would still like to have children, but tests have revealed significant scarring and damage to her reproductive organs as a result of the infection. Zurawski said she didnt blame her medical providers, who were rightfully fearful in the early, confusing days after the trigger law went into effect. She said Wednesday that she blames only the people who support these bans. Samantha Casiano wipes away tears as she gives testimony in a Travis County courtroom on Wednesday. Screenshot via 353RD District Court Samantha Casiano Speaking to a courtroom full of lawyers, reporters and supporters, Samantha Casiano described the day she held her baby daughter, Halo, and watched her gasp out her first and final breaths. Over the course of four hours, Halo went from pink to red to purple, from being warm to cold, Casiano said Wednesday. As she held her little body, Casiano apologized, again and again. I was so sorry that I couldnt help her or release her going to heaven sooner rather than later, Casiano recounted for the court through sobs. I felt so bad. She had no mercy. There was no mercy there for her, and I couldnt do anything. When Casiano learned her fetus had anencephaly, a fetal anomaly that prevented the skull and brainstem from developing fully, she thought maybe she could have surgery to fix it. Her doctor explained the diagnosis was incompatible with life Halo wouldnt survive outside the womb but offered little in the way of options. Casiano considered traveling out of state, but with a job, persistent car trouble and other children waiting for her at home, she couldnt figure out a way to make the long trip in a hurry. So she carried the pregnancy for an additional 13 weeks before eventually going into labor. As Casiano described the experience to the court, she began to cry, then she began to cough, then she threw up in her hands, as her husband and a bailiff rushed to the witness stand with wastebaskets. When the court reconvened, she explained in a small, sad voice that she never used to throw up, but now, it happens all the time. I vomit when certain parts of what happen just kind of make my body remember and it just reacts, she said. On cross-examination, the state questioned Casianos prescription for antidepressants, which her doctor increased after the diagnosis, and asked whether Paxton or anyone from the state had told her she couldnt have an abortion. I almost want to say yes, she said, noting that if shed had a chance to ask anyone at the state, they would have told her there was a law in place that prohibited doctors from performing abortions in most cases. But no, she said. No one from the state told her anything. Ashley Brandt When Ashley Brandt learned that one of the twins she was carrying had a lethal fetal anomaly called acrania, she was devastated. That devastation only grew when she learned that the longer she continued her pregnancy with both twins, the greater the risk to herself and the other fetus, which was developing properly. She needed to terminate one fetus for the other to survive, but her doctors in Texas said the states new abortion laws prevented them from helping her until her condition worsened. She and her husband scrambled together money and childcare to get to Colorado, where the procedure took mere minutes. When she returned, she experienced bleeding. But she was hesitant to go to the doctor, she said, because she felt like a criminal. Ashley Brandt holds hands with her husband, Marcus Brandt, following the first day of testimony in Zurawski v. State of Texas. I knew I needed, just for peace of mind, to be checked, she said, choking out the words between sobs. But because I had gone out of state for an illegal procedure, I was kind of worried about explaining it to the doctors there. I didn't want anyone to get in trouble and I didn't want to get in trouble. She eventually went to the emergency room for care. The rest of her pregnancy continued without incident, and she delivered her thriving daughter by cesarean section at 38 weeks. I don't blame my OB or my specialists, she said. The law does not take cases like mine into consideration. I did have an anesthesiologist during my C-section who was a state rep, Cypress Republican Tom Oliverson, and so I do know that he supports the abortion bans and laws so I do put blame on him. Doctors Speak Lawyers for the plaintiffs also brought four doctors to the witness stand to testify Dr. Damla Karsan, Dr. Aaron Caughey, Dr. Ali Raja and Dr. Austin Dennard. Karsan, a Houston OB-GYN, told the court that the abortion ban's medical exemption is vague and doesn't work in practice. She told a story of a patient whose fetus was attached to the placenta a severe condition that is incompatible with life and who was bleeding from the placenta. Karsan said this woman drove 14 hours to Albuquerque, with her husband and toddler in tow, to receive an abortion, which Karsan believes was medically necessary. I feel like my hands are tied, Karsan said. I have the skills and training to provide the care but I'm unable to, and it's gut-wrenching, In the cross examination, the state focused on the rarity of cases where Karsan believed she was unable to provide a medically necessary abortion. Speaking at a press conference after the hearing Wednesday, she said this wasnt just about her experience. I want everyone to consider how many OB-GYN and family practitioners that do obstetrics in rural areas, and nurse midwives are taking care of pregnant patients in this state, Karsan said. Every single one of them has had these experiences. On Thursday, Caughey, an OB-GYN and epidemiologist based in Oregon, and Raja, executive vice chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, provided similar statements to Karsan. They both testified that the laws medical exception is vague and could confuse Texas practitioners. The threat of life in prison or the loss of a medical license will make many doctors err on the side of not treating patients, Raja said. The states cross-examination focused not on the merits of Caughey and Rajas arguments, but rather on whether they were qualified to make them, noting that they both practice out of state. Caughey and Raja testified that there is a national standard of care meaning that though neither have practiced medicine in Texas, their expertise carries across state lines. The state put forward their own expert witness, Dr. Ingrid Skop, a San Antonio OB-GYN who is also vice-president and director of medical affairs for the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute. Skop agreed that doctors are fearful, confused and likely withholding medically appropriate care because of the law. But she said the accountability lies with medical associations and hospital management which have not sufficiently clarified the law. I think it is clear that the Texas law allows treatment of life-threatening conditions, Skop told the judge. It is not the laws fault. A new era of legal challenges Over the past few decades, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the attorney generals office have found themselves in a courtroom just like this one countless times, arguing over the legality of Texas abortion laws. Historically, abortion providers were named on the lawsuits and testified on the stand, in an effort to spare the women most impacted by these laws from the pain of public testimony. At a press conference after the hearing, Molly Duane, senior counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said it was difficult to have to walk these women through the worst moments of their lives, but they did it to hold the state of Texas accountable. Molly Duane, third from left, stands with women who testified Wednesday in Zurawski v. State of Texas. As a lawyer, you generally dont want to cry during work but it was hard not to, Duane told The Texas Tribune afterward. It helps people understand how abortion actually is health care. Because I can say it, and doctors can say it, but when these women say it, people can see themselves. But there are no more abortion clinics in Texas. These women took the stand Wednesday because there is no one else left to speak for them. For the women who took the stand, reliving their experiences for the sake of a courtroom full of people was deeply painful. They stood together after the hearing, comforting each other and rubbing each others backs, leaning on their partners and each other for support. Samantha Casiano hugs her husband, Luis Fernando Villasana. I was horrified by how willing the cross examination was to ask over and over again about the most horrific thing thats ever happened to me, seemingly with nothing but callousness, Zurawski said after the hearing. I survived sepsis, and I dont think that today was much less traumatic. During the most recent regular legislative session, Texas passed a law that provided some additional protections for doctors who perform abortions in cases of ectopic pregnancies and previable premature rupture of membranes, both of which can be fatal if left untreated. The law goes into effect Sept. 1. Assistant Attorney General Amy Pletscher said while these womens stories are indisputably tragic, they do not warrant a judge taking steps to modify the laws. Any future harm is purely hypothetical and therefore does not warrant injunctive relief, Pletscher told the judge. Given the nature of plaintiffs past experiences, it is understandable that they are seeking to place blame, but the blame directed at defendants is misplaced. Rather, plaintiffs sustained their alleged injuries as a direct result of their own medical providers failing them. Standing before the judge Wednesday, Duane said the state has long argued that clinics do not have standing to challenge abortion law and claimed it is unlawful to challenge abortion laws before they go into effect. But now that the Center for Reproductive Rights has brought a suit with plaintiffs who are directly harmed as a result of the trigger law, the state still says there are no grounds for a suit. It begs the question Does the state think that the only person who would have standing to challenge an abortion law is a woman who comes to court with amniotic fluid or blood dripping down her leg? After two days of testimony, Mangrum said she would weigh the evidence and expected to rule in a matter of weeks.

Wade decision. Their testimony highlighted the confusion and delays caused by the state’s abortion laws, which restrict abortions to cases where the pregnancy poses a life-threatening risk to the mother. These women are challenging a clause in the Texas law, which they argue makes it unclear when a medical emergency justifies an abortion.

Amanda Zurawski shared her experience of losing her pregnancy after a medical emergency, during which her doctors were hesitant to intervene due to legal uncertainty. Despite suffering from septic shock and significant health risks, her doctors were unable to provide timely care because the fetus still had a heartbeat, as required by the law. Similarly, Samantha Casiano recounted the heartbreaking experience of carrying her anencephalic daughter, who had no chance of survival, for 13 weeks due to restrictions in Texas law. Ashley Brandt faced a similarly difficult situation, needing an abortion to protect one of her twins from a lethal condition, but was forced to travel out of state to receive the procedure.

The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, seeks to clarify when medical emergencies justify abortions and temporarily block the law from applying to medically necessary procedures. Several doctors testified, expressing concerns about the law’s vagueness and the fear it instills in medical professionals, who may hesitate to provide necessary care due to the threat of severe legal consequences. In contrast, Texas state representatives argued that the law’s medical exceptions are clear and that the women’s issues stemmed from their doctors’ failure to act.

This case reflects the broader challenges faced by Texas residents following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, with abortion providers no longer able to challenge the law on behalf of patients. The outcome of the trial, expected in a few weeks, could provide clarity on the legal implications of Texas’ abortion restrictions."

The actions of the FDA under the Biden administrations influence have made it clear that states are the first and only line of defense protecting women and the preborn from these deadly pills, says SFLActions Meredith Stratmann. MONTGOMERY, AL and WASHINGTON D.C. 04-28-2021 Students for Life Actions Meredith Stratmann, the Southern Regional Intern with both Students for Life of America and SFL Action, is scheduled to speak today before the Alabama House Judiciary Committee on H.B. 377, the Chemical Abortion Ban introduced by Rep. Andrew Sorrell, which would ban deadly Chemical Abortion Pills from being sold and distributed in state. Video of the 130 p.m. Central event can be seen here. SFLAction has been a leader in the fight to stop Chemical Abortion Pill distribution. Click here to read more about the 14 states that engaged this legislative session on the issue. Pictures and video of the event will be available after at Students for Life Actions website, but Stratmann will make some of the following remarks on behalf of the 11 Students for Life groups in high schools and colleges across the state of Alabama, part of SFLAs almost 1,300 student groups in every state across the country. She observes Were just getting started in a massive effort to fight back against predatory corporate abortion interests and oppose them at every turn in this new frontier of chemical abortions. The actions of the FDA under the Biden administrations influence have made it clear that states are the first and only line of defense protecting women and the preborn from these deadly pills. By using the pandemic as an excuse to gut federal safeguards requiring in-person dispensing, the FDA has blown open the door for those who traffic and coerce women, with little regard for the reportedly 3 to 8 percent who will be left to suffer significant complications requiring emergency care. Thats between a hundred and twenty thousand and three hundred and twenty thousand women who will experience these complications. Because these abortions are committed at home or even in a college dorm, many women may not even realize they are experiencing an adverse effect. The patient and healthcare provider relationship is distant at best, and in some cases, the doctor may be in a completely different state. Chemical abortions do not provide the necessary observation in which healthcare professionals would be able to catch the signs and symptoms of a complication. That medical judgement is left up to a woman at home by herself, likely googling her symptoms and trying to decide if shes just being paranoid. These pills are dangerous to women, and lethal to babies. They end the life of a preborn child, and are even more dangerous to women than surgical abortion, causing 4x more complications. The pills can cause infertility if used improperly and can even be slipped into the drinks of pregnant women. Planned Parenthood has set up authorization in all 50 states that would make it possible to bring deadly chemical abortion pills to underage girls across the nation on-line with just a few clicks, confidentially, with no safeguards or follow-up care in their new Abortion by Amazon world. In addition to not being safe, there is no legal protection for chemical abortion in Alabama. In 2018, an amendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 declared and affirmed the public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of preborn life and the rights of preborn children. The amendment made it clear that the Constitution of Alabama of 1901 does not include a right to an abortion. I urge you to act in accordance with this precedent and vote to protect the rights of the preborn. Chemical abortions are not safe and can have long term negative effects on women and their fertility. Please vote yes on House Bill 377 to protect women and children from the abortion industry. Recently, Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins and Sen. Steve Daines co-authored an op-ed in Newsweek detailing the current crisis and how political activists are playing politics to advance abortion. They wrote The Biden administrations chemical abortion gambit also reveals a deep hypocrisy. Consider that on the same day news was breaking about the gutted health and safety standards for chemical abortion, the FDA also announced it was pulling the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccine because, out of 7 million people who had taken it, six had suffered blood clots and one person died. Yet despite the fact that chemical abortion pills have been a factor in the deaths of more than 20 women and millions of unborn children, Bidens FDA not only kept the drugs on the market, but authorized, in effect, a nationwide experiment in do-it-yourself abortions. There was no semblance of an abundance of caution in the FDAs abortion pill announcement. Learn more about how Chemical Abortion harms women and preborn children at THISISCHEMICALABORTION.com.

This bill, introduced by Rep. Andrew Sorrell, aims to protect women and preborn children by preventing the sale and use of these pills. Stratmann emphasized that the FDA’s recent actions, under the Biden administration, have made it easier for dangerous chemical abortion pills to be distributed, especially by allowing their remote dispensing during the COVID-19 pandemic. She highlighted the risks posed by these pills, including significant health complications for women—ranging from 3% to 8% of users—who may require emergency care. Furthermore, the pills are more dangerous than surgical abortion, causing four times as many complications.

Stratmann argued that these pills are not only harmful to women but also end the lives of preborn children. She pointed out that women using these pills often face a distant patient-provider relationship, with no adequate monitoring for potential complications. The pills also have the potential for misuse, including being secretly administered to women, and can cause long-term health effects such as infertility.

The testimony also touched on the broader issue of Planned Parenthood’s role in facilitating the distribution of these pills online, making them easily accessible with minimal oversight or safeguards. Stratmann urged the committee to pass H.B. 377, citing Alabama’s constitutional amendment affirming the sanctity of preborn life, and to align with the state’s public policy of protecting the rights of the unborn.

Students for Life Action has been at the forefront of opposing chemical abortion, working alongside other pro-life organizations to raise awareness and push for state-level protections. Stratmann’s remarks were part of a broader effort by the pro-life community to combat the increasing prevalence of chemical abortions and protect both women and children from their dangerous consequences."

It seems that societys problem with reacting negatively to babies who rock an extra chromosome! as Poirier says, is more with the stigma than the actual diagnosis. SFLA had the opportunity to talk with Poirier about the societal challenge and triumphs of raising a child with Down syndrome and her overflowing joy is an incredible testament to the truth that all babies are a gift, not a nuisance. Would you tell us about you and Alices story? When I was 32, I gave birth to my second child, a daughter named Alice. At the time, I also had a two-year-old daughter named Lucy. When Alice was about an hour old, we were told that she likely had Down syndrome. My husband and I knew nothing about Down syndrome at the time and we were crushed. The doctor asked me if I had done any prenatal testing for Down syndrome and I told her no because we are pro-life. She kind of rolled her eyes at me, as if I should have done it and then aborted when the test came back positive for Down syndrome. When Alice was a few months old, I found out the abortion statistics for babies with Down syndrome. In Iceland, it is 100. They have not had a baby with Down syndrome born in the last five years, as all babies are screened prenatally and then aborted if a positive Down syndrome test comes back. In the US, the Down syndrome abortion stats are about 70. Those numbers are sickening to me, especially because Down syndrome has been nothing like we thought it would be. It is nothing but a tremendous blessing. Today, Alice is a happy, healthy, spunky, smart two-year-old girl. She says a few words, she runs around and she makes everyone around her better, more accepting and more loving. Has this experience impacted your involvement in the pro-life movement? I have always been pro-life, but my passion for the pro-life movement has increased so much since having Alice. I firmly believe that the high statistics for Down syndrome abortion are due to the way the doctors present the diagnosis as if it is going to be absolutely horrible, when that actually couldnt be further from the truth. I have heard of so many of my friends now who received a prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis and the doctor followed it up with, So do you want to get an abortion? As a result, Im doing everything I can do to change the diagnosis experience. I recently wrote a letter to new Down syndrome parents. It is true, positive, and hopeful. It just got picked up by Yahoo. You can find it here. My goal is to have this letter given out with every Down syndrome diagnosis, whether thats prenatal or at-birth like ours. I want women to know the joy that their baby will bring not the lies about how horrible it is going to be. I firmly believe that this will change the outcomes in terms of the abortion statistics. Could you tell me about your daughter? What is it like raising her? Alice is amazing! She is a happy, healthy two-year-old. She says a few words, she runs around and she makes everyone better. Raising her is incredibly easy. Babies with Down syndrome are known for being easygoing and generally pretty happy. She is no exception to that! When we first received Alices Down syndrome diagnosis, I thought we would be in constant doctors appointments and having to spend so much money and time on caring for her. This couldnt be further from the truth. She is 100 healthy and doesnt require any more medical care or cost than our other two kids. She is a gem to raise. Theres a lot of negativity surrounding babies with Down syndrome. Did you receive any negative reactions about your childs diagnosis, from doctors, family, or anyone? Oh yes. The doctor who told me that Alice likely had Down syndrome said it in a very negative way and basically told me that I should have screened for it prenatally. Alices pediatrician also asked me why I didnt screen for Down syndrome prenatally. I promptly switched pediatricians. My husbands family and my family, on the other hand, couldnt have been more thrilled about Alice. Her Down syndrome diagnosis simply didnt matter to them. They loved her from the moment they met her every part of her, including and especially her Down syndrome! We had a few doctors and friends tell us that they were sorry that Alice has Down syndrome. I was quick to let them know that theres nothing to be sorry about. I really believe people dont know what to say, so they say theyre sorry, but its not with bad intent. They are just not educated about Down syndrome and dont know what to say. The best thing to say is Congratulations like you would with any other baby, and then to tell them that theyve been chosen for an incredible ride and that Down syndrome will soon become their biggest blessing. Because it will. Tell me about your own work and how you interweave your journalism, working and writing in the pro-life movement, with your personal experience through raising your daughter? I have always worked in journalism. I knew I wanted to be a writer since I was a little girl. I have a degree in English and public relations from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. In college, I was the managing editor of the school newspaper. After college, I worked as a writer for a few marketing agencies. After having my first baby, I quit my job to be a stay-at-home mom but I continued freelance writing for a few local magazines. When we had Alice, it gave me a unique opportunity to use my writing in a new way. I started my blog when she was a month old. I knew I had to start a blog to tell people about the reality of Down syndrome not the myths and to share the story of my beautiful new daughter. On my blog, I write all about Alice and Down syndrome with the goal of changing peoples perceptions. My hope and prayer is that someone who has just received a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome and is considering abortion finds my blog, gets a new perspective and decides to keep her child. What would you say to a mother who just found out her child hasmay have down syndrome? CONGRATULATIONS! I know you arent there yet, but its going to be OK. Its going to be awesome. Forget what you think you know about Down syndrome, as it will soon become your biggest blessing. You are the perfect mom for this baby, and this baby is the perfect child for you. You were chosen for this role! Just love your baby. Loving the diagnosis will come soon after. You can follow Poiriers work on her blog Wonderland Mommy to hear more about her family and mission.

When Alice was born, the doctors informed Poirier and her husband that she likely had Down syndrome. Though initially shocked, they were unprepared for the stigma and misconceptions that accompanied the diagnosis, especially after learning about the high abortion rates for Down syndrome pregnancies in countries like Iceland (100%) and the U.S. (70%).

Poirier emphasizes that Down syndrome has been nothing but a blessing for her family. Alice is a happy, healthy, and energetic toddler, requiring no more medical care than her siblings. She debunks the negative stereotypes surrounding Down syndrome, citing her positive experiences with Alice’s health and behavior. Poirier also reflects on the negative reactions from some doctors, including one who questioned her decision not to screen for Down syndrome, and others who expressed misplaced sympathy. However, her family remained supportive and embraced Alice wholeheartedly.

This experience led Poirier to become even more passionate about the pro-life movement. She believes that the high abortion rates are partly due to the negative way doctors present the diagnosis of Down syndrome and the misinformation about the condition’s challenges. She has since written a letter to new parents of children with Down syndrome, offering hope and encouragement, and aims to change the narrative by providing positive, truthful information about the condition.

As a journalist, Poirier started a blog to share Alice’s story and advocate for better education about Down syndrome. She encourages expectant mothers who receive a Down syndrome diagnosis to remain hopeful, assuring them that their child is a perfect gift and that the journey will be a rewarding one.

In conclusion, Poirier’s story is a powerful testament to the joys of raising a child with Down syndrome, challenging societal stigmas, and advocating for a more positive outlook on life for families facing similar diagnoses."

From the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act, to threats to reproductive health care, the outcome of this election will have major consequences for women and the nation as a whole. The track records and the positions of the candidates on these issues offer a stark contrast to voters. This brief reviews the key issues that are likely to have a direct impact on womens health as well as their access to coverage and care, and summarizes the presidential candidates stated positions and records on these issues. President Donald Trumps positions reflect his record during his presidency, his 2020 campaign website, and the Republican party platform, which is unchanged from 2016. Joe Bidens positions reflect the policy agenda articulated on his 2020 campaign website, the Democratic party platform, the Unity Task Force Recommendations, and his record as a U.S. senator and as Vice President during the administration of President Barack Obama. The Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act ACA made many changes that have strengthened access to coverage for millions of women in the U.S. The law did away with longstanding policies that insurance plans used to discriminate against women. Today, all plans must include maternity care which was the norm in employer plans but not in individually-purchased insurance before the ACA and no-cost recommended preventive services including mammograms, prenatal and well woman care, and contraceptive services and supplies. Medicare beneficiaries also benefit from no-cost coverage for preventive services recommended for older women such as mammograms and bone density testing. Plans are not permitted to charge women more for coverage than men. The law also established consumer protections that guarantee people with a pre-existing health condition including pregnancy are not denied or charged more for individual insurance, and made coverage more accessible and affordable by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies to many people purchasing coverage on their own in the ACA Marketplace. The ACAs future is uncertain, as the laws constitutionality will once again be considered by the Supreme Court, scheduled for one week after the election. If the Supreme Court ultimately decides that all or most of the ACA must be overturned, as the Trump Administration now argues, the consequences would be complex and far-reaching. Table 1 Comparing the Candidates on the Affordable Care Act Donald Trump R Joe Biden D Supported numerous unsuccessful Republican-led legislative efforts to repeal and replace the ACA. Signed legislation that reduced the individual mandate penalty to 0, effectively eliminating the requirement to hold qualified health coverage. Is supporting a lawsuit before the Supreme Court to overturn the entire ACA, with no plan to replace it. Promoted and expanded access to short-term plans which typically lack many of the protections that were included in the ACA reforms, including maternity care, mental health, or prescription drugs. Cut funding for consumer outreach and enrollment assistance programs in the ACA Marketplace while redirecting some of those funds to promote short-term health plans. Supports retaining and expanding upon the ACA. Proposed creating a new federal public health insurance option similar to Medicare, referred to as the public option, and would automatically enroll uninsured adults who live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid, with no premium and full Medicaid benefits. Has called for increasing financial assistance available to families through the ACA marketplaces and broadening eligibility for these subsidies. Does not support a Medicare for All health care system and supports the continued role of private insurance in health care. Reproductive Health Reproductive health care is a core element of womens health and has been at the center of many partisan debates, particularly with regard to abortion and contraception.1 CONTRACEPTION The ACA, Medicaid policy, and the federal Title X family planning program shape womens access to a broad range of contraceptive services. However, access to and funding for contraception has been at the center of heated political disputes. Contraceptive Coverage. The ACA requires most individual and employer-sponsored health insurance plans to cover certain preventive services, including FDA-approved, prescribed contraception, at no cost to enrollees. Although the public largely supports this requirement, it has been controversial among some religious employers since it took effect in 2012 and has been the focus of three major Supreme Court cases. Title X. For more than 50 years, the Title X family planning program has supported the delivery of reproductive health services, including contraception and STI testing and treatment, to millions of low-income women, men, and teens at low or no cost. Two-thirds of Title X clients are people of color. Over the past decade, federal budget reductions and freezes have resulted in significant financial cutbacks to the Title X program. In addition, some congressional leaders have questioned the need to continue to fund the program, the types of services that the program can cover, and the types of providers that qualify for reimbursement. Table 2 Comparing the Candidates on Access to Contraception Issued regulations that allow nearly any employer with a religious or moral objection to be exempt from the ACAs requirement to include no-cost contraceptive coverage. Signed legislation nullifying Obama administration rule that prohibited exclusion of abortion providers in the Title X family planning program. Issued regulations that disqualify any provider that offers or refers for abortion services from Title X. Since the rules have been promulgated, 26 of Title X clinics have left the network, including all Planned Parenthood clinics, and the number of people served by the program has dropped from nearly 850,000 to 3.1 million. Redirected Title X family planning funds to crisis pregnancy centers, also known as pregnancy resource centers, which do not provide contraception. Sought to terminate the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program TPPP and redirect funding to abstinence-until-marriage educational programs which have been demonstrated to be ineffective in preventing teen pregnancy and STIs and potentially harmful. Rescinded 2016 free choice of provider guidance that had barred state Medicaid programs from excluding abortion providers without evidence of wrongdoing Approved a waiver from Texass Medicaid program to block Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood and other providers affiliated with an abortion provider for non-abortion family planning services. Has pledged to work to ensure people with employer-sponsored insurance have access to no-cost contraceptive coverage regardless of their employers beliefs, with Obama-era exemptions for houses of worship and accommodations for religious non-profits. The new public option he has envisioned would cover no-cost contraception for enrollees. Would reverse the Trump administrations Title X rule and restore funds to family planning clinics that also provide or refer for abortion. Would reinstate free choice of provider guidance that prohibits states from excluding qualified abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs without evidence of wrongdoing. Abortion Access to abortion is a hotly debated womens health issue in any presidential election, and even more so this election with the nomination of a new Supreme Court justice. In the years since the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade legalizing abortion in all states, a number of state and federal laws have been enacted to restrict access to abortion services, including waiting periods, gestational limits, and regulating which procedures may be offered and by which types of providers. Roe v. Wade. Several states have enacted abortion restrictions that effectively outlaw abortion, hoping the new conservative majority at the Supreme Court will reconsider the precedents set in Roe v. Wade, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt and ultimately weaken or overturn the rulings, allowing states to ban or regulate abortion without demonstrating that the benefit to women outweighs the burden. It is widely expected that the Supreme Court will review such a case in the coming term or soon after. Hyde Amendment. Soon after the Roe v. Wade decision, the Hyde Amendment was added to federal appropriations laws to limit federal funding for abortion to only those pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest, or that pose a threat to the life of the pregnant person. The Hyde Amendment is not permanent law, but rather a rider to appropriations bills that has been renewed annually by Congress. The Hyde Amendment drastically limits coverage of abortion under Medicaid and other federal programs, disproportionately impacting women of color and those who are low-income and covered by Medicaid. Table 3 Comparing the Candidates on Abortion Has expressed strong opposition to abortion and support for overturning Roe v. Wade. Has pledged to nominate pro-life judges. Appointed two Supreme Court Justices since taking office, both of whom have anti-abortion records, and who most recently ruled to uphold a Louisiana hospital admitting privileges law that would have made it nearly impossible for abortion providers to keep practicing in the state. Has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Judge Barrett has gone on record criticizing the Roe v. Wade decision and opposes abortion. Has pledged to make the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment of the pregnant person, permanent law. Has made many false and inflammatory statements about abortion, including falsely equating abortions that occur later in pregnancy with infanticide. Signed executive order requiring that infants born prematurely or that survive an abortion receive medical care. Similar federal laws already exist. Issued regulations not currently in effect which add new billing and payment requirements for ACA Marketplace plans that cover abortion, which may reduce the number of plans with coverage for abortion services. Eliminated anti-discrimination regulatory protections in health care for patients who have terminated a pregnancy. Reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy which prohibits U.S. global health funding assistance from going to foreign non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning, even with their own funds. Would work to codify Roe v. Wade. Pledged in a 2019 Democratic presidential candidate survey on abortion to nominate federal judges who will uphold Roe v. Wade. Pledged that his Justice Department will stop state laws that restrict access to abortion, including mandatory waiting periods and targeted restrictions on abortion providers TRAP laws. Called for repeal of the Hyde Amendment from congressional appropriations bills. Proposes requiring coverage of abortion services in at least some circumstances in his public option health insurance plan. Would reverse Trump administration policies that permit health care providers to discriminate against patients who have terminated a pregnancy and allows providers to refuse to provide abortion care. Would rescind the Mexico City Policy, also referred to as the global gag rule. Maternal Mortality Approximately 700 women die each year in the U.S. as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications, most of which are preventable. The maternal mortality rate has risen over the past few decades, with pronounced racial and ethnic disparities and gaps in maternity care services in many rural communities. To improve maternal health, Congress has taken up several bills that include proposals to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to one year, which would help connect low-income women to prenatal and postpartum care fund clinical training on health equity and implicit bias enhance data collection diversify the perinatal workforce and develop broader maternity care provider networks in rural areas. Table 4 Comparing the Candidates on Maternal Mortality Signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018 which provides funding and new federal infrastructure to state, local, and tribal maternal mortality review committees to collect, analyze, and report data related to pregnancy-associated deaths. Implemented the Maternal Opioid Misuse MOM model, a program that aims to improve systems of care for low-income pregnant and postpartum women struggling with opioid use disorder. Released a rural health action plan that, among other goals, aims to improve access to pregnancy care in rural communities. No stated positions on campaign website. Supports the ACAs Medicaid expansion, which helps connect women to care before, during, and after childbirth. Research has found that the maternal mortality ratio is lower in states that have adopted Medicaid expansion compared to non-expansion states. Would automatically enroll uninsured adults who live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid into proposed public health insurance option, without premiums or cost sharing. This includes postpartum women who may be dropped from Medicaid after 60 days postpartum in non-expansion states. Has pledged to address maternal mortality by adopting Californias model, which established a public-private partnership to investigate maternal deaths and has helped reduce the states maternal death rate by half. Platform highlights the need to address the wide racial disparities in maternal mortality, particularly among black and Native American women. Sexual Violence 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men in the U.S. report experiencing sexual violence involving physical contact in their lifetimes. In recent years, the issue of sexual and domestic violence has gained more recognition as a preventable health problem that disproportionately affects womens health outcomes. Violence Against Women Act. The most notable law that addresses sexual violence is the Violence Against Women Act VAWA, signed in 1994. VAWA helps establish many violence prevention efforts, such as funding rape crisis centers, shelters for those who have experienced domestic violence, and other support services for survivors. VAWA expired in 2018, although some VAWA programs are still funded at their usual level. The House of Representatives passed the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2019 however, it has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate because of objections to a new provision that prohibits perpetrators of domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Title IX. Another source of partisan conflict has been the Department of Educations changing guidance on Title IX investigations, which, as part of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment in education. In 2011, the Obama administration issued the Dear Colleague letter, which discouraged perpetrators from being able to personally cross-examine their accusers and lowered the evidentiary burden on the victim to match that of other student conduct cases. In 2017, the Trump administration reversed these changes. Table 5 Comparing the Candidates on Sexual Violence No stated position on campaign website. Rescinded Title IX Obama administration guidance aimed at protecting survivors of sexual assault on college campuses, permitting colleges to allow perpetrators to cross-examine their accusers and use a stricter standard of evidence for sexual assault cases than for all other student conduct cases including felony assault. Senator, was the original sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act VAWA, in effect from 1994-2018. Supports reauthorizing and expanding the law, including the provision that would prohibit perpetrators of domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Has several policy proposals to address violence against women, including protecting survivors of sexual assault from housing discrimination and guaranteeing paid safe leave to survivors who need time off work to address needs associated with domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Would work to reinstate the 2011 Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses. As Vice President, championed Its On Us, a campaign to end sexual violence on college campuses. Paid Leave While most U.S. workers have access to paid sick leave, few are offered paid family leave. Lower-wage and part-time workers are less likely to have access to these benefits than their counterparts. In the absence of a federal law, many states and localities have implemented their own paid leave programs. Paid leave has gained new urgency during the coronavirus pandemic as thousands of people have fallen ill with COVID-19 or have needed to take time off of work to care for an ill family member or a child whose school or day care has closed. To reduce the risk of having to take unpaid leave in these situations, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, passed in March 2020, provides short-term paid sick leave and longer-term, partially-paid family leave for absences related to coronavirus, through December 31, 2020. The law excludes the millions of workers at businesses with 500 or more employees. Table 6 Comparing the Candidates on Paid Leave Has called for some type of national paid parental leave and has allocated funds for it in his FY 2020 budget, but has not issued any formal proposal. Signaled his support for a 2019 Senate bill that would allow new parents to borrow from their future child tax credits while they took time off work, a different approach from most other paid family leave proposals. The bill has stalled. Signed legislation granting federal employees up to 12 weeks of job-protected paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child. Signed legislation that temporarily provides eligible workers with short-term paid sick leave and longer-term paid family leave for specified reasons related to coronavirus. Subsequently elected to exempt virtually all health care workers and emergency responders, as well as employees at firms with fewer than 50 employees, from some or all provisions of the law. Has proposed adopting the national paid family and medical leave program envisioned in the FAMILIES Act, which would guarantee workers up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave at partial pay for the birth or placement of a child or to care for family members with a serious illness. Has called for passage of the Healthy Families Act, which would allow workers to accrue and use up to seven job-protected days of paid sick leave per year. Supports expanding the coronavirus emergency paid sick and family leave benefits to include all workers regardless of industry, sector, or employer size, closing many of the gaps in the existing law. As Senator, voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 FMLA, which provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons. Conclusion There is much at stake for women in the 2020 presidential election and the candidates differences on womens health are stark. President Donald Trump has not released a conventional set of campaign policy proposals, but his record in office illustrates his priorities, which include supporting efforts to repeal the ACA, prioritizing the religious beliefs of employers, including their objections to contraception, and promulgating regulations that limit access to abortion. In contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden supports retaining and strengthening the ACA and expanding access to the full range of reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion. Regardless of the outcome, the 2020 election cycle has significant ramifications for the policy agenda that will shape womens health for years to come. EndnotesAlthough this brief focuses on domestic policy, the outcome of the 2020 election also has implications for global reproductive health issues, particularly as they relate to the Kemp-Kasten amendment and the Mexico City Policy.

Key Issues for Women’s Health:

	1.	Affordable Care Act (ACA):
	•	The ACA made important strides in improving women’s health care access, such as mandating maternity care and preventive services, and prohibiting gender-based discrimination in health plans. It also expanded Medicaid and offered financial subsidies for individuals buying coverage.
	•	Trump’s Position: He sought to repeal the ACA, signed legislation reducing the individual mandate penalty to zero, and supported a lawsuit to overturn it. His administration expanded short-term plans that lack many ACA protections.
	•	Biden’s Position: He supports strengthening the ACA, proposing a public option similar to Medicare, expanding subsidies, and automatically enrolling those in non-Medicaid expansion states.
	2.	Reproductive Health:
	•	Access to contraception and abortion has been a contentious issue, with the ACA requiring insurance coverage for contraception and the federal Title X program supporting reproductive health services for low-income individuals.
	•	Trump’s Position: He allowed exemptions for employers objecting to contraception coverage, defunded Title X clinics that provide abortion referrals, and sought to make the Hyde Amendment permanent, limiting federal abortion funding.
	•	Biden’s Position: He supports full contraception access, reversing Trump-era Title X changes, and codifying Roe v. Wade to protect abortion rights.
	3.	Abortion Access:
	•	Abortion access remained under scrutiny, especially with a conservative Supreme Court majority that could influence decisions on abortion-related cases.
	•	Trump’s Position: He opposes abortion, aims to overturn Roe v. Wade, and appointed anti-abortion judges. He reinstated the global gag rule and reduced abortion access through regulatory changes.
	•	Biden’s Position: He supports legal abortion, opposes the Hyde Amendment, and pledges to protect abortion rights through federal action.
	4.	Maternal Mortality:
	•	The U.S. faces a rising maternal mortality rate, especially among racial minorities and in rural areas. Proposals exist to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage and improve access to maternity care.
	•	Trump’s Position: He signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act and supported opioid misuse programs but had limited proposals on expanding Medicaid for maternal care.
	•	Biden’s Position: He advocates for Medicaid expansion, a public health option for uninsured women, and plans to address racial disparities in maternal health, inspired by California’s successful model.
	5.	Sexual Violence:
	•	Sexual violence, a significant health concern, is addressed by laws like the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Title IX protections for sexual assault survivors in education.
	•	Trump’s Position: His administration rescinded Title IX guidance that protected sexual assault survivors and supported policies that weakened VAWA.
	•	Biden’s Position: He supports reauthorizing and expanding VAWA, restoring Title IX protections, and tackling domestic violence and sexual assault more comprehensively.
	6.	Paid Leave:
	•	Paid leave policies gained importance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with few workers having access to paid family leave.
	•	Trump’s Position: He signed legislation providing short-term paid sick leave during the pandemic but exempted many workers.
	•	Biden’s Position: He supports national paid family and medical leave, proposes a paid leave program under the FAMILIES Act, and advocates for expanding pandemic-related paid leave benefits.

Conclusion:

The 2020 election highlighted stark differences between Trump and Biden on policies affecting women’s health. Trump’s record emphasizes deregulation and restrictions on reproductive health, while Biden supports expanding access to care, protecting abortion rights, and improving maternal and sexual violence protections. The election’s outcome would significantly shape the future of women’s health policy in the U.S."

It has been sent back to a parliamentary committee for further work.The proposed new restriction was proposed by an ultra-conservative Catholic group, under a regulation that allows citizens initiatives that gain more than 100,000 signatures to be debated.Parliament, dominated by the ruling Law and Justice PiS party, had a choice of rejecting the bill out of hand or fast-tracking it to a second reading, but on Thursday chose the middle-road option. In the past, this has been a way to let legislation quietly die, but it could still resurface.Previous attempts to impose a total abortion plan in the country had been tentatively supported by parts of PiS, but the government backed down after mass protests. This week, dozens of Polish women have protested in Warsaw despite a strict lockdown currently in place over coronavirus.President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, said earlier this month that killing disabled children is simply murder and promised he would sign the law if it reached him.

The bill, introduced by an ultra-conservative Catholic group, aims to ban abortions even in cases of serious fetal abnormalities, one of the few exceptions allowed under Poland’s already strict abortion laws. The bill has been sent back to a parliamentary committee for further review.

Poland currently has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, permitting abortion only in cases of rape, incest, risk to the mother’s life, or severe fetal abnormalities. If passed, the new bill would effectively eliminate almost all legal abortion in the country. President Andrzej Duda, aligned with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, has supported the proposal, calling the termination of disabled fetuses “murder” and promising to sign the bill into law if it passes.

In recent years, previous attempts to enforce stricter abortion laws have faced mass protests, which led to government backdowns. Despite this, a proposal to ban abortion was still introduced, sparking demonstrations, including some by women in Warsaw, despite the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown. Rights organizations both within Poland and globally have condemned the bill, urging parliament to reject it. In addition to the abortion proposal, another bill aimed at curbing sex education in schools has also been pushed to committee.

Amnesty International has pledged to monitor these bills closely to prevent their further progression."

These states have the highest rates of infant mortality, the lowest life expectancy, the lowest wages--and more. Illustration Oxfam Post Share The anti-choice movement labeled itself pro-life decades ago and rode that train all the way to the Supreme Court. As states furiously roll back rights to abortion and reproductive choice, we can see, with terrifying clarity, how that term is really a shield and the policymakers who hide behind it often implement policies that disempower and harm people. The recent decision from SCOTUS to dismantle federal protections around safe and legal access to abortion is part of a larger picture that strips women of reproductive freedom and bodily autonomy, and disempowers people that wealthy, powerful interests consider theirs to exploit.The Senate is populated largely by older White men many of whom owe their seats to corporate interests that seem intent on reducing working people to simple parts cheap labor and avid consumers. Without admitting their purpose, right-wing policy makers target those who are historically marginalizedlow-income single moms Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities LGBTQ and people with disabilitiesand deprive them of exactly what they need to take steps out of poverty.They refuse to raise the federal minimum wage, pass Build Back Better, pass the PRO Act, or mandate paid leave. They refuse to see and treat people who are struggling as fully human and fully deserving of a decent life.Which leaves it to the states. And now, at the state level, the gap between those that protect the rights and well-being of working people and those that dont is yawning wider every day.WHERE PRO-LIFE MEANS UNTIMELY DEATHIf you want to support and honor life, and families, and the dignity of work, you can do it. What people need is straightforward.Mandate living wages, paid leave sick, maternity, family, safe conditions, access to healthcare including the right to access safe and legal sexual and reproductive healthcare, robust public education, reasonable working schedules, and rights to stand up and organize.Low wages trap people in poverty, hunger, precarity refusing paid leave is dangerous to health and well-being round-the-clock, unpredictable schedules harm families in countless ways poor healthcare including and especially sexual and reproductive healthcare means higher maternal and infant mortality, and shorter life spans and blocking organizing and unionizing fractures and disempowers workers. What is pro-life about that?The maps that follow illustrate where people are being most effectively stripped of their rights. The result is a population that is splintered, and scrambling to find connection and power. And a wealthy class that is stepping in to take advantage of the moment to divide and disempower.Make no mistake It is on all of us, in every state, to demand federal standards for what is right, and what supports us as full human beings. And to stand in support of those in states where people are facing growing challenges to their well-being and survival.While these efforts will disproportionately impact those who have been historically marginalized, they establish the framework for a terrible reality for all of us. We must fight back.The map of abortion rightsWhile this map is changing daily at this point, it aligns with state laws and policies that have been waiting on the overturn of Roe v Wade. The southern and mountain states are moving quickly to make it a crime, and to shorten the period when abortion is allowed.This map does not stand alone. Consider how it overlaps with the maps that follow The states that require a woman to carry a pregnancy to term no matter the circumstances are precisely those that offer scant supports for her during the pregnancy, birth, recovery, and breastfeeding, and often even less for the baby and child. Source As of July 1, 2022. The map of workers rightsSince 2018, Oxfam has assessed and ranked US states based on laws and policies that impact people at work. Weve tracked how some states have stepped up to improve the lives of working families Theyve raised wages, improved working conditions, and extended rights. Meanwhile, others have taken steps to favor employers and corporations over workersfreezing wages at poverty levels, removing protections at work, and eliminating rights. Oxfam index of Best and Worst States to Work. Source The states that do worst by workersespecially working womenare for the most part the same states that are banning abortion and denying reproductive rights.For example, Mississippi is about to ban abortion, forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy to term. At the same time, Mississippi offers NO accommodations for pregnant or breastfeeding workers, no form of paid sick leave, maternity leave, or family leave no flexible scheduling of work shifts no protection from sexual harassment and the minimum wage is 7.25 the tipped wage is 2.13.At the other end of the spectrum, Oregon has protected rights to abortions and offers robust protections for workers the tipped wage is 12.75, and it offers all the protections noted abovefor pregnancy and breastfeeding, for paid leave, for notice of scheduling. And more.The map of low wages Oxfam map of low wages in the US. Source Not coincidentally, the map of low wages in the US largely aligns with the map of workers rights. Again, Mississippi falls near the bottom of the assessment 45 of workers earn less than 15 an hour 30,000 a year. More than half of all working women earn less than 15, and a full 70 of women of color earn less than 15.In other words, in a state where women have no choice about carrying a pregnancy to term, many are also facing low wages and grinding poverty, no matter how hard they work.The map of hungry childrenFood insecurity is directly related to household income, family size, and precarity and every time you chip away at the policies that support working families, you put more children at risk.In the four states around Mississippi, more than one in four children lives in a food-insecure household.A quarter of all children.

It all adds up.Map of infant mortality rates Source CDC, Infant mortality rates by state, 2020. And here it is What happens to actual babies when they are born.To be clear, this map and the maps on maternal mortality and life expectancy will only get more dismaying when abortion is outlawed. Poverty, food insecurity, and poor healthcare all exacerbate the burden on women forced to carry a pregnancy to term. All the problems will escalate.Map of the Black population of the US Source Kaiser Family Foundation, It should sound alarm bells to see how closely this map aligns with all the others.To be clear, Black people in all states earn lower wages, suffer higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, have shorter life expectancies, and face higher rates of food insecurity than White people. But to see this concurrence of geography with density of Black population illustrates even more the structural nature of racism in our country.The map of the human heartThese maps crack my heart a bit. This is my country. Those of us who live in the Blue states, where we enjoy legal protections on so many issues, are linked to people in Red states by very real threads. The loss of fundamental rights in one state impacts all of us. As one family, we are all injured.Moreover, there is such a deep disconnect between the laws and the will of the people. We the people are over here, living our lives as a noisy, energetic country, full of diverse people, religions, languages, businesses enjoying pop culture that celebrates love, sex, connection, dance, music, community feeding each other, organizing, lending a hand.But we have been outmaneuvered, and now are facing a world where five people have handed down a decision that will result in untold harm to women, children, and families.They seem to want to strip it of light and happiness. Who wants that world?Lets fight for life and fight for joy, for all of us, every day.

Babic argues that these states, which advocate against abortion, are simultaneously neglecting crucial social policies such as raising the minimum wage, providing paid leave, and ensuring healthcare access, which are essential for the well-being of families.

Babic highlights the contrast between states that ban abortion and those that provide better support for workers, showing that states with strict abortion laws also have some of the highest rates of infant mortality, low wages, poor healthcare, and shorter life expectancy. For example, Mississippi, which bans abortion, also has a minimum wage of $7.25, no paid sick leave or family leave, and inadequate healthcare systems, while Oregon, which protects abortion rights, offers better worker protections and higher wages.

The article argues that these policies disproportionately harm marginalized groups, including low-income single mothers, Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Babic also underscores how these factors, including food insecurity and maternal mortality, worsen when abortion rights are stripped away. She stresses that the loss of fundamental rights in one state impacts the entire country, urging people to fight for policies that support all families, especially those facing systemic barriers.

Ultimately, Babic calls for a more comprehensive definition of “pro-life,” one that encompasses the support for healthy, dignified lives beyond just the opposition to abortion. The article emphasizes that the well-being of individuals, particularly those in vulnerable communities, should be protected through policies that address poverty, healthcare, and workers’ rights."

Several weeks ago I had reported on my initial power draw investigation results covering the different display modes of the screen Much like on the Galaxy S20 series, the OnePlus 8 Pro incurs a large static power draw penalty when switching from 60Hz to 120Hz. This is a increase in the baseline power of the phone, no matter the type of content that youre displaying, and will even incur on a pure black screen. OnePlus 8 Pro Baseline Power usage Black Screen Whilst OnePlus does include refresh rate switching mechanisms based on scenarios such as video playback, the lack of a true variable refresh rate VRR mechanism that works on the per-frame basis and is implemented on the deeper OS and GPU driver levels, means that current generation high-refresh rate devices will have to suffer from a larger than usual power and battery life penalty. In our web browsing test, we see the clear impact of the 120Hz refresh rate on the OnePlus 8 Pro as it reduces the battery life of the phone in the test by 22 compared to its regular 60Hz mode. As a note- were testing at QHD resolution here as generally theres very little power benefit from using lower resolutions. In terms of absolute results, the 9.71h of the 120Hz mode here are adequate but not great. The results fall in line with the S20 at 120Hz, but short of the bigger battery capacity of the S20 Ultra. At 60Hz, the 8 Pro moves back in at 12.31h which is a great result and will get you through even the most extensive usage days. Whilst many will have looked forward to the OnePlus 8 Pro results, the really interesting results belong to the smaller OnePlus 8. The phone here was able to showcase outstanding battery life figures. The 90Hz mode only has an 8 impact on the battery runtime in this test, and in the 60Hz mode the phone lasted for a staggering 14h which is amongst the best results weve ever measured on a phone. In PCMark, the smaller OnePlus 8 again takes the lead in terms of longevity with its 60Hz mode. The 8 Pro also does quite well at 60Hz, and both phones lose respectively 15.4 and 16.4 of their runtime when switching over to 90Hz and 120Hz modes. Whilst the OnePlus 8 Pro pretty much fell in line with what weve expected in terms of its battery life, falling in line with the 120Hz power behaviour of the S20 phones, its the regular OnePlus 8 which surprised a lot given that it features a slightly smaller battery, notably surpassing the efficiency of the OnePlus 8 Pro. Given its form-factor and weight, its easily the longest-lasting device of its class, with only other heavier, bigger battery phones being comparable in terms of battery longevity.

I haven't seen any mention of it here.Thanks Andrei Frumusanu - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link I didn't have the problem on my device. MrPhilo - Tuesday, June 30, 2020 - link New update has increased minimum brightness so you would not see it anymore. Installing a custom kernel and changing the brightness to lowest you will see it. Flunk - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link Sure, if flagship means adding a bunch of pointless features and charging too much for the phone. I think reviewers failing to take value into account in reviews have to take at least some of the blame for these crazy phone prices.Oneplus' quest to make their products irrelevant has now met its totally forseen conclusion. BedfordTim - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link It would be nice to see a flagship camera in something like a P30 Lite. close - Tuesday, June 30, 2020 - link That's kind of what flagship means. Manufacturers bundle the best they have and when they run out of the good stuff they start bundling trinkets, bells, whistles, ribbons. And for most people buying the flagship isn't a matter of need but of want. They have the money, they want the image, even if many of the actual features are superfluous.I think what the title actually means is that OP started up by branding the devices as ""flagship killer"", the ""80 flagship at 20 of the price"" so to speak. With OP8 they are now ""just"" a flagship. As an OP owner I have a hard time justifying 700-1000E for this. That's not to say it's bad but it doesn't stand out of ""the pack"" overstatement, I know of Android flagships. pjcamp - Tuesday, June 30, 2020 - link I dunno. I see flagships subtracting options. You can't have expandable storage, you can't have a headphone jack, but you need to pay more to do without those things. s.yu - Wednesday, July 1, 2020 - link Couldn't agree more! Retycint - Thursday, July 2, 2020 - link Flagships were never meant to be good value-for-money. Not in the smartphone industry, not in the electronics industry, not ever. eastcoastpete - Monday, June 29, 2020 - link Thanks Andrei! I especially appreciate the section and detail on the video performance. However, that leaves me with a question so, which phone is currently the best for video? It seems that even the so-called flagship models all have significant problems one has artifacts, the next doesn't do a good job on stabilizing etc. So, which one is currently the leading candidate? 1 2 3 4 5 6 PIPELINE STORIES Submit News SK Hynix Starts Mass Production of HBM3E 9.2 GTs NVIDIA's 'cuLitho' Computational Lithography Adopted By TSMC and Synopsys For Production Use StarTech Unveils 15-in-1 Thunderbolt 4USB4 Dock with Quad Display Support Qualcomm Announces Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 A Cheaper Chip For Premium Phones BIOSTAR Debuts Barebones A620MS mATX Motherboard For Ryzen 7000 Processors First DNA Data Storage Specification Released First Step Towards Commercialization Asus Launches Low-Profile GeForce RTX 3050 6GB A Tiny Graphics Card for All PCs Asus Adds Support for 64GB Memory Modules to Intel 600700 Motherboards Western Digital Launches PC SN5000S SSD Low-Cost Meets High Performance NETGEAR Introduces WBE750 First Insight-Manageable Wi-Fi 7 Access Point Targets Congested Deployments Corsair Launches New XH405i Custom Water Cooling Kits And XG7 RTX 4080-Compatible Water Blocks ASML Delivers First 2nm-Generation Low-NA EUV Tool, the Twinscan NXE3800E LINKS About Forums RSS Pipeline News Bench Terms of Use Contact Us TOPICS SSDHDD Displays Mac Cloud Trade Shows FOLLOW Facebook Twitter The Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997 Advertising Privacy Policy Copyright 2024.

Key Battery Life Insights:

	•	OnePlus 8 Pro: The phone’s battery life is significantly affected by its 120Hz display. Switching to 120Hz incurs a large static power draw, even during simple tasks like displaying a black screen. In the web browsing test, battery life at 120Hz dropped by 22% compared to 60Hz, with the device lasting 9.71 hours at 120Hz and 12.31 hours at 60Hz. These results are adequate but not exceptional, aligning with the Galaxy S20’s 120Hz performance but falling short of the S20 Ultra’s larger battery capacity.
	•	OnePlus 8: The smaller OnePlus 8 performs exceptionally well in terms of battery life, outlasting the 8 Pro, despite having a smaller battery. At 60Hz, the OnePlus 8 lasts a staggering 14 hours, a result among the best in the industry. Even at 90Hz, battery life is only slightly impacted, with just an 8% reduction in runtime. In comparison, the OnePlus 8 Pro loses 15-16% of battery life when switching to 90Hz or 120Hz.

Overall Battery Performance:

While the OnePlus 8 Pro’s battery life is decent but not outstanding, the OnePlus 8 stands out as the more efficient device, offering exceptional longevity despite its smaller size and battery. Its efficiency surpasses that of the larger Pro model and competes well with other devices in its class, making it the longer-lasting phone in everyday use.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the OnePlus 8 Pro’s battery life is solid but not remarkable, especially when using the 120Hz refresh rate. In contrast, the OnePlus 8 excels with impressive endurance, especially in its 60Hz mode, making it one of the longest-lasting phones in its category."

What would my mother, and Jewish feminists of her generation, think? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Print Article Republish Article A pro-choice demonstration in New York in 1977. Image by Peter KeeganKeystoneGetty Images By Felicia Kornbluh March 5, 2020 Yesterday morning, I filed into the Supreme Court, took my seat, and watched history unfold I was there to observe the oral argument for the first big abortion case of the high Trump era June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo. This case has the potential, thanks to Trump appointees Neal Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to green-light harsh new restrictions on abortion access that would make the procedure virtually inaccessible to pregnant people in huge swaths of the country more inaccessible than it is right now. This case will not lead to an immediate revoking of the nearly half-century-old precedent that is Justice Blackmuns opinion in Roe v. Wade, but if the Supreme Court upholds the Louisiana statute at issue here, state-level politicians will be far more empowered than they already are to legislate major blocks to abortion access. As I sat there, trying to keep up with the constitutional back-and-forth while admiring the tenacity of the squad of New York female Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Ginsburg, I couldnt help but think of my mother, a tireless reproductive rights advocate based in New York City. What would she, and the Jewish feminists of her generation, think? Forwarding the News Thoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day. TermsRequired I agree to the Forward's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EmailRequired Indeed, what would my late mother, Beatrice Cogan Riedl Kornbluh Braun, pioneering Jewish woman lawyer and reproductive rights diehard, make of it all? Would she be shocked by the seemingly endless reversal of momentum in the feminist movement for reproductive rights, at least as it appears in opinions from the federal courts? Or would she find it par for the course, yet more evidence of the tenacity and brutality of sexism beyond the evidence of her mothers economic struggles as she raised four children on her own and my mothers own slog through a misogynist workplace and experiences of sexual victimization? My mother, who received her J.D. years before Justice Ginsburg more famously enrolled at a sexist Harvard Law School, was a passionate advocate for legal abortion. Throughout my childhood, whenever I raised the subject, she would say, with what I remember as clenched fists and a flushed face You dont understand, Felicia! They the illegal abortionists were butchers! Butchers! She played a role in the landmark decriminalization of the procedure in New York State that has been remembered by one of its architects as perhaps only a footnote in history, but one that should be read. The law Mom helped pass was a decriminalization of abortion in New York State through the twenty-forth week of a pregnancy. Her role was lobbying our local state Assemblyman, Austrian Jewish refugee Franz Leichter, who became the laws lead cosponsor. That law was far more than a footnote in history. By eliminating criminal sanctions for doctors and patients over such a long period, and imposing no residency requirement upon seekers of abortion procedures, New York became the most liberal abortion jurisdiction in the continental United States above the municipal level. Thanks to the law, pregnant people from across the country found their way to doctors in New York. Often, they were helped by the Clergy Consultation Service, a network of clergy members that included several Reform rabbis, who risked prosecution for their willingness to help patients locate safe and affordable procedures. The data from New York were unambiguous women from out of state arrived by the thousands. The cost of abortion declined. Maternal mortality dropped dramatically, especially for African American women. As Stanley Katz, a leading legal historian and alumnus of feminist battles in Illinois, said We all in the movement for decriminalization of abortion looked to New York as a leader in legislative reform, which they understood as the most promising approach to legal change. We never expected the Supreme Court to bail us out. My mother did not have much of a Jewish education, but her views on abortion mirrored those of most Reform and Conservative Jews in the U.S., and reflected what many authorities consider to be the Jewish legal position, with its roots in Exodus 2122 That the life of the fetus is less important than the life of the mother carrying it, and the fetus is something less than a full human. Countless times, my mother would interrupt conversations about healthcare with all three of her daughters with a warning to never go to a Catholic hospital! All they care about is the fetus, she railed. Never the mother! My mother was only one of a group of Jewish feminists who played vital roles in reproductive politics in the era just before and after Roe v. Wade. As I study reproductive politics in New York, I have found a rich history of Jewish feminist activism on the issue. Among fierce advocates for the decriminalization of abortion were Jewish liberal feminists such as National Organization for Women cofounder Betty Friedan and the leading attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU Harriet Pilpel. Ginsburg herself strongly favored legal abortion, although her ACLU Womens Rights Project did not litigate on decriminalization. Other leaders on the issue were so-called radical feminists who were more comfortable with public demonstrations than my mother was. These included writer Susan Brownmiller, pro-sex journalist Ellen Willis, and Ms. Magazine founder Gloria Steinem, who has dated her feminist awakening to a 1969 speak-out on abortion in support of decriminalization in New York. Distinct from the liberals and the radicals were socialist feminists, who worked in interracial groups for legal abortion and for a wider reproductive agenda women like attorneys Karen Stamm and Nancy Stearns, historian and novelist Meredith Tax, activist Sarah Schulman, political scientist Rosalind Pollack Petchesky, novelist Alix Kates Shulman, and historian Atina Grossman. It seems that Jewish women were overrepresented in reproductive rights everywhere in the U.S., even in places where their numbers werent as overwhelming as they were in New York. Why? Perhaps, like my mother, they learned or intuited a Jewish legal preference for the mothers life over that of the fetus. And perhaps they felt the immediacy of challenges to reproductive autonomy as a result of Nazism, an object lesson in what can happen when ideas about good and bad bodies, including reproductive bodies, are weaponized by an intrusive and powerful state. As the June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo case heads toward a resolution, I remember and honor all of these Jewish women activists and I hope their hard work was not for naught.

Russo. This case, which has the potential to introduce significant restrictions on abortion access, causes Kornbluh to consider the views of her late mother, Beatrice Cogan Riedl Kornbluh Braun, a passionate advocate for reproductive rights in New York City. Kornbluh remembers her mother’s fierce stance on legal abortion and her significant role in the decriminalization of abortion in New York State in the 1970s. The law she helped pass made New York the most liberal jurisdiction in the U.S. on abortion, with no residency requirement and the ability to obtain an abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy.

Kornbluh explores how her mother’s advocacy aligned with Jewish legal perspectives, which often prioritize the life of the mother over the fetus. This perspective reflects the broader Jewish community’s views, especially within the Reform and Conservative movements, and is rooted in Jewish texts such as Exodus 21:22. Kornbluh also notes that Jewish feminists were particularly influential in the movement for reproductive rights, with figures such as Betty Friedan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Gloria Steinem making significant contributions. Jewish women, according to Kornbluh, were often overrepresented in these efforts, possibly due to the community’s historical experiences with oppression and the lessons learned from the Holocaust.

Kornbluh’s reflections honor the activism of Jewish feminists and emphasize the critical role they played in securing reproductive rights, which continue to face challenges today, especially in the wake of shifting political landscapes and legal battles."

By April 14, 2023 2999 Share Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Telegram Babasaheb Ambedkar is one of the first feminist leaders and womens rights advocates in the country. I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved Babasaheb had said. Despite this, his feminist contributions are often ignored and denied. Even Indian Feminists often limit his work to the betterment of Dalit womens lives. This invisibalization of Ambedkar and his lifes work is symptomatic of upper caste feminist movements. Ambedkar is only called upon when upper-caste women speak to and of Dalit women, beyond that Babasahebs work in pushed to the margins. In his essay Castes in India Babasaheb outlines how endogamy was the essence of the caste system. He details how the focus on maintaining caste exclusivity leads to the rise of Sati and child marriage. He articulates through this piece the linkages between caste and the subordination of women. Ambedkar has always maintained that women were the gateways of the caste system and the caste system lay down a structure for the subordination of women and it had to be uprooted. He saw castes exclusionary violence and subjugation of women inherent to the very process that lead to caste formation. Ambedkar in his other works details the gendered violence that women face withing Hindu Smritis and Vedic texts. In the Manusmriti for example, Manu set the ideal for women to worship her husband despite all his flaws. He says Manu can hardly be said to be more tender to women than he was to the Shudra. I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved-B R Ambedkar Ambedkar did not only right for womens rights, he continuously worked with women to realize the ambition of equality amongst genders. He advocated for the rights of sex workers and spoke out against the casteist nature that was the foundation of sex-work. He worked to ensure that women were also protected under labour laws. He was instrumental in reducing the number of working hours and improving the working conditions. In 1928, as a member of the Legislative Council of Bombay, he supported a Bill granting paid maternity leave for women working in factories. He was of the view that if the employer was getting benefits off of womens labour, they should also be supporting women, partly, when they are on their maternity leave. The other half he believed should be paid by the government as it was in the interest of the nation. Ambedkar also believed that women have the right over their own body. He said that conception was a choice that women should make. He argued for reproductive rights for women, recommended that birth control facilities be made available to them, and was a strong advocate of womens reproductive freedom. Ambedkar Jayanti, Anand Teltumbde arrest and the casteist face of power He also drafted the Mines Maternity Benefit Act which asked for equal wages and equal representation of women on the welfare fund for the coal mine workers, and emphasised equal citizenship and womens right to economic development as crucial for womens rights in India. Between 1942 and 1946 he passed several progressive legislations for women that dealt with equal wages for equal work, casual and privilege leave, compensation in cases of injury, and pension. Hindu Code Bill Ambedkars antidote to Brahminical Patriarchy One of the biggest testaments to Ambedkars feminism was the Hindu Code Bill. Ambedkar was entrusted with drafting the Hindu Code Bill. This Bill was to codify property practices for men and women, design law of maintanence, marriage, divorce, adoption amongst other issues. Ambedkar used this as an opportunity to ensure women had full access to rights within the system. He included the issue of abolition of birth-right to property, property by survivorship, half share for daughters, conversion of womens limited estate into an absolute estate, abolition of caste in matters of marriage and adoption, and the principle of monogamy and divorce. Ambedkar stood by these issues in face of strong opposition from conservative Hindu men in the parliament. Image courtesy Nehru Memorial Library The focus of the bill was to give women absolute right over property, absence of endogamy, the access to divorce, and to relieve women of the threat of polygamy. The aim was to oppose the practices of Brahminical patriarchy and thus stop its reproduction. The Bill kept getting tabled in the parliament with promises to address it at a later point in time but this never happened. The house was well aware of the power of disruption that the bill possessed. It could shake the foundations of patriarchal control over production and reproduction. In despair, Ambedkar resigned. In his resignation speech Ambedkar said The Hindu Code was the greatest social reform measure ever undertaken by the legislature in this country. No law passed by the Indian legislature in the past or likely to be passed in the future can be compared to it in point of its significance. To leave inequality between class and class, between sex and sex, which is the soul of Hindu society, untouched and to go on passing legislation relating to economic problems is to make a farce of our Constitution and to build a palace on a dung heap. This is the significance I attached to the Hindu Code. It is for its sake that I stayed on, notwithstanding my differences. Movements headed by Ambedkar always had women walking side-by-side with the men. During the Mahad Satyagraha 10,000 men and women walked together to break the law on not allowing the Mahars to drink water. This was in contrast to Gandhis Salt Satyagrah, during which there were no women who were allowed to participate. In the Kalaram temple-entry movement Ambedkar inspired women to come out of their social arenas and speak with courage. In 1930, 15000 people came out to be part of this movement. Radhabai Vadale, who was one of the women who was moved by Babasahebs call, said, It is better to die a hundred times than to live a life of humiliation. This was a testament to the fact that Ambedkar had inspired confidence in women to fight for their rights. In an address to the All-India Depressed Classes Womens Conference he told women Give education to your children. Instill ambition in them Dont be in a hurry to marry marriage is a liability. You should not impose it upon children unless financially they are able to meet the liabilities arising from them. Above all let each girl who marries stand up to her husband, claim to be her husbands friend ad equal, and refuse to be his slave. This was telling of Ambedkars feminism and his push to ensure women were not enslaved to the patriarchal ideas as mapped in the Hindu religion. Ambedkar rallied for the rights to equal partnership in marriage well before Savarna feminists, who appropriated his call. Dr. Ambedkar started a newspaper called Mooknayak in January 1920. He started a biweekly called Bahishkrut Bharat in 1927, and both these newspapers regularly covered issues related to women and their rights. In a time where women were constantly pushed to the margins, Ambedkar worked to fight against this marginalization. While speaking to a gathering of Dalit women, Ambedkar has asked, What is the difference between children born to Kayasatha and other savarna women sitting in this meeting and us?You must think and realise that you have as much character and purity as a Brahman woman. In fact, the courage and will to act that you possess, even the Brahman woman lacks. Then why must children born to you, be insulted? Youve not given this a thought, or else you would have organized a Satyagrah Ambedkars ideas have helped feminists in India to understand that their struggle is incomplete without Dalit women. This introspection also made led womens movement more inclusive to the transgender people.

March 22, 2023 Krishna Janambhoomi Case Petition for ASI Examination of Mathura and Agra. April 15, 2021","Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is celebrated as a pioneering feminist in India, whose advocacy for women’s rights was revolutionary. He believed the advancement of society hinged on women’s progress, and his efforts extended beyond caste-based rights to challenge patriarchal structures embedded within Hindu religious practices and societal norms. Ambedkar highlighted endogamy as the cornerstone of the caste system, which perpetuated women’s oppression through practices like sati and child marriage. He argued that women were vital in upholding caste boundaries, which led to their subjugation, especially within Hindu scriptures and texts like the Manusmriti, which prescribed subservient roles for women.

Ambedkar actively worked to secure labor rights for women, including maternity benefits and improved working conditions. In 1928, he supported legislation in the Bombay Legislative Council advocating for paid maternity leave, emphasizing employer responsibility for women’s welfare. He also promoted women’s reproductive rights, arguing that women should have autonomy over their bodies, and he endorsed birth control access for women.

Ambedkar’s Hindu Code Bill was his most ambitious attempt to dismantle patriarchal control within Hindu law. The bill proposed revolutionary changes such as abolishing birth-right property practices, allowing divorce, ending caste restrictions on marriage, and protecting women’s property rights. Despite resistance and repeated delays by conservative Hindu factions in parliament, Ambedkar held that this bill was critical to achieving gender equality. Frustrated by the lack of progress, he eventually resigned, labeling the Hindu Code as a transformative social reform.

Ambedkar’s movements, like the Mahad Satyagraha and Kalaram Temple entry, included women as equal participants, contrasting with other leaders of the time who excluded women from activism. His speeches to women’s groups urged them to value education, delay marriage until financially stable, and reject subjugation. He encouraged women to stand as equal partners to their husbands, embodying his feminist ideals well before mainstream Indian feminism.

Through his newspaper initiatives, Mooknayak and Bahishkrut Bharat, Ambedkar amplified women’s issues, addressing the systemic marginalization they faced. His leadership not only empowered Dalit women but also challenged upper-caste feminist movements to be more inclusive of Dalit and transgender women’s rights.

In summary, Ambedkar’s feminism went beyond traditional frameworks, focusing on structural reforms and economic independence for women, making his contributions foundational to India’s feminist and social justice movements."

In the US, feminism is under attack from the right, the left, and from withincausing American feminists a triple bind. By Pardis Mahdavi Being a feminist anywhere in the world right now is a high-stakes endeavor. We are at a turning point in how we think about feminism, womanhood, and resistance. In the US, feminism is under attack from the right, the left, and from withincausing American feminists a triple bind. As has historically been the case, the conservative right attacks feminism by trying to incite a moral panic. Feminists are cast as scheming women tearing the fabric of family life by putting their careers and aspirations ahead of procreation or child-rearing, without a care for life as those in anti-abortion ranks would state. On the left, feminism has also come under scrutiny in the backlash to MeToo. Many on the left criticize feminists for going too far and, in so doing, undermining the causes of the left in presidential elections, for instance. Men on the left worry that their feminist counterparts are inciting a witch hunt, women on the left criticize other women for creating a moral panic around sexuality. And sadly, from within the feminist movement, the infighting has caused fracture, alienation, exile in January of 2019, the Womens Marches almost did not take place, and those that did were highly controversial. Feminist support of various male or female presidential candidates for the 2020 race further exemplifies this infighting, with some declaring that true feminists would only back a woman. While conflict within a movement is okay, expected even, feminists today are having trouble fighting and then staying in solidarity. What it means to be a true feminist is up for debate in the US, and it is undermining a decades-long cause just as we approach the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. Learning lessons from global feminism can help us think about the future of American feminism. While conflict within a movement is okay, expected even, feminists today are having trouble fighting and then staying in solidarity. Across the Atlantic, women are engaging in some of the same struggles as those of us here in the US. Transnational feminists are finding their feet through a sisterhood and friendship formed between the threads of activism and shared struggles. Through the essays provided here, we can see that feminist human rights activists worldwide are also experiencing a triple bind. These women are simultaneously fighting the state, their religions, and themselvesall as informed by patriarchy. Many women struggle with expectations of womanhood as couched within these battles. But there is much to be learned from the way that activists globally engage feminism. Notably, women in places like Iran, India, and Tunisia ground their feminism in solidarity at all costs. Perhaps this is in part because they participate in cultures that are less individualistic than the United States, but there is much to be learned from this unwavering sisterhood. Women like those I met in the Middle East and South Asia stand behind one another in ways that strengthen their movements, and when push comes to shove, they always choose the cause over themselves. The Indian case is noteworthywherein feminist activists focused on sexual assault came together with LGBTQ rights activists as well as sex workers rights groups. Harnessing a collective power allowed them to bring about major social change under one of Indias most conservative regimes. The feminists I have observed through decades of studying sexuality and gender rights in the Middle East and Asia highlight the power of coming together across siloes. With this solidarity comes a narrative, first borrowed from Western feminists, of feminism as family. Feminist activists talk about their activist communities as providing them family when they were exiled or felt disconnected from their own families. However, their narrative of family is not predicated on always agreeing with each other. How many families do you know that dont fight? That dont have conflict? Renu, a feminist rights activist from India asked me one day. Their deployment of the term family means a creating space that is safe enough to fight. They believe that internal conflict makes their familiesand their causebetter. And, like a family, they may fight within, but when it comes to turning to the outside world, they support one another. Another important component of the feminisms I have been researching in West Asia is the commitment to sharing the stage while calling for social change. For example, when movements such as Irans Green movement, a civil rights type movement borne of the youth and feminist movements in Iran, was taking shape, there was not one clear leader. The same could be said of the Arab Spring in Tunisia. In fact, when these movements were happening, American journalists often called me asking for specific names of leaders or iconic figures whom they could interview. These journalists were surprised that one or a handful of people could not be singled outlas this was a deliberate strategy to not get mired in the power dynamics of who holds the bullhorn. Coming together to share our struggles different and similar as they are is the best way to inspire the coming generations of feminists. The essays in this section provide a welcome opportunity for readers who are interested in feminist issues to explore a different kind of feminism, and the impact of that feminism on individuals lives across the globe. Through the stories presented here, we see how individual change can bring about systemic change and vice versa. Women from the global South have been glossed over as victims, people without agency, who need to be saved by American intervention. The remedy for this is a nuanced, story-driven look at activism by women in the global South. The authors in this section complicate this view. Feminism in America and elsewhere is trying to define itself, figure out what to do next in this era of social media and fake news. But we dont need to start all over. This is where the work of these authors comes in. By calling attention to the presence of a strong feminist- driven resistance around the world, and a resistance that is messy at times and requires the resilience that comes from the bonds of friendship, that can inspire readers globally and help us view feminism in a more nuanced way. This piece is part of a series published in partnership with Occidental Colleges Young Initiative on the Global Political Economy, the division of Social Sciences at Arizona State University, and USCs Institute on Inequalities in Global Health.

Right-wing critics often depict feminists as undermining family values, while some on the left argue that feminist movements, especially in the wake of #MeToo, harm progressive causes. Within the movement, ideological differences have also caused fractures, as seen in controversies surrounding the Women’s March and debates over which candidates feminists should support in elections.

Mahdavi suggests that American feminists could learn from global feminist movements, where solidarity often prevails despite ideological differences. Feminists in countries like India, Iran, and Tunisia have faced formidable societal, religious, and state pressures, yet they remain united, grounded in a “sisterhood” that prioritizes shared goals over individual disagreements. For instance, in India, feminist activists have collaborated across diverse groups, including LGBTQ and sex workers’ rights advocates, to challenge conservative policies successfully. This cross-movement solidarity contrasts with American feminism’s recent struggles to maintain unity.

Mahdavi also emphasizes the importance of a decentralized approach, where movements avoid elevating a single leader, thereby preventing power struggles that can detract from collective goals. This leaderless approach was seen in movements like Iran’s Green Movement and Tunisia’s Arab Spring. Additionally, Mahdavi observes how feminists from the global South view their activist communities as “families” that provide a safe space for internal debate and conflict. Despite their differences, these activists stand together against external challenges, a unity that Mahdavi suggests American feminists could adopt.

The article concludes that feminists worldwide have built resilient, inclusive movements that often succeed through their collective strength and resolve. This approach offers a model for American feminists who are struggling to define feminism’s next steps in an increasingly polarized environment. Rather than starting from scratch, U.S. feminists could be inspired by the “messy” yet resilient and bond-driven activism of global feminist movements, which balance internal conflicts with a strong sense of solidarity against common oppressors."

He used his speech to attack Democrats as embracing radical and extreme positions on abortion and praised those attending the event, saying they were motivated by pure, unselfish love. He also recited actions hes taken as president that were sought by social conservatives, including the confirmation of 187 federal judges. Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House, he declared. Trump once declared in a 1999 interview that I am pro-choice in every respect. Now, as he heads into the 2020 election, Trump continues to reach out to the white evangelical voters who have proven to be among his most loyal backers. Every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting, Trump said, prompting loud cheers from the many thousands attending the march. Trump is counting on the support of his base of conservative activists to help bring him across the finish line. I think its a brilliant move, said Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of Trumps most prominent evangelical supporters. Reed said the presidents appearance would energize and remind pro-life voters what a great friend this president and administration has been. It also shows how much times have changed. Past presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure. They sent remarks for others to deliver, spoke via telephone hookup or invited organizers to visit the White House. Over the last 10 years, however, the Republican Party has undergone a revolution, displaying a new willingness to embrace the issue as not only being morally right but politically smart, said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PAC. The group is planning to spend 52 million this cycle to help elect candidates opposed to abortion rights. Its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, will serve as national co-chair of a new campaign coalition, Pro-life Voices for Trump. According to Pew Research Center polling in 2019, roughly 6 in 10 Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Over time, though, both the Republican and Democratic parties have taken harder-line positions for and against abortion rights. There used to be a middle in this country and candidates would not want to alienate the middle, said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under President George W. Bush. And it just seems that that is over and that both parties play to their bases to get maximum turnout from their base. During his first three years in office, Trump has embraced socially conservative policies, particularly on the issue of abortion. Hes appointing judges who oppose abortion, cutting taxpayer funding for abortion services and painting Democrats who support abortion rights as extreme in their views. President Trump has done more for the pro-life community than any other president, so it is fitting that he would be the first president in history to attend the March for Life on the National Mall, said White House spokesman Judd Deere. This is not the first time Trump has given serious consideration to an appearance. Last year, he wanted to go and came close to attending, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. But the trip never came together because of concerns about security so Trump joined the event via video satellite from the White House Rose Garden instead. Trumps thinking on the matter was simple If he supported the cause, why wouldnt he show up to their big event? said Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union and a close ally of the White House. He said the appearance would be deeply significant for those in participants. Ive had people be moved to tears over the fact that hes going, said Schlapp. Its a big deal. During his video address last year, Trump sent a clear message to the thousands of people braving the cold on the National Mall. As president, I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence, the right to life, he said. The rhetoric underscored Trumps dramatic evolution on the issue from his days as a freewheeling New York deal-maker, when he described himself as very pro-choice in a 1999 interview on NBCs Meet the Press. During his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination, Trump said his views had changed and that he was now opposed to abortion, but for three exceptions In the case of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. Yet Trumps unfamiliarity with the language of abortion activism was clear, including when he offered a bungled response during a televised town hall and was forced to clarify his position on abortion three times in a single day. Asked, hypothetically, what would happen if abortion were outlawed, Trump said there would have to be some form of punishment for women who have them, prompting a backlash that managed to unite abortion rights activists and opponents, including organizers of the March for Life. Asked to clarify his position, Trumps campaign initially issued a statement saying he believed the issue should rest with state governments. He later issued a second statement that said doctors, not women, should be punished for illegal abortions. Critics, for their part, accuse Trump of using the march to try to distract from his impeachment trial in the Senate. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called it an act of desperation, plain and simple. Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, accused Trump of carrying out a full-out assault on our health and our rights. Views of abortion have remained relatively stable over two decades of polling, and its a minority of Americans who hold extreme opinions that abortion should be legal or illegal in all cases. But polling does suggest a widening partisan gap on the question of support for abortion rights in all or most cases, along with some movement on both sides of the aisle further into their extreme positions. The first march took place on the west steps of the Capitol in January 1974, the year after the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that established a womans legal right to abortion. Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report from Washington.

Support for NewsHour Provided By","In January 2020, President Donald Trump made history as the first sitting U.S. president to attend the annual anti-abortion March for Life rally in Washington, D.C. His presence underscored his appeal to conservative, particularly evangelical, voters ahead of the 2020 election. Trump, who previously identified as pro-choice in a 1999 interview, highlighted his administration’s support for anti-abortion policies, including the appointment of 187 federal judges favored by social conservatives. In his speech, he praised the attendees for their dedication and described the pro-life movement as motivated by “pure, unselfish love.”

Trump’s appearance marked a significant shift in the Republican Party’s approach to abortion. While previous Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush avoided personally attending the rally, Trump’s administration embraced the issue more directly, a move that his supporters argue energizes the conservative base. Ralph Reed, leader of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, expressed that Trump’s participation demonstrated his commitment to pro-life values, which he believed would galvanize voters. Mallory Quigley from the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, also noted that the GOP has grown more assertive on this issue, viewing it as both morally and politically advantageous.

Polling by the Pew Research Center in 2019 indicated that about 60% of Americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases. However, both major political parties have taken increasingly polarized stances, shifting further toward their respective ideological bases and leaving little room for centrist views. Trump’s appearance at the rally aligned with his broader strategy to secure loyalty from conservative activists and evangelical supporters, who are essential to his re-election campaign.

Trump’s attendance at the March for Life came during his Senate impeachment trial, which critics argued was an attempt to divert attention from the proceedings. Leaders from pro-choice organizations, including NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, criticized Trump’s stance, accusing him of undermining women’s health and rights.

Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, abortion has remained one of the most divisive issues in American politics, with the March for Life held annually to protest the ruling. Although views on abortion have been relatively consistent over the years, recent polling highlights a growing partisan divide, with each party increasingly adopting extreme positions on either side of the debate."

But, they have said, the doctors could not perform an abortion because of their interpretation of a Florida law that took effect after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade.Potter syndrome is a rare condition related to a fetuss development in the uterus. The syndrome is a result of abnormal kidney growth and function, which affects how much amniotic fluid surrounds the fetus during pregnancy.It has been deemed a doubly lethal diagnosis because babies with malfunctioning kidneys cant remove deadly toxins from their bodies and can in turn experience renal failure. Additionally, the absence of amniotic fluid in a womb causes a baby to be born without the ability to breathe.According to Floridas Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality law, which was implemented last July, abortions are prohibited after 15 weeks of gestation, with a few exceptions, including one that would allow for a later abortion if two physicians certify in writing that the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality and has not reached viability.The rogue Trump-appointed judge with abortion pills future in his handsRead moreLast November, when the couples baby was diagnosed with the syndrome, a maternal fetal medicine specialist told the Dorberts that some parents choose to continue to full term while others opt to terminate the pregnancy through surgery or preterm labor.The doctor added that he would consult with health system administrators regarding the new law, the Washington Post reports. The Dorberts eventually decided that they would like to terminate the pregnancy as early as they could because babies with the syndrome often die before they are born or end up suffocating within minutes or hours after their delivery.Deborah Dorbert told the outlet that she recalled the specialist saying that the termination might be possible but not until between 28 and 32 weeks.Then, after the specialist consulted with health system administrators regarding the new law, the couple was told that they would have to wait to terminate the pregnancy until the 37th week of gestation or near full term.According to a text message Deborah Dorbert received from the coordinator at a maternal fetal medicine office that she visits often, the specialist made his determination after having legal administrators look at the new law and the way its written, the Washington Post reported.Its horribly written, the message added.Despite the specialist telling the couple that other states had fewer restrictions on abortion access, the Dorberts told the Post that they were overwhelmed by travel costs and had only left their state a few times.The couple, who have not learned the babys sex because its legs were crossed or the umbilical cord was in the way during each scan, eventually opted to provide palliative care to their child after the baby is born.Thats been very important to us, understanding that we do have that control back at least in some of these decisions, Lee Dorbert told the Washington Post.Nevertheless, the new law which punishes physicians who violate it with penalties including license revocation, hefty fines and five years or more of jail time has left the couple angry and frustrated.It makes me angry, for politicians to decide whats best for my health, Deborah Dorbert told the Washington Post. We would do anything to have this baby.We have never really understood, Lee Dorbert said, adding We were told there was an exception Obviously, its not enough of an exception in some cases.Despite the pain that the Dorberts and couples in similar situations are experiencing, the states Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has maintained a staunch anti-abortion stance.Earlier this month, DeSantis said that he would sign a six-week abortion ban if one passed.Were for pro-life, DeSantis said. I urge the legislature to work, produce good stuff, and we will sign.

All rights reserved. dcr","A Florida couple, Deborah and Lee Dorbert, are facing a heartbreaking situation as they prepare for the birth of a child diagnosed with Potter syndrome, a fatal fetal condition. This diagnosis means that their baby, due to malformed kidneys, will lack amniotic fluid essential for lung development, leading to near-certain death shortly after birth.

Due to Florida’s restrictive abortion laws, which ban abortions after 15 weeks with limited exceptions, the Dorberts were denied a termination option. The law mandates that two physicians certify a fatal fetal abnormality for a later abortion, but the interpretation of this provision led to complications. The couple’s doctor consulted administrators and ultimately concluded that an abortion could only be considered after 37 weeks, close to full term.

The Dorberts, after learning about the costs and complexities of seeking abortion in another state, decided to provide palliative care after birth, accepting that their baby will likely not survive long. The situation has left them deeply frustrated with the political decisions affecting their healthcare, particularly under Governor Ron DeSantis’s administration, which supports restrictive abortion policies and is pushing for a potential six-week abortion ban.

The case has highlighted the emotional and logistical challenges faced by individuals restricted from seeking medical procedures due to recent abortion law changes in the United States."

A woman supporting abortion rights reacts to an anti-abortion protest outside the South Carolina Statehouse in July 2022. Meg KinnardAP As statehouses prepare for next years legislative sessions most for the first time since Roe v. Wade was overturned Republican lawmakers are pushing for further restrictions on reproductive health. Health Reporter Published 2022-12-05 0731 731 December 5, 2022 am Share Twitter Facebook As statehouses across the country prepare for next years legislative sessions most for the first time since Roe v. Wade was overturned Republican lawmakers are pushing for further restrictions on reproductive health, even in states where abortion is already banned. But fissures are already emerging. Now, anti-abortion lawmakers must decide if they will push new abortion bans a subject of debate among some abortion opponents if they will amend existing bans to allow for abortions in cases of rape or incest, or if they will move to other reproductive health issues such as contraception. Abortion opponents have struggled to agree on all of them, especially with total abortion bans proving unpopular among voters. We will see this split in the Republican Party around following essentially their base, which wants to ban abortion without any exceptions, and the larger public, said Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute. Near-total abortion bans are in effect in 13 states, and others have limited access In Georgia, the procedure is banned for people later than six weeks of pregnancy, and in Florida and Arizona, it is banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Bans in seven other states have been temporarily blocked but could take effect pending state court rulings. With Republicans controlling the U.S. House, federal abortion legislation whether a ban or national protection is unlikely to pass. State legislatures are the likeliest source of new abortion policy, and most work only part-time, meeting to consider bills for a few months either every year or every other year. The legislative year typically starts in January, but lawmakers are starting to prefile bills, offering a first glimpse into what they hope to accomplish next year. Watching the state lines Two bills in Texas, one of the few states that has bills prefiled, show how legislation could prevent people from leaving the state to access abortion. Republican lawmakers have put forth a bill that would prohibit government entities from giving someone money that might be used to travel out of state for an abortion. Another bill would eliminate state tax breaks for businesses in the state that help cover their employees travel costs associated with getting an abortion outside of the state. Sign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily Submitting Though no other states have similar bills yet, those could, if passed, offer a model for other states seeking to restrict abortion access further without directly banning interstate travel. Texas has already banned abortion completely, and it was the first state to eliminate access to abortions after six weeks, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned. In Missouri which, prior to Roes overturn had some of the most restrictive abortion policies in the country lawmakers have begun to pre-file bills intended to keep people from accessing abortion. The procedure is already banned there, but no state law prevents people from getting medication abortion pills from another state, or from traveling out of state for an abortion. If passed, these bills could change that. One would make it a felony to transport drugs that are intended to be used to induce an abortion, though the bill would not criminalize pregnant people. Similar legislation last year did not pass. Another bill would treat a fetus as a person legislation that could effectively equate abortion with murder. Both could pass this session, Nash said, though its hard to tell what abortion bills lawmakers will prioritize until they come back to the capitol. Emergency contraception access In states with abortion bans in place, some lawmakers and lobbyists, notably in Idaho and Missouri, have expressed interest in limiting access to some forms of emergency contraception such as Plan B. Major anti-abortion groups, such as Students for Life and several state-based chapters of the Right to Life organization, also oppose the so-called morning-after pill. But its not clear if those types of restrictions will gain traction at least immediately. In a recording obtained by ProPublica of a meeting between anti-abortion organizations and Tennessee lawmakers, some abortion opponents suggested legislators hold off on passing contraception regulations for at least a few years, until outrage over state abortion bans had abated. The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion lobbying group, will be working closely with state legislatures on a handful of issues this year, said state policy director Katie Glenn. Glenn, one of the people present at that meeting, told The 19th that Plan B restrictions are not something she has heard as a mainstream Republican or pro-life view. Anti-abortion protesters attend a rally for reproductive rights at the Texas Capitol in May 2022. Montinique MonroeGetty Images Further restrictions In some states where abortion is not yet banned including Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida there will likely be renewed discussion over further limiting when in pregnancy people can get abortions. In all four states, Republicans control the legislatures, though North Carolinas Democratic governor could veto some proposed restrictions. A year ago, Roe v. Wade was very limiting and now were going to have a lot more of a conversation about where states want their laws to end up, Glenn said. Florida legislators have already said they intend to pass a new abortion ban this year, though its not yet clear how early in pregnancy they will limit the procedure. In South Carolina, whose six-week ban has been blocked by state courts, legislators came to an impasse this summer over the details of their proposed near-total abortion ban specifically whether to include exceptions for people pregnant because of rape or incest. In practice, such exceptions dont actually work. Still, laws without any exception whatsoever have proven to be exceptionally unpopular with voters. This is the split in the party that is creating a problem for them. They cant get their people in line, Nash said. Is that going to continue? Or are people going to essentially get beaten into submission by leadership or the governor? Beyond gestational limits, the Susan B. Anthony List also intends to focus on curtailing access to medication abortions, the two-drug regimen used to terminate a first-trimester pregnancy. In states where abortion remains legal, that could mean laws banning people from getting medication abortions through telemedicine, in which pills are sent through the mail and a patient consults with a medical provider virtually. The practice is endorsed by medical experts as well as the Food and Drug Administration and World Health Organization. Medication abortions are the most commonly used method for people seeking to end a pregnancy. Pills taken from home can be easier to manage than traveling out of state for an abortion, which can cost hundreds of dollars and require time off work, explaining ones absence to friends and family and setting up days worth of child care often insurmountable barriers for people seeking to terminate a pregnancy. Medication abortions have also become far more prevalent in states where abortion is illegal people in Texas have been able to acquire medication from Mexico, and research shows that people across the country living in states with abortion bans have had the pills mailed from European health care providers. Abortion opponents are also seeking a way to limit peoples ability to get those pills, particularly by leaning on state law enforcement to block access to medication abortions. But its not yet clear how they might do that, or what kinds of laws state legislators might pass. Criminalization of abortion Last spring, Louisiana lawmakers debated whether to pass a law treating abortion as murder, a definition that would have criminalized people who get abortions. But that bill failed to gain traction, and its not clear if anti-abortion lawmakers will pursue similar legislation this year. Abortion bans typically do not directly punish the pregnant person, and only a handful of states have laws explicitly penalizing people who acquire an abortion outside the medical system. Theyre going to try to put some kind of guardrails to limit access to care, some kind of penalty, Nash said. I dont know if it would be treating abortion as murder versus something else that might be more palatable. Recommended for you State lawmakers prepare for a future without Roe v.

Events Jobs About Us Community Guidelines Membership Membership FAQ Ways to Give Sponsorship Privacy Instagram","Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led state legislatures are moving to introduce new restrictions on abortion and other reproductive health services, even in states where abortion is already banned. These efforts reveal internal divisions among anti-abortion advocates, who are split on how restrictive these policies should be.

Key strategies in states like Texas and Missouri include targeting out-of-state abortion access and limiting emergency contraception. Texas, for example, has proposed bills that would penalize state funds used for out-of-state abortions and remove tax breaks for businesses that support employees’ abortion-related travel. Missouri lawmakers are also pushing for laws that could restrict access to abortion medication across state lines, highlighting a focus on controlling abortion access beyond state borders.

Emergency contraception is another focus area, with some states considering limits on access to Plan B (the “morning-after pill”). However, not all anti-abortion leaders are on board with this; some suggest waiting until the current wave of public opposition to abortion bans subsides. High-profile groups like the Susan B. Anthony List have indicated that while they will push for tighter regulations on medication abortion, such as restricting telemedicine access, Plan B restrictions are not a priority for them.

The next legislative sessions may also bring renewed attempts in states like Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida to enact stricter abortion bans, with many targeting the stage of pregnancy when abortion is permitted. Lawmakers in Florida have already indicated their intention to propose a more restrictive ban. In South Carolina, legislators remain divided over whether to include exceptions for rape and incest, which complicates consensus on proposed laws.

Abortion opponents are also exploring ways to curb access to medication abortion in states where it is still legal, such as banning telemedicine consultations and mailing of abortion pills. Given that medication abortion is the most commonly used method and is supported by medical authorities as safe, any restrictions here would likely be controversial.

Some lawmakers have previously considered bills equating abortion with murder, which would criminalize individuals seeking abortions. While such extreme measures have not gained widespread support, there is interest among anti-abortion advocates in introducing some form of legal penalties for those involved in abortion procedures, although it remains unclear what form these penalties might take.

As states continue these legislative efforts, Republicans are expected to face growing internal challenges balancing restrictive policies with public opinion, which has shown resistance to strict abortion bans without exceptions."

Rape and incest are one of the abortion lobbys favorite arguments in defense of killing children. If they could get consensus around killing children based on how they were conceived, they could start breaking down opposition to other elective abortions and they did. But thats over now, as the Los Angeles Times reports Students for Life of America SFLA led the charge to protect children no matter what happened on the night they were brought into existence. In the article entitled Rape Exceptions to Abortion Bans Were Once Widely Accepted. No More, Los Angeles Times writer Jennifer Haberkorn highlights SFLA for being largely responsible for refusing to accept rape and incest exceptions and thereby transforming the wider movement. Haberkorn begins her analysis with an Alabama pro-life law from 2019 which was unique at the time for its lack of rape and incest exceptions. She writes, Alabamas law benefited from the support of an emerging and growing contingent of abortion opponents who positioned themselves outside a movement long dominated by groups such as the National Right to Life, the nations oldest antiabortion group. These abortion opponents were younger, more fervent in their position and less beholden to long-standing ideas about the need for political expediency. If abortion is wrong, they asked, why should it ever be allowed? Chief among these activists was Students for Life, a group made up of students who urged the Republican National Committee in a well-circulated letter to drop the rape and incest exceptions. SFLA opposes rape and incest exceptions because we understand that a child is no less worthy of life based upon how they were conceived. SFLA and Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins put it best when she said, Your humanity doesnt change with the circumstances of your conception. You are valuable regardless of how you came into existence, or what your father did the night of your conception. Hawkins was outspoken about how rape and incest exceptions are illogical and dehumanizing way before this view was considered politically achievable. In 2014, she wrote an enlightening and informative op-ed for The Hill entitled, What About Rape? in which she condemned pro-life politicians for skirting the issue and putting the pro-life movements credibility in jeopardy. Hawkins further explained how true pro-lifers should view rape and incest exceptions, writing, While the intention may be to ease her suffering, abortion, even in the case of rape, is a great injustice to the second victim, the baby, because he or she did not choose to be placed in this situation, either. Ultimately, we will ask the question If both victims of this tragic situation can walk away with their lives intact, isnt that the best option? In 2014, this was not a view that was widely accepted by the pro-life movement at large, and experts say that SFLA was a turning point for the movement. Haberkorn quoted Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University College of Law professor who specializes in the history of reproductive rights, as saying, Groups like Students for Life were embracing positions that the mainstream antiabortion movement wouldnt have, at least as openly. According to Ziegler, this transformation of the pro-life movement was a sort of mutiny against the antiabortion incrementalism that had been dominant for decades. Haberkorn continued, Support from groups like Students for Life helped give political life to more stringent abortion bans once viewed as politically impossible. SFLA will continue to unapologetically lead the way in lobbying and demanding pro-life action which stays true to the mission of pro-life movement the complete abolition of abortion. Unlike the abortion lobby, we will never define someones worth based upon the events that led to their conception, and we will always fight for all babiesnot matter how they were conceived.

Historically, many in the pro-life movement accepted these exceptions, which allowed for abortions in cases of rape and incest. However, SFLA argues that these exceptions undermine the pro-life stance by implying that some lives are less valuable based on the circumstances of conception. The group contends that this distinction is dehumanizing and ultimately harmful to the pro-life cause.

The article notes that SFLA has been instrumental in shifting the broader pro-life movement away from these exceptions. This shift began with a 2019 Alabama law that excluded rape and incest exceptions, supported by a growing number of younger, more radical pro-life advocates. The Los Angeles Times highlighted SFLA’s role in pushing this approach, framing it as a departure from the long-standing political pragmatism of established pro-life organizations like the National Right to Life. According to historian Mary Ziegler, SFLA’s influence represented a break from incremental strategies traditionally used in anti-abortion advocacy.

Kristan Hawkins, President of SFLA, has been a prominent voice against these exceptions, arguing that humanity and moral worth are inherent regardless of how one is conceived. She believes that pro-life values should consistently affirm the worth of all unborn lives. Hawkins and SFLA continue to campaign against rape and incest exceptions, advocating for comprehensive abortion bans without exceptions as the logical extension of their pro-life principles.

SFLA remains committed to leading this movement, asserting that the pro-life mission should be the absolute abolition of abortion without compromising for cases of rape or incest."
How Will Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs Confirmation to the Supreme Court Impact Public Health? | BU Today | Boston University,"How Will Amy Coney Barretts Confirmation to the Supreme Court Impact Public Health? BU Today Boston University Skip to Main Content Boston University More Publications University Publications Bostonia BU Today The Brink Other Publications Sections Search News, Opinion, Community How Will Amy Coney Barretts Confirmation to the Supreme Court Impact Public Health? Judge Amy Coney Barrett taking the oath of office following her confirmation to the US Supreme Court by the US Senate. Administering the oath is US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as Barretts husband and President Donald Trump look on. AP PhotoAlex Brandon Public Health Two School of Public Health experts weigh in on what to expect October 30, 2020 2 Michelle Samuels Twitter Facebook On October 26, Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative appeals court judge, was confirmed as the 115th justice to the US Supreme Court by the US Senate, the first justice in history to be confirmed just days before a presidential election. She fills the vacancy created by the death on September 18 of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a progressive who championed reproductive, LGBTQ, and womens rights. View Article Barretts confirmation followed a bitterly fought Senate hearing. The final vote, 52 to 48, was strictly along partisan lines, with only one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, siding with Democrats to cast a no vote. Democrats had argued that appointing a successor to Ginsburg be postponed until after Election Day and noted that the appointment was hypocritical of a Republican-controlled Senate that had blocked President Obamas nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, for several months in 2016 on the grounds that a Supreme Court seat should not be filled in a presidential election year. Barretts appointment now secures a 6-3 conservative majority on the court, presumably for years to come, something that has alarmed civil rights, voting rights, and public health advocates, among others, but that conservatives have hailed as a victory. To find out what impact Barrett could have on the future of public health in the United Statesincluding reproductive health and the future of the Affordable Care Act also known as ObamacareBU Today reached out to two School of Public Health faculty, Nicole Huberfeld, a professor of health law, ethics, and human rights, and Wendy Mariner, Edward R. Utley Professor of Health Law, Ethics, and Human Rights both are also School of Law professors. QAWith With Nicole Huberfeld and Wendy Mariner BU Today How do you see Amy Coney Barretts appointment changing the US Supreme Court? Mariner The installation of Amy Coney Barrett on the United States Supreme Court furthers a long-standing goal of those seeking to cement partisan minority rule in our institutions of government. It is deeply troubling that the federal judiciary can be seen as just another political branch, instead of the independent protector of democracy and the rule of law. Huberfeld The newly sealed conservative majority on the Supreme Court, as well as more than 200 other federal judicial appointments filled by President Trump, both thanks in part to Senator Mitch McConnell R-Ky. impeding the Senates appointment process during the Obama administration, will shape the way federal courts handle matters related to public health and the rights of vulnerable populations for years to come. BU Today How do you expect that Barretts presence on the court will affect public health? Mariner The new majority of privileged, conservative Supreme Court justices are unlikely to appreciate how laws force so many Americans to struggle to survive with subsistence wages, job loss, inadequate education, lack of healthcare, obstacles to voting, and discrimination in so many facets of life. All the social determinants of health are at risk. Huberfeld Decisions protecting equal rights will hang in a new balance, such as the Obergefell decision, which held that the right to marry includes same-sex marriage. Fundamental rights such as the right to privacy, which protects reproductive care and decision-making such as access to contraception and abortion, will almost certainly face new challenges very soon. Many states already have laws on the books that defy the current privacy framework created by cases such as Roe v. Wade and Casey by limiting the time that women can obtain an abortion, extending waiting periods, and other recent limitations, such as preventing access to abortion during COVID-19. Justice Barrett refused to answer questions about these rights during her Senate confirmation hearings, but she was vetted by conservative think tanks, which offers some insight into her jurisprudential viewpoint. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Other issues affecting underlying determinants of health, such as environmental protection and the stability of the Affordable Care Act, also hang in the balance. The court will hear oral arguments in Texas v. California on November 10, which means Justice Barrett will help to determine the fate of the ACA and thus health insurance coverage for more than 20 million Americans. It seems unlikely that the entire ACA will be struck down, but ACA decisions have been unpredictable. BU Today Given the courts new composition, what do you see as the way forward for public health advocacy? Huberfeld Some think that court packing adding more justices is the answer to concerns about the direction of the Supreme Court. This could occur by an act of Congress, but it does not guarantee that justices of any particular persuasion would be appointed and it could jeopardize the institutional legitimacy of the court even more than the speedy appointment of Barrett has done. The work to be done in public health is the effort of advocating for legislation that protects both collective and individual health. COVID-19 has highlighted the need for better centralized decision-making, the importance of robust federal funding to support individuals, businesses, and states in an emergency, and the need to collect better data to understand the deep roots and ongoing impacts of health inequities. Better foundational health will support all populations more equitably when the next emergency hits. These kinds of actions are the work of policymaking, and they can continue regardless of changes to the Supreme Court. Mariner There is always reason for hope, especially now, with more people actively participating in our democratic process. The United States has survived past challenges, rejected fear, and emerged more determined to make a more perfect union. I have faith in the great melting pot of America. Our voices cannot be ignored, despite gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics. We can work together, particularly at the state and local levels, to guarantee access to healthcare and all the necessities of life that make true freedom possible.

Web October 30, 2020 at 841 am It is so tiring to see yet more hand-wringing hyperbole from the left regarding the composition of SCOTUS. If you actually believe in the Constitution and our Constitutional Republic, then populating the court with Originalists or Textualists should be exactly what you should most desire. Seeing the court as partisan minority rule is simply projection by those who wish it to be so. The Court exists as a firewall to defend the Republic and the rights of the minority against majoritarianism. It does not exist to promote any sides agenda, even if they happen to be in the majority at any given time. The problem here is Progressives wish the Court to be proactive and shortcut the other two branches of government to provide outcomes they desire. When the legislature is ineffective, they wish for a partisan Court to deliver what the Congress can or will not. If the ACA is struck down by SCOTUS it will be because the law is unconstitutional, not because the laws intent or result is necessarily bad for the country. It is up to the Congress to craft legislation that works within the bounds of the Constitution or amend it. Reply Link L October 30, 2020 at 940 am Progressives like myself, believe that every human being deserves their rights to not be expandable. If everyone is to be protected equally under the laws, as our Constitution states, people who identify as LGBTQ, BIPOC, and many other groups of people should not be fearful for their lives right now. Everyone should have the right to a minimum standard of health, no matter how much money you have. This population of the Supreme Court is direct hypocrisy and is a tactic to remove fundamental rights from certain groups of human beings, which is inexcusable. Defending the Republic would mean defending all people that live in that Republic. Yes we are proactive, we want less suffering for all human beings, but there is nothing about us that is asking for shortcuts. Post a comment. Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email. share this","The Boston University article discusses the potential impact of Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court on public health and civil rights, focusing on concerns from public health experts. Barrett’s appointment strengthens a conservative majority (6-3) on the Court, raising questions about the future of key issues like reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ protections, and healthcare access, especially under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Key Points of Discussion:
	1.	Political Context and Confirmation Concerns: Barrett’s confirmation followed a contentious Senate process, with Democrats arguing for a delay until after the presidential election. Her appointment solidified a conservative majority, which civil rights and public health advocates worry could jeopardize established rights and protections.
	2.	Impact on Public Health and Social Determinants: Public health professors Nicole Huberfeld and Wendy Mariner from Boston University express concerns that the new Court may not prioritize the struggles of vulnerable populations. They highlight risks to rights affecting social determinants of health, including access to affordable healthcare, environmental protections, and safeguards against discrimination.
	3.	Reproductive Rights and LGBTQ+ Protections: Experts expect renewed challenges to reproductive rights (such as abortion and contraception access) and LGBTQ+ protections, given Barrett’s conservative background and reluctance to address these topics during her confirmation hearings. There are concerns that prior landmark rulings, like Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges (which legalized same-sex marriage), may be reconsidered.
	4.	Affordable Care Act (ACA): Barrett’s confirmation also brings uncertainty to the ACA’s future. The Supreme Court was set to hear arguments in Texas v. California, a case challenging the ACA, shortly after her appointment. Striking down the ACA could leave millions without health coverage, though experts find it unlikely that the entire law will be repealed.
	5.	Path Forward for Public Health Advocacy: Given the Court’s conservative tilt, public health experts recommend focusing on legislative advocacy at local and state levels to protect healthcare access and equity. They acknowledge court-packing as a possible, though controversial, strategy to rebalance the Court.
	6.	Long-Term Vision and Hope: Despite the challenges, experts remain hopeful, citing active civic engagement as a strength of American democracy. They emphasize that robust advocacy and policy change outside the Court system can continue to protect health rights and address disparities, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s lessons on health inequities.

In summary, Barrett’s confirmation is seen as a critical shift that could impact a range of public health issues and individual rights. Experts advocate for proactive legislative efforts to uphold health protections in light of this judicial shift."

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. photo Denis Kuvaev Shutterstock CNA January 14, 2021 The governor of South Dakota asked state lawmakers on Tuesday to introduce a bill banning abortions based on a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The Declaration of Independence summarizes what we all know in our hearts to be truethat God created each of us and endowed all of us with the right to life. This is true for everyone, including those with an extra chromosome, Gov. Kristi Noem, R, of South Dakota said at her 2021 State of the State address in Pierre. Noem received a standing ovation after that line, from legislators and audience members in the house chamber of the state capitol. She then asked legislators to pass a law that bans the abortion of a preborn child just because that child is diagnosed with Down syndrome, a request that also received applause from audience members. On Fox News on Tuesday, Noem said that every single life is precious, regardless of what situation the family is facing, and that every life is a blessing. She invited the family of former Wisconsin congressman Sean Duffy, a Catholic, to be present at her address the youngest child of the Duffy family, Valentina, has Down syndrome. Valentina has given me as much joy and pride as any of my other little babies, and shes an American, and she has a right to live just like everybody else, Rachel Duffy said on Fox News on Tuesday, appearing alongside Sean and Valentina Duffy, and Noem. I would tell you its scary, because we were scared, Sean Duffy recalled of receiving the Down syndrome diagnosis for their child. Yet, he added, this little girl is the favorite of our family. Noem mentioned Iceland in her address on Tuesday, as one of the European countries on pace to virtually eliminate children with Down syndrome through abortion. Now as South Dakotans, and frankly, as human beings, we should all be appalled by this. We are better than that, she said. In Iceland, according to a 2017 CBS News report, nearly 100 of babies diagnosed with down syndrome are aborted. As CNA reported, only 18 children with Down syndrome were born in Denmark in 2019, the lowest number on record there. In contrast, according to CDC estimates, around 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born annually in the United States, although abortions based on a prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis are still common. Other states in recent years, including Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Mississippi, have enacted bans on abortions conducted because of a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. South Dakota was one of the states to sign on to a brief supporting Tennessees discrimination abortion ban before the courts. In November, 18 states supported Tennessees law banning abortions based on an unborn childs race, sex, or Down syndrome diagnosis. The legislation is facing legal challenges.

Sign Up","South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem recently urged state lawmakers to pass a bill banning abortions based on a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Speaking at the 2021 State of the State address, Noem emphasized that every individual has a right to life, including those with Down syndrome. Citing Iceland’s near-elimination of Down syndrome births due to prenatal screenings and selective abortions, she expressed concern that such trends undermine the value of individuals with disabilities. This statement was met with strong approval from the audience.

Noem invited former Congressman Sean Duffy and his family, including their youngest daughter Valentina, who has Down syndrome, to the address. The Duffys shared their experience, with Sean recalling initial fears after the diagnosis but ultimately describing Valentina as the family’s “favorite” member, bringing them immense joy. Noem’s mention of Iceland highlighted international perspectives, as the country reportedly has an almost 100% abortion rate for babies diagnosed with Down syndrome.

In recent years, other U.S. states, such as Tennessee, Ohio, and Indiana, have enacted similar laws prohibiting abortions solely based on Down syndrome diagnoses. These laws often face legal challenges, but Noem’s initiative aligns South Dakota with this movement, as it previously supported Tennessee’s ban on “discriminatory abortions” based on race, sex, or Down syndrome.

This proposal reflects a broader trend among conservative lawmakers pushing for pro-life measures and seeking to address perceived discrimination against individuals with disabilities before birth."

Wade nears, pressure is building from advocacy groups and workers themselves.Demonstrators outside the state Capitol in Austin protesting the state's restrictive abortion law.Photograph SERGIO FLORESGetty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveIn 2015, as multiple states enacted laws permitting discrimination against gays and lesbians, Apple CEO Tim Cook took to The Washington Post to decry the trend. Discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business, he proclaimed. Salesforce canceled its events in Indiana after the state passed its religious freedom law.Since then, tech companies have denounced anti-LGBTQ legislation, pledged support to Black Lives Matter, and called out restrictions on voting rights. But as states move to restrict abortion and the Supreme Court considers overturning Roe v. Wade, Apple and other big tech companies have been noticeably quieter. The contrast is most pointed in Texas, which in September implemented a law effectively banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, just as tech firms were flocking to the state.Its not entirely clear why companies that spoke out on other issues have been silent on abortion. Abortion is a deeply moral issue for many, but so are LGBTQ rights. Until recently, though, the constitutional right to an abortion has seemed safe. Companies have been slow to acknowledge the threat to Roe, and employees, an important source of pressure on LGBTQ issues, are only just beginning to mobilize around the issue in significant numbers.It wasn't an overnight phenomenon that corporations began to speak out about LGBTQ equality, says Sonja Spoo, director of reproductive rights campaigns at the womens advocacy group UltraViolet. That was years and years of organizing at the shareholder level, at the consumer level, and among employees.Anthony Johndrow, who advises businesses, including tech firms, on their social issue positioning, says companies were caught flat footed by the threats to abortion rights. Many hoped the courts would resolve the issue so they wouldnt have to weigh in. Now they're kind of scrambling.As some advocates worry that Saturdays 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade will be its last, pressure is building on companies to help protect abortion rights, both from advocacy groups and workers themselves.Tech companies decamping from Silicon Valley for the less regulated, lightly taxed pastures of Texas are confronting a political climate out of step with much of their progressive-leaning workforce. Between January 2018 and June 2021, at least 113 California companies relocated to Texas, according to Stanford researchers, including Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, with the pace accelerating in 2021 Tesla joined the exodus last fall. Apple plans to open a 1 billion campus in Austin this year, and just last week, Facebooks parent company, Meta, said it would lease half of Austins tallest building. During the same period, Texas has passed laws restricting reproductive care, voting, and transgender rights, and Governor Greg Abbott has blocked Covid-19 vaccine and mask mandates. Employee resistance has been muted while theyve been allowed to work remotely, but that could change if Covid wanes.Some companies have spoken out and taken action. In 2019, after several states passed laws restricting abortion access, more than 180 CEOs signed an open letter titled Dont Ban Equality. Published in a full-page New York Times ad, it called anti-reproductive-freedom laws bad for business, harming companies diversity and inclusivity initiatives and their ability to recruit top talent. A second letter titled Dont Ban Equality in Texas signed by more than 80 companiesincluding Netflix and Yelpran last fall on the heels of the Texas law. The online dating company Bumble signed the letter and also set up a fund for women seeking abortion care outside of Texas. So did Lyft, which pledged to pay drivers legal fees if they were sued for transporting passengers to abortion clinics.Most PopularCultureMeet the Disney Imagineer Building You a Real-Life HolodeckMarah EakinScienceThe Keys to a Long Life Are Sleep and a Better Dietand MoneyMatt ReynoldsCultureThe Kate Middleton Photos Most Glaring Photoshop MistakesReece RogersGearEVs With Built-In Camera Drones Have Already Landed in ChinaCarlton ReidMost companies that signed the letters were midsize tech and consumer brands trying to attract younger customers and workers, says Jen Stark, senior director of corporate strategy at Tara Health Foundation, which engages the private sector on reproductive rights and helped organize the letters. The largest tech companiesAlphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoftstayed mum. Notably silent, Stark says.Companies were caught flat footed by the threats to abortion rights. Now theyre kind of scrambling.Anthony Johndrow, corporate adviserWIRED contacted 16 tech companies with sizable Texas workforces about the law and its impact on workers. Alphabet, Amazon, Cisco, Dell, Dropbox, eBay, Indeed, Meta, Oracle, PayPal, Samsung, SpaceX, and Tesla did not respond. Intel and Microsoft declined to comment. HP Enterprise has not taken a position on the law, but the company said, We encourage our team members to make their voices heard through advocacy and at the ballot box. The company said its medical plans cover out-of-state medical care, including abortion.We're not asking companies to weigh in on when life begins, Stark says. We're simply asking for companies to understand abortion as a workforce issue that impacts worker well-being and the achievement of an individual's full potential, and see its connection to equity issues around gender and race. Tara Health asks companies to stop donating to anti-choice politicians and to review their benefits to mitigate the impact of abortion restrictions on their workforces.Although the majority of Americans think abortion should be legal, a sizable minority believes the opposite. According to Pew Research, 39 percent of Americans think abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, including 37 percent of women. Thats a large group, including customers, shareholders, and employees who are going to get really, really angry with you for taking a position, says Paul Argenti, a Dartmouth corporate communications professor who wrote an article titled When Should Your Company Speak Up About A Social Issue?But as the spate of LGBTQ corporate activism demonstrated, companies do sometimes speak up, even when it makes people mad. A 2020 George Washington University study of Fortune 500 companies proposed one reason pressure from employee resource groups. The researchers found that in highly educated workforces, LGBTQ employees persuaded companies to take stances on their rights, even when it may have been costly to business.Years ago, companies were reluctant to speak out on LGBTQ issues, says Shelley Alpern, director of corporate engagement for the investment firm Rhia Ventures, which submits shareholder resolutions supporting reproductive rights. Part of what got them to move away from that taboo is that their employees started to speak up through LGBTQ affinity groups, she says. That made a huge difference because I think corporate managers realized this was not an abstract question. This has a real impact on employees.Employee mobilization around abortion rights has yet to reach this level. Johndrow, the reputation adviser, says his clients have not mentioned workplace organizing around the issue. To my knowledge, and I work with a fair number of big companies, there were no groups like that, he says. Im sure theyre forming now.They are, says Deena Fidas, managing director of the LGBTQ workplace equality nonprofit Out and Equal. Fidas is trying to apply the lessons of LGBTQ workplace organizing to reproductive health. LGBTQ pressure campaigns were decades in the making, she says, starting at a time when these workers lacked legal protections against employment discrimination. Now, Fidas works with Tara Health and other organizations to convene womens employee resource groups and help them advocate for access to reproductive care. She says employees are starting to raise the issue as one where their employers should weigh in. Change is definitely afoot.Most PopularCultureMeet the Disney Imagineer Building You a Real-Life HolodeckMarah EakinScienceThe Keys to a Long Life Are Sleep and a Better Dietand MoneyMatt ReynoldsCultureThe Kate Middleton Photos Most Glaring Photoshop MistakesReece RogersGearEVs With Built-In Camera Drones Have Already Landed in ChinaCarlton ReidSeveral factors complicate the issue. For one, womens groups arent monolithic, with many opposing abortion in many or all cases. Even as more women share their stories, a stigma lingers, says Erika Seth Davies, Rhia Venturess CEO. Theres been a hesitancy to talk about this very private health care decision. Also, reproductive rights are just one of many issues competing for working womens attention, particularly during the pandemic. Womens ERGs have been stretched extraordinarily thin and are stretched even more thin now, says Stark.Stanford Business School political economy professor Neil Malhotra has done research showing that employees are attracted to companies that share their values. If businesses perceive that an issue matters to high-skilled employees, he says, they may be more likely to speak up. But most high-skilled tech employees are men, and these high-skilled tech workers have greater access to health care and fewer unplanned pregnancies, so restrictions on abortion may be less salient. With a highly educated, high-income employee base, there could be theoretical reasons that they would care less about abortion than some other social issues, Malhotra says.On September 16, Apple sent out an internal memo reminding employees that its insurance covered comprehensive abortion services and out-of-state travel, as first reported by TechCrunch. For some employees, however, this wasnt enough. A lively discussion erupted on Slack. There were some Texans in that chat who were planning to quit their job and leave the state unless they were granted remote work accommodation, says Janneke Parrish, who worked as an Austin-based program manager for Apple Maps at the time. Not just because of the abortion ban, but also because of Texas anti-trans legislation.We're simply asking for companies to understand abortion as a workforce issue that impacts worker well-being.Jen Stark, senior director of corporate strategy, Tara Health FoundationParrish rallied her colleagues to submit questions to a company town hall meeting the following day. They asked Cook what Apple was doing to protect its employees. According to a recording obtained by The New York Times, Cook said that the company was looking into whether it could aid the legal fight and reassured staff about their insurance coverage.Parrish circulated an open letter asking Apple to review its benefits to ensure they covered medical and surgical abortions and out-of-state travel. The letter, signed by more than 150 employees and posted in multiple Slack channels with thousands of members, also asked Apple to make a public statement denouncing the law.Apple verified the authenticity of the September 16 memo and confirmed that its health insurance covers medical and surgical abortions. It would not comment on whether the company got involved in the legal fight. Like Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies, Apple employs a large subcontractor workforce. When asked if its subcontractors received the same reproductive benefits, Apple referred WIRED to its staffing firms, but would not say which ones it uses in Texas. Three firms that list Apple jobs in TexasApex Systems, WeLocalize, and CSS Corpdid not respond to questions about their benefits.Parrish was later fired and believes it was because of her involvement in workplace organizing, which included her work on AppleToo, a campaign to shed light on alleged employee discrimination and harassment. She filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board. Parrish says her termination had a chilling effect on organizing, driving communications off of Slack. Apple declined to comment on her termination.Most PopularCultureMeet the Disney Imagineer Building You a Real-Life HolodeckMarah EakinScienceThe Keys to a Long Life Are Sleep and a Better Dietand MoneyMatt ReynoldsCultureThe Kate Middleton Photos Most Glaring Photoshop MistakesReece RogersGearEVs With Built-In Camera Drones Have Already Landed in ChinaCarlton ReidOne Apple employee on a Texas-based team, who has been working remotely in another state, says he has thought about quitting if he is forced to relocate to Texas when offices reopen.

I'm sitting here whining to you as a highly paid tech person about my partner not getting that coverage, he says. We have the funds, means, and privilege to be able to get it. What about the support staff for Apple that aren't covered by those policies?If Apple were to speak up here, its voice would be huge, says Parrish. She points to the companys condemnation of laws discriminating against same-sex couples and transgender people. To me, its unconscionable that it would stand up in other instances, but not for the women of Texas.

This stands in contrast to the vocal stances these companies have taken on other social issues like LGBTQ rights, voting restrictions, and racial justice.

Historically, tech companies have taken bold stands against discriminatory laws, such as Apple’s 2015 opposition to anti-LGBTQ laws. However, with the Texas abortion law, many companies, especially the tech giants (Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft), have been notably quiet. This silence is attributed to several factors:
	1.	Lack of Employee Mobilization: While employees have played a crucial role in pressuring companies on LGBTQ and racial justice issues, the same level of activism around abortion rights has not yet reached similar levels. In addition, many women feel a stigma about discussing abortion, and reproductive rights are not always seen as central to women’s work agendas, especially during the pandemic.
	2.	Workforce Demographics: Many tech companies employ highly educated and well-compensated workers, most of whom may not be as directly affected by abortion restrictions, particularly those with access to better healthcare. This makes abortion rights less salient for a significant portion of the workforce, especially compared to other issues.
	3.	Fear of Backlash: There is a concern that taking a public stance on abortion could alienate a substantial portion of customers, shareholders, and employees who hold anti-abortion views. The article highlights that around 39% of Americans think abortion should be illegal in most cases.

Some companies have taken action, such as Lyft and Bumble, which pledged support for employees seeking abortions or signed public letters opposing abortion bans. However, the largest companies like Apple and Google have not followed suit. Apple, for example, did respond internally by affirming that its health insurance covers abortion-related services, but declined to publicly challenge the law or support the legal fight against it.

Employees within these companies, particularly those in Texas, have expressed frustration. For example, Apple employees in Texas have advocated for the company to take a stand and criticized the lack of action. Some even threatened to leave the state or quit their jobs unless the company made more concrete moves. One Apple employee involved in organizing against the law was reportedly fired, raising concerns about potential retaliation against workplace activism.

Despite these challenges, there is a growing movement within tech companies to push for more vocal support of abortion rights, with employee resource groups beginning to form and advocate for reproductive care as a workforce issue that affects well-being and equity, particularly for women and marginalized groups.

In conclusion, while tech companies have been slow to address abortion rights in Texas, there is increasing pressure from employees and advocacy groups to recognize it as a critical issue affecting their workforce, with some companies beginning to take steps towards change."

Marjorie Dannenfelser of SBA Pro-Life, Joe Scheidler of the Pro-Life Action League, Attorney General of Mississippi Lynn Fitch. photo Wikimedia CommonsSteve Sanchez Public DomainShutterstock Lauretta Brown December 30, 2022 The most significant news event in 2022 was 50 years in the making. The Supreme Court handed down a decision this year with the words Roe and Casey are overruled, marking the culmination of almost 50 years of work by pro-life advocates. While the June 24, 2022, Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health decision was a moment of victory for the pro-life movement, it was the result of a multifaceted approach built up over the decades. The Register honors the pro-life leaders who paved the way for Dobbs, many of whom did not live to see this moment, for their efforts to expose the truth that abortion ends a human life. When Roe v. Wade was handed down in January 1973, federal attorney Nellie Gray gathered fellow pro-life advocates in her townhouse on Capitol Hill to devise a way to commemorate Roes anniversary and the lives lost because of the decision. Hoping that Roe would soon be overturned, she organized what she assumed would be a one-off event the March for Life. The demonstration became a 49-year annual human-rights protest that consistently draws tens of thousands of marchers. Jeanne Mancini, current president of the March for Life, told the Register that the day Dobbs was handed down was Grays birthday, and she couldnt imagine a better birthday gift for a woman who chose to put all of her gifts and talents towards the culture of life. Mancini said the annual demonstration that concluded every year outside of the Supreme Court served as one of many factors leading to the eventual overturn of Roe. I cant think of a more powerful statement that Roe wasnt settled law other than the marchers literally going past the Supreme Court every single year, she said. They may feel like one person doesnt make a difference if they come to the march or not, but take all of those people and pull them away, and theres no march. Mancini also praised the spiritual muscle of the pro-life movement, including figures like St. Teresa of Calcutta and Pope St. John Paul II, who fearlessly spoke the truth on abortion throughout their lives. At the National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, Mother Teresa stated in front of former President Bill Clinton and then-first lady Hillary The greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? Mancini said that pro-lifers have worked on the issue in so many different ways over the years. Whether it was the legal angle, the work of pro-life pregnancy centers, or the political side of things, she called it breathtaking how Gods mysterious plans led to this moment of the overturn of Roe, saying God was clearly at work through these advocates to help move us into the next phase of this human-rights issue. Looking Back Among the early pro-life heroes that made the case against abortion was Dr. Jack Willke, a Catholic obstetrician who spoke out against abortion starting in the 1960s and advocated for pregnancy centers and maternity homes, popularizing the phrase love them both. He headed the National Right to Life Committee from 1980 to 1991. Another key influence in the pregnancy-care-center movement was Sister of Social Service Paula Vandegaer, who spoke out on the issue in the 1960s and was one of the founders of Heartbeat International, the first pro-life pregnancy-support center and the largest in the world. Another notable figure in the movement was Dr. Mildred Jefferson, the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, who told Congress in 1981 that Roe gave my profession an almost unlimited license to kill. She was among the founders of the National Right to Life Committee, and then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan credited her with changing his mind on the issue. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, an abortionist-turned-pro-life advocate who founded the abortion advocacy group NARAL, was also an important voice early in the movement with his 1985 film The Silent Scream, which showed the abortion of a 12-week-old unborn baby. He said after his conversion that legal abortion was the greatest mistake this nation has ever conceived. In the Public Eye Joseph Scheidler, dubbed the Godfather of Pro-Life Activism, dedicated his life to pro-life work after a critical moment before Roe was handed down. His son Eric told the Register that the cause became personal for his father at a rally in 1972, where he saw a picture of a garbage bag of aborted babies at a Canadian hospital and one of those babies resembled a baby picture of Eric. The event made his father see a connection between his child and an abortion victim. The moment spurred Scheidler, who passed away in 2021, to utilize his past work in advertising and media to get the word out about the evils of abortion. His son said that after Roe was handed down his father began putting advertisements about resources for women in crisis pregnancies in newspapers on the same page as the abortion ads. Scheidler said his family is still seeing the effectiveness of that technique, saying that a few years ago at an event a family told them that they chose life for their child 40 years ago because of those ads. He said that his father looked for creative ways to reach people, asking, How can we break through the noise on this issue and bring people around to the pro-life side? Scheidlers efforts to break through the noise were occasionally controversial and included showing abortion victim photos in the public square, infiltrating abortionists meetings, and infiltrating speeches by pro-abortion speakers. In his 1985 book Closed 99 Ways to Stop Abortion, Scheidler wrote about practical things pro-lifers could do, including talking to friends and neighbors about the issue, sidewalk counseling, and picketing abortion fundraisers. Eric Scheidler said that he believes his father played a role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but in a way you might not expect, by keeping the abortion issue ever before the American peoples minds and eyes through protests and media appearances. He said that the efforts of his father and others to keep abortion before the public eye kept up an atmosphere of tension around the abortion issue, which motivated voters to back senators who approved the nomination of justices to the Supreme Court making it possible for Roe to be overturned. Political Accountability Marjorie Dannenfelser, who heads SBA Pro-Life America, a group founded in 1992 that funds pro-life candidates, had a lot to do with the political efforts leading to Roe being overturned. In 2016, she spearheaded a letter in which then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to nominate pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dannenfelser told the Register that while that pledge turned out to be very important, given that President Trumps three nominees changed the makeup of the court making the overturning of Roe possible, we would never have received that pledge if we hadnt already built some political strength in the pro-life movement. She said the incentive for a candidate to sign that sort of pledge to pro-life voters came after many milestones over the years swaying public opinion due to the work of churches, state pro-life groups, and scientific advances in sonogram technology. Leveraging the political power of the movement built by early pro-life leaders, Dannenfelser saw a dramatic change when pro-lifers held candidates accountable on the issue. All along the way, she said, when there were candidates or officeholders who failed, it was important to make sure that they felt the sting of disapproval from the pro-life movement. Over the years, the movement found our political voice, and once we made clear that we were a force to be contended with in the political arena, that made the critical Senate, presidential and Supreme Court actions possible. Some of these key actions included then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells decision to wait to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia until after the 2016 presidential election, resulting in Trumps nomination of Neil Gorsuch, later followed by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, to fill the vacancies left by Justice Anthony Kennedys retirement and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs death. The Dobbs Case At this critical moment, the first-ever female attorney general of Mississippi, Lynn Fitch, asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe in their consideration of her states 15-week abortion ban. She wrote in The Washington Post that she understood the magnitude of what was being asked, but argued that the court put political intuition above sound legal reasoning in Roe and that it was time to correct that error. Fitch, a single mom, said Roe pitted women against their children, and that in the years since Roe, it has become easier for women to reach the very pinnacle of our success, economically and socially, fully independent of the right those seven male justices bestowed upon us. On June 24, the day Roe was overturned, Fitch said in a video message that now our work to empower women and promote life truly begins. Since policymaking on the issue has been returned to the states, she saw the urgent need for advocacy for pro-life legislation that protects unborn babies and provides assistance for women in crisis-pregnancy situations. Looking Ahead Dannenfelser said that there is more work than ever before for the pro-life movement, noting that pro-abortion politicians can undo all the state pro-life protections made possible by Dobbs. I think we need to be doing 10 times what we already were doing, she said of the next steps for the pro-life movement, calling for coordination and unity and leveraging of all of the beautiful education tools of the movement to target the individual situation of each state, along with backing pro-life candidates who will prevent efforts, like the extreme Womens Health Protection Act, to undo state protections at the federal level. Mancini said that in response to the cultural backlash and confusion following the Dobbs decision, the pro-life movement should focus on continuing to reach hearts and minds by combating disinformation on the issue, redoubling advocacy efforts at the state and federal level, and increasing the existing network of resources for moms in crisis pregnancies. Editors Note The March for Life will take place on Jan. 20, but will conclude at the U.S. Capitol building instead of the Supreme Court. The group also plans to expand from five to 10 state marches for life in an effort to have demonstrations in all 50 states. Keywords prolife post-roe year in review Dobbs v.

Sign Up","The article Pro-Life Heroes: The Road That Led to the End of Roe, published by the National Catholic Register in 2022, highlights the key figures and efforts that led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Supreme Court decision, which ended nearly 50 years of federal abortion rights.

The article honors pro-life leaders whose decades of advocacy were crucial to the decision. A central figure is Nellie Gray, who founded the March for Life in 1974, an annual event that became a powerful symbol of opposition to abortion. Jeanne Mancini, current president of the March for Life, credits this demonstration and its continual presence outside the Supreme Court as a key factor in challenging the idea that Roe was “settled law.”

The article also highlights spiritual leaders like St. Teresa of Calcutta and Pope St. John Paul II, who outspokenly denounced abortion as a moral evil. These religious leaders’ moral clarity contributed to shifting cultural and political perspectives on abortion.

Several early pro-life advocates are acknowledged, including Dr. Jack Willke, a Catholic obstetrician who promoted pregnancy centers and the slogan “love them both,” and Dr. Mildred Jefferson, the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, who fought against abortion in medical practice. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a former abortionist turned pro-life activist, is also noted for his 1985 film The Silent Scream, which exposed the brutality of abortion.

Joseph Scheidler, known as the “Godfather of Pro-Life Activism,” is celebrated for his media and public campaign efforts, including controversial methods such as displaying graphic abortion images and infiltrating abortionist meetings. His work, particularly through public protests, kept the abortion issue in the public eye, which contributed to the political momentum necessary for the eventual overturning of Roe.

Marjorie Dannenfelser of SBA Pro-Life America is acknowledged for her political efforts, including securing a 2016 pledge from Donald Trump to appoint pro-life justices, which directly influenced the makeup of the Supreme Court. Her group’s work in holding political candidates accountable and building the political strength of the pro-life movement laid the groundwork for the eventual Dobbs decision.

Attorney General Lynn Fitch of Mississippi, who spearheaded the Dobbs case, is recognized for her leadership in advocating for the legal reversal of Roe. She argued that Roe was a legal mistake and that the time had come for the Court to correct it, with the hope of empowering women and promoting life.

The article concludes by noting the ongoing work required of the pro-life movement after Roe’s reversal, particularly in response to political and cultural challenges. Figures like Dannenfelser and Mancini emphasize the need for continued advocacy, especially in securing pro-life legislation at the state level and combating disinformation in the aftermath of Dobbs.

The pro-life movement, they argue, must be prepared to counter efforts by pro-abortion politicians to reverse state protections and must continue to support women in crisis pregnancies."

Thousands of pro-choice activists wave their iconic green handkerchiefs and demonstrate in favor of decriminalizing abortion outside Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on February 19, 2020. 2020 Natacha PisarenkoAP Photo Summary When the Argentine Senate narrowly rejected a bill to decriminalize abortion in 2018, the country missed a historic opportunity to advance sexual and reproductive rights. Rejection of the reform has left women, girls and pregnant people in Argentina, particularly those who are low income and live in rural areas, with limited access to abortion, seriously undermining their lives and health. The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown create new barriers for women and girls to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights. A nearly century-old exceptions model largely bans abortion in Argentina. Section 86 of the 1921 criminal code allows three exceptions to an otherwise blanket criminal prohibition. Abortion is allowed only when a pregnancy endangers the life or health of a woman, girl, or pregnant person or when it results from rape. In all other circumstances, abortion is banned and punished. The criminal code imposes prison sentences of up to 4 years on women who self-induce or consent to an abortion and up to 15 years on anyone who provides them. The 2018 draft bill, proposed by the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion, a coalition of nongovernmental organizations throughout the country, would have largely done away with the exceptions model and decriminalized abortion. It would have granted anyone who becomes pregnant access to abortion for whatever reason in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. After 14 weeks, the exceptions model of section 86 would have remained in force, but with an additional exception when the fetus has serious complications incompatible with life outside of the womb. The debate in Congress was, highly contentious throughout the country, reflecting a deep rift in Argentine society. The green scarves of pro-choice champions and, to a lesser extent, the light blue scarves of opposition groups colored the streets, as demonstrations grew. The debate took over dinner-table conversations among families and friends. On June 13, 2018, the 257-member Chamber of Deputies approved the bill, moving it to the Senate. On August 8, the 72-member Senate rejected the bill by a seven-vote margin, with three abstentions. 2020 Human Rights WatchCamila attends a rally in Buenos Aires, March 9, 2020 . 2020 Human Rights WatchGeraldine attends the March 9, 2020 rally in Buenos Aires. 2020 Human Rights WatchA demonstrators shirt at the March 9, 2020 rally reads Sexual education to choose, contraceptives to avoid abortion, and legal abortion so you dont die. 2020 Human Rights WatchSol. March 9, 2020 rally. 2020 Human Rights WatchA group of friends attends the March 9 rally. While the rejection was a setback for human rights in Argentina, a broad range of experts and civil society representatives had participated in the Congressional debate, shedding new light on the need for access to safe and legal abortion. The discussion also exposed the fact that even pregnant people whose lives or health are in danger, or whose pregnancies resulted from rape, are often unable to obtain a safe and legal abortion under section 86 due to multiple barriers restricting their rights. Authoritative interpretations of international human rights law establish that denying women and girls access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. Key international human rights are at risk when abortion is illegal or inaccessible. In this report, Human Rights Watch documents obstacles to access legal abortion that reveal that the exception model currently in place is far more restrictive in practice than what is allowed under the legal system. Broad criminalization of abortion creates several obstacles to pregnant people seeking access to abortion, including lack of public information about the scope of the legal grounds for abortion, particularly regarding the health exception unnecessary hurdles imposed by health facilities, such as illegal requirements that parents, partners, or judicial or child protection authorities authorize access to abortion or contraception arbitrary waiting periods imposed by health facilities and the illegal requirement of police reports or to obtain a court order to proceed with an abortion under the rape exception. In response to Covid-19, Argentinas government imposed a mandatory, nationwide quarantine on March 20 that limited mobility except in very specific circumstances.1 The lockdown, which has been extended several times although local authorities gradually lifted certain restrictions, has forced many women and girls to stay at home, which could delay the detection of pregnancies and the request for legal abortions, especially for girls and adolescents.2 Human Rights Watch research globally shows that limitations on travel and transport create further barriers for women and girls to access healthcare, abortion, and post-abortion services in a timely manner, as abortion-services are limited and not available in every health facility and hospital. This is certainly the case in Argentina, where given existing barriers described in this report, access to abortion will be even harder given the lockdown implemented by the government. Furthermore, the need to visit multiple health centers and travel sometimes for hours to obtain access to sexual and reproductive services multiply the risks of contagion. In researching this report, Human Rights Watch interviewed five women and one girl who had tried to access legal abortion in Buenos Aires city and several provinces between October 2019 and February 2020. For many, the antiquated exceptions model of section 86 had proven an insurmountable barrier, making even legal abortion in Argentina difficult or inaccessible. We also documented 13 additional cases through interviews with 24 health providers, social workers, activists, and lawyers who had supported women and girls seeking abortions, and supporting documentation. Access to legal abortion and post-abortion care after an illegal procedure depends heavily on the persons socio-economic background and where they live. In some instances, health institutions arbitrarily imposed gestational limits on accessing legal procedures. In other cases, healthcare providers invoked conscientious objection in areas of the country where no effective referral mechanisms exist and other meaningful options were not available. In other cases, lack of access to safe and legal abortion methods or lack of nearby health facilities offering abortion made it harder for people to access abortion in a timely fashion. Women, health professionals, and feminist activists told Human Rights Watch that fear of legal consequences, including criminal prosecution, and stigmatization deter pregnant people from seekingand health professionals from providingabortions, even when requirements for an exception under section 86 are met. Nineteen women, girls, activists, and health providers we interviewed had encountered abuse and mistreatment in their efforts to obtain or provide safe abortion and post-abortion care. This included cruel behavior and humiliation by healthcare providers, denial of access to or refusal to provide legal health services, and violation of medical confidentiality in health-care settings. Argentinas current criminal code has created an unworkable model. Five of Argentinas 23 provinces3 have neither promulgated their own regulations for access to legal abortion nor adhered to the regulations adopted by the National Health Ministry. These regulations include technical guidelines and protocols adopted since 2007 and updated in 2010, 2015 and finally 2019 with the National Protocol for Comprehensive Care of People Entitled to Legal Termination of Pregnancy, the first to become a Ministerial Resolution.4 The lack of clear and consistent regulations across the country results in a patchwork of practices that disproportionately harm pregnant people of limited resources or with less access to information about their rights, exposing them to health complications or even death from unsafe abortions, because it forces them to seek the procedure outside the scope and regulation of the state. Moreover, criminalizing abortion does not prevent pregnant people from ending unwanted pregnancies. Criminalization of the procedure does make it difficult for governments to monitor and ensure reliable data on abortion. Argentina does not systematically track the total number of abortions performed each year. Using a complex methodology based on data from 2004 and 2005, a study has estimated that between 371,965 and 522,000 abortions are performed annually. This estimate does not specify how many are unsafe or performed outside of the legal exceptions.5 Criminalizing abortion forces many pregnant people in Argentina to seek abortions outside of the national health system, many of which are performed in unsafe conditions. Many of them, particularly those who are poor or live in rural areas, resort to risky self-induced abortions, or seek assistance from untrained providers. The World Health Organization determined that 3 out of 4 abortions performed in Africa and Latin America from 2010 through 2014 were unsafe.6 Several international health organizations link unsafe abortions to maternal deaths. Globally, the WHO reports that between 4.7 and 13.2 percent of maternal deaths every year can be attributed to unsafe abortions.7 In 2018, Argentinas National Health Ministry reported 35 deaths resulting from abortion, including ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages, medical abortion, and failed attempt of abortion, representing more than 13 percent of all maternal deaths that year.8 Many of those deaths are preventable. The WHO elaborates that most maternal mortality could be avoided through sex education, use of effective contraception, provision of safe, legal abortion and proper emergency treatment of abortion complications.9 Unsafe abortion increases in the context of criminalization. Unsafe abortion can lead to short- or long-term consequences, including heavy bleeding, infection, and damage to the genital tract and internal organs.10 The Guttmacher Institute, a global reproductive rights research organization based in the United States, reports that about 40 percent of women worldwide who have a clandestine abortion experience complications that require treatment.11 In 2016, 39,025 women and girls were admitted to public hospitals for health issues arising from abortions or miscarriages.12 Sixteen percent, or 6,164, were girls or adolescents ages 10 to 19. These numbers likely represent only a fraction of the total number of pregnant people who need medical care for health complications from unsafe abortions in Argentina, as they only capture those admitted in hospitals while leaving outside those who sought care in the private health sector, and those who were deterred from seeking care. Women, health professionals, and feminist activists told Human Rights Watch that fear of criminal prosecution and stigmatization often keeps women from seeking post-abortion care when they experience complications from abortions performed outside of the legal exceptions. The decriminalization of abortion in Argentina is essential for pregnant people to fully exercise their sexual and reproductive rights. Authoritative interpretations of international human rights law establish that denying women and girls access to abortion jeopardizes a range of human rights, including the rights to life, health, freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, physical integrity, nondiscrimination and equality, privacy, information, and the right to decide the number and spacing of children. The Argentine national legislature has ratified the international human rights treaties that recognize these rights. The Argentine Constitution has incorporated the treaties and gives preeminence to international human rights standards for interpreting laws within Argentina. Yet, as long as Argentina criminalizes abortion, pregnant people, particularly those who rely on the public health system, and even more so those who live in provinces that lack or do not implement abortion regulations, will confront unjust challenges in exercising their rights. Fifteen years after Human Rights Watch first released a report documenting barriers to abortion and post-abortion care in Argentina, our research for this report revealed that most barriers remain, and the rights of women, girls, and pregnant people continue to be denied.13 The consequence, we found, has been needless suffering, at times even deatha dreadful human cost preventable through the decriminalization of abortion. Recommendations Despite sporadic progress, many of the recommendations that Human Rights Watch made to the Argentine government in 2005 and 2010 remain pertinent, particularly regarding access to legal and safe abortion that meet the exception criteria contained in section 86 of the Criminal Code, and post-abortion services in all cases. However, additional steps should be taken to decriminalize abortion. The following recommendations aim to guarantee the rights of all who can become pregnant to sexual and reproductive health through effective regulation of the healthcare system, accountability for discriminatory practices, and dissemination of accurate information. These recommendations aim at protecting the rights to life, physical integrity, health, nondiscrimination, privacy, liberty, information, equal protection under the law, freedom of religion and conscience, and decisions about the number and spacing of children. In May 2020, Argentinas government joined dozens of other governments world-wide signing a statement to protect sexual and reproductive health and rights and to promote a gender-responsiveness in the Covid-19 crisis.14 To fulfill such commitment, in addition to the recommendations detailed below, the government of Argentina should, during the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic, ensure that abortion is treated as essential and time-sensitive health care, and guarantee sexual and reproductive health services, goods, and information in a timely manner, including at the provincial and municipal levels. It should also authorize and make available, in a timely manner, telehealth consultations for anyone who is seeking abortion care or information and adopt measures so these consultations are free or low cost and easily accessible for marginalized groups. The government should also ensure women and girls can access medical abortion from home, and doctors can prescribe the necessary abortion medication via telehealth. To the President of Argentina Propose a bill to the national Congress to decriminalize abortion in all circumstances and regulate it in a manner that fully respects the autonomy of pregnant people. Work jointly with civil society groups in drafting the bill and seek full support of the draft bill from legislators of various political parties and from civil society groups. Guarantee safe abortion services at various levels of health care15 and, following World Health Organization recommendations,consider broadening the range of practitioners qualified to perform abortions to include nursing assistants, nurses, midwives, non-clinical doctors, among others.16 Urge provincial governments to take immediate steps to ensure access to safe, legal abortion and post-abortion services, including by adopting the National Protocol. Ensure public information is disseminated nationwide to the public, particularly to women and girls, national and local authorities and health professionals, that clarifies the circumstances under which abortion is currently legal, clearly stating the governments obligation to provide abortion and post-abortion services and detailing where they can be obtained. Urge the provincial governments of San Juan and Mendoza to work with their legislatures to repeal laws that prohibit the sale of Misoprostol in pharmacies. To the National Health Ministry Ensure the National Directorate of Sexual and Reproductive Health Direccin Nacional de Salud Sexual y Reproductiva has sufficient budget and personnel to work effectively with provincial authorities to guarantee access to sexual and reproductive health practices, including legal abortion, nationwide. Guarantee access to free contraception, as stipulated in the Responsible Sexual and Reproductive Health Law of 2002, ensuring availability of different methods of contraception and training of health professionals, as well as implementing nationwide campaigns to disseminate relevant information on this law.17 Extend the coverage of the National Plan for the Prevention of Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence ENIA throughout the country, allocating sufficient funds to ensure its effective implementation. Monitor the implementation of foreseeable legal reforms including medical and surgical methods that the WHO considers best practices for safe abortion care in the National Mandatory Medical Program Programa mdico obligatorio, PMO, guaranteeing universal access to safe practices.18 Expand monitoring through the Federal Health Council Consejo Federal de Salud of implementation of the Protocol for Comprehensive Care of People Entitled to Legal Termination of Pregnancy throughout the country. Work with provincial and municipal health authorities to identify deficiencies and barriers in access to legal abortion in each province and health jurisdiction. In particular, identify Cases of individual negligence and proactively urge administrative investigations and hold health personnel who do not comply with ministerial guidelines, regulations, or laws on service provision accountable Systemic conditions, including unavailability or accessibility of abortion and post abortion care, and design and implement solutions to overcome them and Emergency measures that should be taken to guarantee access to legal abortion for people needing immediate care while systemic reform is underway. Ensure the availability of necessary supplies to perform both medical and surgical abortions as required by law in all public health institutions nationwide. Develop technical training for safe abortion practices with the best technical standards and work with provincial governments to implement training in all provinces. Ensure that all national sexual and reproductive health protocols and provincial protocols and regulations, include the following A counselling process to determine whether pregnant people planned and want their pregnancies, and a discussion of their options and availability of referrals for psychosocial support when needed Harm reduction counseling on the safety and risk of different measures used to induce abortion and information on when and how to access post-abortion care for women and girls who may wish to terminate pregnancies but lack access to legal abortion under section 86 Disseminate information and ensure effective implementation regarding guidelines for attending to patients with incomplete abortions or post-abortion complications according to best practices in a prompt, neutral, professional, rights-respecting, and non-discriminatory manner, including a specific requirement that patients not be denied pain management or left waiting as punishment Routine post-delivery and post-abortion contraceptive counseling to ensure all people of reproductive age have comprehensive and accurate information about how to prevent pregnancy and Availability of psychosocial support services for pregnant adolescent and girls when needed. Ensure that all hospital directors, health professionals, and health system personnel receive training on relevant laws, regulations, and technical guidelines on legal abortion and reproductive health and the provisions of the law regarding the criminal liability of public officials who do not fulfill their duties or who violate professional confidentiality.19 Work with provincial governments to ensure such training in all provinces. Systematically gather data and information on access to legal abortions, availability of contraceptives, and training of health personnel. Analyze and publish an annual report on implementation of protocols, identifying deficiencies. Implement a national campaign to disseminate information about the 0800 Sexual Health line, administered by the National Health Ministry, which facilitates access to sexual and reproductive health information and services across the country. Ensure the availability of different contraceptive methods, and access to tubal ligation and vasectomies without discriminatory restrictions. Promote the approval of all drugs that are nationally and internationally recognized as the best standard for the provision of safe medical abortions, as recommended by the WHO, particularly Mifepristone, which is currently unavailable in Argentina. To the National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices ANMAT Approve any request from the National Health Ministry of production andor distribution of Mifepristone as recommended by the WHO. Ensure the distribution of Misoprostol and Mifepristone in pharmacies under a monitoring system implemented by the National Health Ministry that guarantees the availability of medicines for the safe practice of outpatient abortions, which do not require hospitalization, as recommended by the WHO and other national and international organizations. To the National Congress Decriminalize abortion as a matter of urgency, by repealing the provisions of the criminal code that criminalize abortion and adopt a new legal framework that ensures people who become pregnant can safely and legally access abortion. Decriminalization must cover people providing or assisting in the provision of safe abortion care. Include medical and surgical methods that the WHO considers best practices for safe abortion care in the National Mandatory Medical Program Programa mdico obligatorio, PMO, guaranteeing universal access to safe practices. To the National and Provincial Justice Systems Issue clear guidelines to reinforce the prohibition for judicial officials to accept or act upon information divulged in violation of professional secrecy by health personnel, in particular to investigate allegations of abortion-related crimes. Collect and analyze data on the number of health professionals and people who have had abortions who have been investigated andor punished for the crime of abortion. Comply with the Supreme Court ruling on the F.A.L. case,20 which noted that the need to file a police report or obtain a court order to end a pregnancy resulting from rape is illegal. To Provincial and Municipal Governments Identify deficiencies and barriers to legal abortion in each province and health jurisdiction. In particular, identify Identify emergency measures that should be taken to guarantee access to legal abortion for people needing immediate care while systemic reform is underway. In the absence of provincial regulations governing legal abortion, or in cases in which provinces need to adjust their local regulations to constitutional and human rights standards, adopt or adhere to the National Protocol for Comprehensive Care of People Entitled to Legal Termination of Pregnancy to avoid disparities in access to the law in various provinces of the country. Implement a campaign to inform pregnant people who seek healthcare at provincial and municipal level facilities about all of the cases under which people have the right to request legal abortion under the health exception. Ensure that all public health facilities, regardless of their level of care, eliminate illegal and medically unnecessary requirements, such as partner authorization, more than one health professionals opinion, and certain medical tests, and have referral systems in place to avoid delays that hamper prompt access to medical care. Ensure that any health institution that may be called upon to perform an abortion or provide post-abortion care has sufficient staff to guarantee, on a permanent basis, the exercise of the rights to reproductive freedom conferred by law. Consider eliminating the possibility for individuals to invoke conscientious objection to refuse to perform abortion in public care services. So long as the possibility to invoke conscientious objection to refuse services exists, ensure both by law and in practice its invocation does not impose burdens or delays in accessing legal abortion services. Prohibit its exercise in emergency or other urgent care situations, and in any situation where a facility does not have in place an effective referral system to guarantee the person can and does have access to abortion services in another near facility in a timely manner. Require that all health facilities have sufficient willing, trained health professionals available to carry out abortion services in a timely manner when needed, and that they have a system in place to demonstrate that this is the case in practice. For example, to prevent health professionals arbitrarily invoking conscientious objection so that access could be denied, facilities should require providers to declare in advance if they intend to invoke conscientious objection to abortion services and only those who have made an advance declaration may invoke it. Develop affirmative provincial and municipal measures to increase the number of health personnel available to perform abortions, in places they are lacking. Provide technical training and ensure the supplies necessary for performing abortions according to the highest technical and medical standards are available. Ensure distribution of, and access to, the abortifacient Misoprostol in every province and municipality. To Provincial Congresses Discuss and adopt any pending bills that would lead to improvements at the provincial level in access to legal abortion and the termination of pregnancy on request, as follow-up to the legal reforms recommended above to the National Congress. Repeal any norms that hinder access to legal and safe abortion, including the regulations in San Juan and Mendoza that prohibit the sale of Misoprostol in pharmacies,21 and the norm in Buenos Aires City that forces pregnant people carrying anencephalic fetuses to continue pregnancies until week 24 or at the minimum gestational age for viability Law 1044.22 Methodology This report is based on field research carried out in the provinces of Salta, Chaco, Santa Fe, Entre Ros, and Buenos Aires, as well as Buenos Aires City, in November and December 2019. Desk research and additional interviews by phone, carried out during those months and in January and February 2020, also contributed to our findings. Human Rights Watch interviewed a total of 30 people, mostly individually. We interviewed eight activists, lawyers, and other civil society actors with expertise on sexual and reproductive health rights five women and one girl who had a personal experience seeking abortion care in the public and private health system in the provinces of Salta, Chaco, Entre Ros, Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires City and 16 doctors or health professionals from public hospitals and health centers in those provinces. Human Rights Watch identified interviewees with the assistance of non-governmental organizations NGOs, advocates, feminist activists and lawyers, and service providers. In January, Human Rights Watch met with Argentinas Health Minister and followed up with an information request to ministry staff involved in creating, implementing, and overseeing the National Protocol. In February, Human Rights Watch sent information requests to the Sexual and Reproductive Health Directorate of the National Health Ministry and the Attorney Generals Office. The response from the Sexual and Reproductive Health Directorate of the National Health Ministry was received on February 11, 2020 is reflected in this report. The Attorney Generals Office had not replied at time of writing. Our conclusions build on extensive research conducted by Human Rights Watch in Argentina in 2004, 2005, and 2010. We also analyzed relevant national laws and policies reports by United Nations agencies and NGOs official health data and public health studies and recent evaluations of the Argentine health system published in medical journals, news outlets, and academic research journals. The analysis in this report is drawn from experiences recounted by women and girls, doctors and others interviewed with direct experience with barriers to accessing abortion care. It is not a comprehensive picture of reproductive health care access and rights in Argentina today. Qualitative research and official data support the reports conclusions. In most cases, the names of the hospitals and cities where we conducted interviewsand the names of intervieweeshave been withheld or changed to protect peoples privacy and safety. When requested, identifying information for government officials has also been withheld. Human Rights Watch informed all interviewees about the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways in which the information would be used. Participants were informed that they could end the interview at any time or refuse to answer any of the questions, and that this would not have negative consequences. All the people interviewed expressed, in writing or orally, their informed consent to participate. This written consent is stored in a secure location within the possession of Human Rights Watch. Care was taken with victims of trauma to minimize the risk that recounting their experiences could further traumatize them. Where appropriate, Human Rights Watch provided contact information for organizations offering legal, counseling, health, or social services. Human Rights Watch did not provide any type of financial compensation or other incentives to those who participated. All interviews were conducted in Spanish.

It outlines several key recommendations to ensure access to abortion and related services, focusing on expanding the range of qualified practitioners, enhancing public education, and reinforcing legal protections.
	1.	Expansion of Practitioners: The report advocates for broadening the range of practitioners who can legally perform abortions, including nurses, midwives, and non-clinical doctors, in alignment with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.
	2.	Provincial and National Government Actions: It urges provincial governments to adopt the National Protocol for legal abortion care, address regional disparities in access (such as the prohibition of Misoprostol in certain provinces), and ensure public information is distributed nationwide. The National Health Ministry is tasked with allocating adequate resources to guarantee access to legal abortion services, contraception, and sexual health education.
	3.	Legal and Policy Reforms: Decriminalization of abortion is stressed as a priority. The report calls for the repeal of criminal code provisions that criminalize abortion and the adoption of a new legal framework that ensures safe and legal abortion access for pregnant people, including those providing or assisting in abortion services.
	4.	Health and Justice System Responsibilities: The report calls for stronger guidelines to prevent health professionals from violating patient confidentiality or withholding abortion care. It also demands accountability for any health personnel who fail to comply with legal requirements or ethical standards.
	5.	Training and Protocols: The Ministry of Health is urged to provide ongoing training for health professionals on legal abortion protocols, including counseling, post-abortion care, and patient rights. The report also calls for clear and accessible information on abortion services to be disseminated to the public.
	6.	Conscientious Objection and Emergency Measures: While acknowledging the right to conscientious objection, the report emphasizes that it should not delay or deny access to abortion services, especially in emergencies. It recommends measures to ensure health facilities have sufficient staff and resources to provide legal abortion services without unnecessary delays.
	7.	Monitoring and Data Collection: Regular data collection and monitoring of abortion access, contraceptive availability, and training are encouraged to identify gaps in service delivery and inform future reforms.

The report also details the methodology behind its findings, based on field research, interviews with women, health professionals, and activists, and an analysis of national laws and public health data. The conclusions advocate for urgent action to align Argentina’s legal and health systems with international standards on reproductive rights, ensuring that safe, legal, and accessible abortion care is available to all."

The law requires anyone under 18 to get consent from a parent or legal guardian before having an abortion. Most young people under 18 voluntarily involve a parent or another trusted adult in their abortion decision, even if the law doesnt require it. But for those who dont often because they fear abuse, deterioration of family relationships, being kicked out of the home, or being forced to continue a pregnancy laws like Floridas pose a barrier to their care. Florida reproductive justice advocates opposed the law, arguing that lawmakers should trust young people to make decisions that are best for their health and lives. I joined them in the state capital, Tallahassee, to testify at a Senate hearing about how forced parental consent would undermine young peoples human rights. But its important for young people in Florida who need abortion care to know they still have options, even without involving a parent. Floridas law allows young people to choose a process called judicial bypass and show a judge they are mature enough to make an abortion decision without their parents, or that involving their parents is not in their best interest. These young people will have a court-appointed attorney, and wont have to pay any legal fees. Floridians for Reproductive Freedom has information about the process on their website. Janes Due Process has a hotline that anyone in the country can call for more information 1-866-999-5263. The national organization IfWhenHow has a wiki page with information about judicial bypass in every state. Power U is hosting a tweetstorm today to ensure young people know what this law means for them. Follow at myvoicemychoice. For those who want to help young people navigate this process, Florida reproductive justice advocate Stephanie Loraine published guidance on being a compassionate and effective helper. Floridas law is a sobering reminder that attempts to restrict access to abortion care wont end with this weeks Supreme Court decision. Its also a moment in which the work of reproductive justice groups is especially valuable, as they help to ensure that young people in Florida can still access abortion and get the care they need.

While many young people willingly involve a parent or trusted adult in their decision, the law creates a barrier for those who fear abuse, family conflict, or being forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy. Reproductive justice advocates argue that young people should have the autonomy to make decisions regarding their health without government interference.

Despite the law, Florida allows a judicial bypass process. This means minors can go to court to seek permission for an abortion without parental involvement if they can prove they are mature enough to make the decision or if involving their parents would be detrimental to their well-being. A court-appointed attorney assists them, and they do not incur legal fees.

Reproductive justice organizations like Janes Due Process and IfWhenHow offer resources and guidance on navigating the judicial bypass process. The law, while a setback, highlights the importance of such advocacy groups in helping ensure young people still have access to necessary abortion care. The case also serves as a reminder that restrictions on abortion access will continue, especially following the Supreme Court’s actions on abortion laws."

Earl Neikirk for The Washington PostListen13 minShareAdd to your saved storiesSaveBecky Hubbard, 46, has decided to get sterilized so that she can go back on the only medication that has relieved her disabling pain from rheumatoid arthritis for the last eight years.Soon after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the Tennessee woman said she got an ultimatum from her rheumatologist. If she wanted to stay on the treatment of choice for her condition, a drug called methotrexate, she was told she had to go on birth control despite her age and history of infertility.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIt is frustrating as hell, said Hubbard, a former nurse who lives in Johnson City, Tenn., now waiting to see her gynecologist.The sudden imposition of antiabortion laws after Roes reversal has left patients, doctors and pharmacists wading through a minefield of treatment issues and legal and ethical dilemmas related to womens health care even in situations like Hubbards that have nothing to do with pregnancy.AdvertisementMedicines that treat conditions from cancer to autoimmune diseases to ulcers can also end a pregnancy or cause birth defects. As a result, doctors and pharmacists in more than a dozen states with strict abortion restrictions must suddenly navigate whether and when to order such drugs because they could be held criminally liable and lose their licenses for prescribing some of them to pregnant women.A look at some medications under increased scrutiny amid abortion bansEven if they can show their patients suffer from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, some doctors worry they could be prosecuted for prescribing such drugs to a patient with an unintended pregnancy. Such patients are also at greater risk because they can no longer seek abortions in their home states should they accidentally become pregnant while taking such drugs no matter how grievous the injuries to the developing fetus.Methotrexate is just the tip of the iceberg, said Traci Poole, a practicing pharmacist and faculty member at Belmont University College of Pharmacy in Nashville. If you are of childbearing age, are you going to be denied medications that could potentially interfere with a pregnancy?AdvertisementThere are no reliable estimates of how many women like Hubbard may have had their treatment regimens affected under the spate of new abortion bans. But some patient advocates say they have received dozens of reports from people encountering obstacles in the weeks since Roes reversal.We were surprised at the sheer number of complaints from people with arthritis and autoimmune conditions who were having problems filling prescriptions for methotrexate after the Dobbs decision, said Steven Newmark, director of policy and chief legal officer for the Global Healthy Living Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of people with chronic diseases.The group is now attempting to check those accounts, submitted through CreakyJoints, its digital forum for people with arthritis and their caregivers. Newmark said the group has also reached out to elected officials to try to clarify state policies so far with no success. He said he would be surprised if even those with strong antiabortion views would not want to protect people living in pain.AdvertisementTrigger laws should not be impacting chronically ill patients in need of medication, he said.Tell The Post How has the end of Roe v. Wade affected your experience with reproductive health care?Doctors and pharmacists acknowledge being blindsided by the speed of the changes to state laws and say they are making changes to their practices to protect against liability. Major pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens, for instance, are instructing employees to make extra checks to validate that prescriptions will not be used to terminate pregnancies and delay filling them until their intended use is confirmed.Civil rights and womens advocates denounce many of these changes, questioning whether they may violate federal protections against discrimination on the basis of sex or disability. The issues are particularly disturbing, they say, since women are far more likely than men to have autoimmune diseases, and to be treated for conditions ranging from acne to anxiety and depression.AdvertisementWe are seeing the spillover effects of Dobbs, said Usha Ranji, associate director for womens health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy. The impact is going to fall hard on women.Antiabortion activists, for their part, reject that view. They say theyre troubled by accounts like Hubbards because they never intended to restrict drugs like methotrexate to women with chronic health conditions.Katie Glenn, state policy director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an antiabortion advocacy group, said doctors and pharmacists should not have any concerns about prescribing those drugs to their patients, as long as they are not doing so to terminate a pregnancy.Intent is the key here, Glenn said. If youre a rheumatologist, youre not doing abortions. If youve never prescribed methotrexate for abortion, youre free to continue prescribing it as you were.The gold standardFor Hubbard, Roes reversal has been life-changing. Before Tennessees heartbeat ban blocked most abortions in the state, she said her doctors had no problem treating her with methotrexate even though she wasnt taking birth control.AdvertisementShe and her husband have been unable to conceive for nearly two decades so the chance of her becoming pregnant in her late 40s seemed minuscule. She had taken birth control pills years ago, which she believes affected her health, so she is loath to try them again. She has similar worries about an IUD.With Roe v. Wade overturned, the legality of abortion has been left to the states. Some worry that access to certain types of contraception could be next. Video Julie Yoon, Hadley Green, Sarah HashemiThe Washington PostBut most of all, she hates the idea of going off methotrexate, an extraordinarily effective anti-inflammatory taken by nearly 60 percent of all rheumatoid arthritis patients, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.It is the gold standard for almost every rheumatological or autoimmune disease that affects the connective tissue, especially the joints, said Fehmida Zahabi, a rheumatologist in the north Dallas area and president of the State of Texas Association of Rheumatologists.The drug has gained notoriety for other uses as well. Methotrexate is specifically named in several abortion bans because at a higher dose, it has been used to induce abortions and also to end ectopic pregnancies when an embryo implants outside the uterus a dire situation in which the fertilized egg cannot survive and must be removed to avoid life-threatening complications for the mother.AdvertisementIt can also lead to birth defects, and the potential of accidental pregnancies in places where abortion is banned has led some rheumatologists to reconsider prescribing the drug to women of childbearing age.Share this articleShareWhat Hubbard knows is that a treatment regimen featuring methotrexate enabled her to resume her life after her arthritis had become so crippling she had to stop working as a nurse. Although she began taking the medication in 2014, it has taken years of trial and error to find the right combination and dosages of drugs to keep the disease from progressing. While she still cant work full time, she said she sells crafts that she makes at home and is able to spend more time with her adopted 14-year-old son.She said she fears that without methotrexate, her pain would take over her life again. If you cant get the medicine that gets you out of the flares, you just have to live with the pain, Hubbard said. Its awful.AdvertisementNewmark, the patient advocate, noted that the difference between taking medication and not for those with severe rheumatoid arthritis is the difference between living normally and writhing in pain in bed. Switching to another treatment is not simple, either, he added, because patients often spend years experimenting to find the right combination of drugs to keep their diseases in check.Hubbards doctor declined to comment for this story, saying he could not discuss an individual patients treatment.Most medical groups say they are sympathetic to the plight of such patients and looking to see what steps they might take to protect them.Physicians have been placed in an impossible situation trying to meet their ethical duties to place patient health and well-being first, while attempting to comply with vague, restrictive, complex, and conflicting state laws that interfere in the practice of medicine and jeopardize the health of patients, Jack Resneck Jr., president of the American Medical Association, told federal lawmakers on July 19.AdvertisementThe American College of Rheumatology assembled a task force last month to try to assess the scope of the problem, said Kenneth Saag, the groups president. There is concern that one of the unintended consequences is that patients are going to have reduced access to this medicine and other medicines, he said.Physicians are also worried about their potential liability from antiabortion laws that took effect virtually overnight in some states following the high courts decision, said Saag, director of the division of clinical rheumatology the University of Alabama at Birmingham.Theyre also concerned about the ramifications of accidental pregnancies. While doctors prescribing drugs such as methotrexate routinely talk to their patients about the importance of birth control, he said, unintended pregnancies occur, posing distressing questions for doctors and patients.Some women have elected historically to consider pregnancy termination in such situations, he said. In some places, that may no longer be an option.Anxious patientsAs doctors balance their liability against their patients needs and medical standards of care, women who depend on such drugs say they feel frightened and anxious about whether they will be able to obtain their next refill.Claire Eby, who lives near Austin, has taken methotrexate since she was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis at age 4. When she was 18, her doctors tried to wean her off the drug, believing she was going into remission.Things went down south really fast, said Eby, now 26. She developed inflammation in her eyes, which led to cataracts. The medicine that stopped her eyes from deteriorating further was methotrexate.Your health can deteriorate rapidly and also permanently, if you stop taking methotrexate, Eby said. My vision damage was permanent.Eby said she takes birth control, but her doctors also recently added a pregnancy test to the routine lab work she has to undergo every three months to stay on the medication a change that coincided with Texass increasingly strict abortion restrictions.They hadnt done that before, Eby said.Doctors usually recommend against stopping methotrexate without being weaned off slowly, and some patients worry that getting cut off from the drug when they go to get a refill could be dangerous.Its not safe to just cold-turkey stop, said lupus patient Becky Schwartz, 27, who lives in Tysons, Va.She said the firm that owns her rheumatologists practice put a temporary pause on methotrexate prescriptions in July as it evaluates the laws that took effect after the Supreme Courts decision, although Virginia has not imposed new abortion restrictions.Schwartz said she is grateful that she had just refilled her prescription before the new policy took effect, and she and her doctor came up with an emergency plan to wean her off the drug safely.But the date her prescription runs out looms big. I will have no meds left come September, she said.Since the Supreme Courts decision, pharmacists, who have liability for prescriptions they dispense, also have been scrambling to figure out how to respond.At least one of the nations largest pharmacy chains has told their pharmacists in states with abortion bans to ask for diagnosis codes before dispensing drugs like methotrexate and misoprostol, which is used to complete miscarriages as well as for abortions. Were committed to supporting womens health care, said Mike DeAngelis, CVSs executive director for corporate communications. But he added, These laws, some of which include criminal penalties, have forced us to require pharmacists in these states to validate that the intended indication is not to terminate a pregnancy.A spokesman for Walgreens said that national pharmacy chain is also taking trigger laws into consideration when filling prescriptions for drugs that may be used to terminate a pregnancy. In these states, our pharmacists work closely with prescribers as needed, to fill lawful, clinically appropriate prescriptions, Fraser Engerman, a company spokesman, said in an email.Such policy changes may be subject to challenge under federal civil rights law, however, because they potentially target people on the basis of sex and disability, argued Matthew Cortland, a senior fellow at Data for Progress, a think tank dedicated to advancing liberal causes, who shared a CVS memo on Twitter.Some doctors also object to pharmacies requiring diagnosis codes for drugs like methotrexate, saying that a forgotten code may lead to delays filling prescriptions for patients with debilitating pain.It becomes a huge problem if we see a patient on Thursday or Friday and we dont get the pharmacy to call back immediately, said Zahabi, the Dallas-based rheumatologist. The patient cant get treatment for three or four days, which can be agonizing.But Poole dismissed such concerns, saying pharmacists have advocated for years for the use of such codes in the interest of patient safety many medical offices already provide them on electronic prescriptions.Elisa Greene, associate professor of pharmacy practice at Belmont University College of Pharmacy, noted that prescribing and filling prescriptions for drugs that can cause birth defects is not a new issue. She contrasted the lack of guidance to doctors and pharmacists handling prescriptions like methotrexate with the tight regimen required by the FDA for those prescribing or dispensing Accutane an acne treatment that can cause birth defects.Doctors and pharmacists, along with their patients regardless of age or gender, are required to enroll in an education program about the drugs potential dangers, she said. And female patients of childbearing age must have negative pregnancy test results before a prescription is filled.That requirement is not in place for methotrexate, Greene wrote in a text message.Living in painFor patients like Hubbard, the concerns are more immediate. She has gone without methotrexate injections for several weeks now, while waiting to see a gynecologist about having a tubal ligation that will prevent her from ever getting pregnant.A week ago, she fell down during her sons birthday celebration because of the pain in her joints. Things have definitely gotten worse, she said. My joints arent doing as well.Hubbard said she wishes she had the foresight to anticipate that Tennessees fetal heartbeat law, which took effect the day after Roes reversal, would have such a big effect on her own life.I knew there would be other things than abortion affected, she said. Never in my life did I think it would be my rheumatoid arthritis medicine.ShareThe U.S. fight over abortionHAND CURATEDStates where abortion is legal, banned or under threatFebruary 28, 2024States where abortion is legal, banned or under threatFebruary 28, 2024In history-making visit, Harris tours Minnesota abortion clinicMarch 14, 2024In history-making visit, Harris tours Minnesota abortion clinicMarch 14, 2024Walgreens, CVS to begin selling abortion pill mifepristone in some statesMarch 1, 2024Walgreens, CVS to begin selling abortion pill mifepristone in some statesMarch 1, 2024View 3 more storiesSign upTOP STORIESPoliticsReporting and analysis from the Hill and the White HouseTrump may enlist Paul Manafort, who was criticized for Russia ties Biden and other Democrats forced to adapt to pro-Palestinian protests AnalysisBloodbath aside, Trumps violent rhetoric is unambiguousbackTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com 1996-2024 The Washington Post","The article discusses how abortion bans in the U.S. are complicating access to medications that are crucial for treating chronic conditions like cancer, arthritis, and ulcers. Medications such as methotrexate, commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, can also be used to end pregnancies or cause birth defects. Following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, doctors, pharmacists, and patients in states with strict abortion laws face new challenges regarding these drugs, which could be criminally linked to abortion or birth defects.

Becky Hubbard, a Tennessee woman with rheumatoid arthritis, faced an ultimatum from her doctor to either go on birth control or stop taking methotrexate, a medication that had significantly alleviated her pain. This situation highlights how new abortion restrictions are affecting patients with chronic health issues, forcing some to consider drastic measures, like sterilization, to continue their treatment. These laws have led to confusion, with some doctors and pharmacists uncertain about their liability when prescribing such medications, even when they are not intended for abortion.

Patient advocates have reported numerous cases where people with conditions like arthritis are encountering difficulty filling prescriptions for methotrexate, especially in states with abortion bans. While medical professionals strive to protect patients, the confusion surrounding state laws creates a barrier to care. Some large pharmacy chains, like CVS and Walgreens, have instructed their pharmacists to verify that prescriptions are not for abortion purposes, which has led to delays and potential risks for patients in need of timely treatment.

The issue is particularly concerning for women, who are more likely to suffer from autoimmune diseases and other conditions that require such medications. Civil rights advocates argue that these restrictions may violate federal protections against sex and disability discrimination. Doctors and medical groups, while sympathetic, are grappling with ethical dilemmas about balancing patient care with legal risks.

Credit Jordan Vonderhaar for The Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Texas is suing the Biden administration over guidance released Monday telling the nations doctors theyre protected by federal law to terminate a pregnancy as part of emergency treatment and threatening to defund hospitals that dont perform these procedures. The Biden administrations guidance states that federal law requires doctors to perform abortions for pregnant people in emergency rooms when it is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve a medical emergency, including treatments for ectopic pregnancy, hypertension and preeclampsia. On Wednesday, the Biden administration also warned retail pharmacies that they must fill prescriptions for pills that can induce abortion or risk violating federal civil rights law. These two recent actions pit the federal executive branch against state governments after the U.S. Supreme Court undid a nearly half-century-old precedent that had affirmed access to abortion as a constitutional right. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtons office filed the suit challenging the guidance in federal court on Thursday, saying the Biden administrations guidance violates the states sovereign interest in the power to create and enforce a legal code. Texas is one of several states with laws banning abortion already in effect or trigger laws that will soon ban the medical procedure. Texas will soon ban all abortions from the moment of fertilization with narrow exceptions only to save the life of a pregnant patient or prevent substantial impairment of major bodily function. The Biden administration reassured the nations doctors that they dont need to wait until a patients health deteriorates before acting and that they can act in cases where nontreatment would result in serious impairment, guidance that comes as medical professionals in Texas and other states where abortion is banned are trying to figure out what kind of womens health care is allowed under new restrictions. The guidance isnt seeking to update existing law but is said to clarify a hospitals duties under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. In no uncertain terms, we are reinforcing that we expect providers to continue offering these services, and that federal law preempts state abortion bans when needed for emergency care, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. Under the law, no matter where you live, women have the right to emergency care including abortion care. The Biden administration warned that if a hospital fails to provide emergency abortion treatment when necessary, it could be fined or have its Medicare status revoked. These hospitals are now threatened with having to choose between violating state law under the threat of criminal penalty or jeopardizing their ability to participate in Medicaid, Paxtons office argued in the suit. Any ruling will likely be appealed. Paxtons office argues that the federal guidance isnt merely clarifying existing law but includes a number of new requirements related to the provision of abortions that do not exist under federal law. This administration has a hard time following the law, and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions, Paxton said in a statement. I will ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Courts important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administrations unlawful agenda. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back on Paxtons suit, emphasizing that the guidance is based on existing law. The Texas Attorney Generals lawsuit is yet another example of an extreme and radical Republican elected official, Jean-Pierre wrote on Twitter. It is unthinkable that this public official would sue to block women from receiving life-saving care in emergency rooms, a right protected under U.S. law.

The guidance, issued by the federal government, states that doctors are protected under federal law to terminate pregnancies in emergency situations where it is necessary for the patient’s stabilization, such as in cases of ectopic pregnancies or severe conditions like hypertension and preeclampsia. It also warns that hospitals failing to provide such emergency abortion care could face penalties or loss of Medicare funding.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argues that the guidance infringes upon the state’s sovereignty by overriding Texas’ abortion laws, which include a near-total ban on abortion. He contends that the Biden administration is creating new legal requirements that did not exist before, and that hospitals are now forced to choose between violating state law or risking federal penalties. Paxton also criticized the administration for trying to mandate abortion procedures in emergency care settings, which he claims is an overreach.

The Biden administration, however, maintains that the guidance merely clarifies existing law under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires hospitals to provide necessary emergency care, including abortions, when needed. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the guidance, arguing that it is based on established law and is intended to protect women’s access to life-saving medical care.

This legal battle comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and states like Texas implemented stricter abortion restrictions. The lawsuit is expected to be appealed, and the outcome could have significant implications for the ongoing debate over abortion access in the U.S."

Impending Threat of Abortion Criminalization Brings New Urgency to the Fight for Digital Privacy | ACLU,"Impending Threat of Abortion Criminalization Brings New Urgency to the Fight for Digital Privacy ACLU Skip navigation Back to News Commentary Impending Threat of Abortion Criminalization Brings New Urgency to the Fight for Digital Privacy As the Supreme Court nears a ruling that could allow abortion to be criminalized by politicians, privacy activists and lawmakers must shift our approach in the states. Kade Crockford, Director, ACLU of Massachusetts Technology for Liberty Project Nathan Freed Wessler, Deputy Director, ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project Share This Page May 17, 2022 As the shockwaves from the bombshell publication of a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade continue to reverberate, questions and fears about our digital privacy and what comes next abound. To be clear Right now, abortion is still legal in this country. But according to the Guttmacher Institute, half the states are certain or likely to ban abortion if the court overturns Roe, and anti-abortion extremists are already pushing for a nationwide ban as soon as they get the chance. All of these roads lead to the same destination the criminalization of people seeking reproductive health care, and of doctors and nurses who seek to provide it. If and when that does happen, our digital privacy will matter more than ever. The lack of strong digital privacy protections has profound implications in the face of expanded criminalization of reproductive health care. In light of these breathtaking and authoritarian attacks on bodily autonomy, we must fight with new urgency to ensure that people maintain control over their personal information. If we fail, the repressive surveillance techniques and powers that police and prosecutors have for decades used to wage the racist wars on drugs and terrorism will be marshaled to track, catalogue, and criminalize pregnant people and those seeking basic information about reproductive health issues, putting tens of millions of people at risk of police harassment and worse. Laws that criminalize reproductive health are already being used by police and prosecutors to surveil, penalize, and control people who are disproportionately Black and Brown. According to the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, the past 15 years have seen a shocking spike in arrests and prosecutions for crimes related to stillbirths, miscarriages, and alleged drug and alcohol use during pregnancy. Of the 1,600 people prosecuted for these offenses since the Roe decision in 1973, 1,200 were charged after 2006, and those targeted were disproportionately Black and Indigenous women. And in March, a Texas district attorney and sheriff conspired to indict and arrest a 26-year-old woman and charge her with murder, after the woman self-managed her abortion. In 2017, an online search for the abortion medication misoprostol was used to charge one woman with second-degree murder. In 2015, a series of text messages with a friend about getting an abortion helped convict another of feticide and child neglect. Expanded criminalization of abortion will become an increasingly attractive target for prosecutors and police, which is why we must be prepared to digitally defend ourselves against corporate and government surveillance. We also must redouble our efforts to push states to take real action to protect our digital privacy. Some states have passed significant law reform in this area already. Over the past 20 years, digital technologies have rapidly advanced, changing the way we communicate, seek and share information, travel, work, play, document and track our own health metrics, find love, and more. Billion-dollar industries have taken shape during this period, working behind the scenes to create, share, trade, and sell extremely sensitive data about hundreds of millions of people, buoyed by leaps in computing power and the declining cost of data storage. Police and prosecutors piggyback on all of this corporate surveillance in what some have called a public-private surveillance partnership. In many cases, the government can obtain extremely detailed information from corporations about peoples finances, internet use, and communications without ever going to a judge, and without a shred of evidence to show someone is involved in criminal activity. When cops are armed with court orders, virtually none of the information collected and processed in what has been called the surveillance capitalist marketplace is off limits to the government. And even for types of personal information, like cell phone location data, that courts have said police can only force companies to turn over with a warrant, government agencies are sidestepping the warrant requirement by paying to access sensitive information instead of going to a judge. Credit Gwen Schroeder In response to these profound transformations, civil rights advocates have pushed for consumer privacy protections to give people control over their personal information. In Illinois, civil rights advocates successfully fought for consumer privacy protections to limit what kinds of information companies can collect about us and the ways they can share and use these data. The ACLU is working across the nation to introduce state legislation to prevent law enforcement from making overly broad requests to try to identify everyone who visited visited a particular location such as an abortion clinic or searched online for particular keywords such as abortion care. In Massachusetts, the abortion rights coalition is calling on the state legislature to pass a law to prevent the sale and trade of cell phone location data, which can be used to track who visits a reproductive health clinic. We have also fought and will continue to fight for statutes and court rulings requiring police to get warrants before using invasive digital surveillance techniques like cell phone location tracking or making demands for our digital papers like emails and private web chats. And in some important cases, we have won these protections. But the criminalization of abortion shines a glaring and unkind light on a bleak reality Even warrant protections will not stop invasive digital surveillance of people seeking or providing abortions if doing so is a crime. Thats because if police can demonstrate probable cause that a person has committed or will commit a crime, they can obtain a search warrant allowing a search of someones most private information the contents of our emails and text messages, our location history, the photos and private chats on our cell phone, and more. As what is considered criminal activity expands to include seeking and providing essential health care, privacy activists and lawmakers must likewise shift our approach. In some cases, police should be prevented from acquiring or using particularly invasive technologies and techniques even with a warrant. In others, legislatures must impose strict limitations on their use, restricting surveillance warrants to only the most serious kinds of criminal investigations, excluding investigations related to sexual health. States that seek to preserve access to abortion should take extreme care to protect information created or maintained in their jurisdictions from being disclosed to out of state officials investigating sexual health related matters. Technology companies should change their internal policies and procedures to ensure that they notify their users of all government requests for their data before turning anything over unless a court order bars them from doing so, giving people a chance to fight back against surveillance aimed at their personal health information. And state legislators should enact strong laws ending nonconsensual collection and sale of sensitive information like location and biometric data, give people more control over how their personal information is collected and used by private companies, and outlaw the use of search word and geofencing warrants, which allow police to conduct dragnet surveillance. Unfortunately, its not likely that the states that adopt abortion bans will be amenable to restricting law enforcements ability to use digital surveillance to investigate and prosecute crimes related to bodily autonomy. That means that while we build the political power we need to defend our ability to control if and when to have a child, itll be up to each of us to protect ourselves and each other. The fact that we are about to take one of the biggest strides backwards in our countrys history should serve as a reminder to us all that we should never accept living in a surveillance society, no matter what technology is used to carry it out. Privacy sits at the heart of democracy, and we must fight like hell to ensure its relevance in 2022 and the decades to come.

Wade. With the possibility of states banning abortion, the authors argue that the criminalization of reproductive health care will be significantly impacted by surveillance technologies that monitor personal data. These technologies could be used to track individuals seeking or providing abortions, as well as those researching reproductive health online.

The lack of strong privacy protections exacerbates this threat, as police and prosecutors already have access to vast amounts of personal data through corporate surveillance. The government often sidesteps legal procedures, such as obtaining warrants, by directly purchasing data from private companies, making it easier to track individuals’ activities without proper oversight. The article highlights alarming cases, such as the prosecution of individuals for seeking abortions or using abortion medication, underscoring the risks posed by these invasive practices.

To combat this, the ACLU and other privacy advocates have been pushing for stronger laws to limit the scope of digital surveillance, including protections against the sale of personal data like cell phone location and search history. Efforts are also underway to ensure that police cannot easily access personal information, such as emails or text messages, through overly broad warrants. States that aim to preserve abortion rights are encouraged to take proactive steps to protect sensitive data from being used in abortion-related investigations.

Ultimately, the article argues that while changes in legislation are essential, individuals must also take responsibility for protecting their digital privacy. The authors warn that as abortion becomes criminalized in some states, surveillance and data collection will be weaponized to control reproductive health, and it is vital to resist living in a surveillance society that undermines privacy and democracy."

WadeBrittany BernsteinSeptember 29, 2020 at 952 PM2 min readLink CopiedRead full articlePro-life Senator Joni Ernst R., Iowa said on Monday that she thinks the likelihood of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that made abortion legal, is very minimal.Ernsts comments during an hour-long debate for the U.S. Senate race against her pro-abortion opponent, Democrat Theresa Greenfield. Moderator David Yepsen asked what each candidate would do if the Court overturned the ruling, which President Trump has suggested may happen now that he has nominated pro-life Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the high court. If confirmed, Barretts appointment would create a 6-3 conservative majority on the Court. Ernst explained that she is proudly pro-life and thinks every life has value and is worthwhile but expressed skepticism that the ruling would be overturned.I think the likelihood of Roe v. Wade being overturned is very minimal. I dont see that happening, truly I dont see that happening, she said.The Iowa Republican went on to say that what pro-lifers can do, in lieu of a Court decision, is educate the public on how important life is.I think that the views that are being taken by Theresa Greenfield and those that are backing her from the coasts, from California and New York, its inappropriate and not acceptable to most Iowa voters, she said. Ernst has supported overturning the ruling in the past, and in January joined 206 other members of Congress in petitioning the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade. Greenfield said she believes abortion rights are settled law.I will always defend a womans right to make her own health care decisions with the guidance of her doctor, she said. Barrett, when asked in 2016 about ways a future Supreme Court might allow states to pass more restrictions on abortion, said she didnt believe the core case behind Roe v. Wade would change.I think dont think the core case Roes core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion I dont think that would change. But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics I think that would change, she said.Greenfield is currently polling 2.6 points ahead of Ernst, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polling totals.Editors Note A previous version of this article identified Theresa Greenfield as anti-abortion, when she is in fact pro-abortion.More from National ReviewPoll 64 Percent of Americans Want to Keep Roe vs. WadeIllinois House Passes Bill Repealing Partial-Birth-Abortion BanNebraska Legislature Passes Ban on Dismemberment Abortions View comments Recommended StoriesYahoo SportsNFL free agency good, bad and ugly How has your favorite team done so far?Which teams should be most excited after a week of NFL free agency?1d agoYahoo SportsPass or Fail Houston Texans show off new road uniforms after Reddit leakTexans CEO and Chairman Cal McNair took to Reddit to show off one of the team's new uniform combinations in response to a leak.17h agoYahoo FinanceThe CEO of Warren Buffett's favorite oil company thinks its stock is 'very undervalued'Occidental Petroleum's CEO said the company will focus on paying off debt for the next couple of years as it puts a pause on aggressive share buybacks.3h agoYahoo SportsMarch Madness Ranking the NCAA men's tournament teams from 1 to 68UConn is the favorite, but there are at least eight others who are legit contenders to cut down the nets in April.2h agoYahoo SportsTimberwolves star Anthony Edwards throws down ridiculous dunk of the year over John Collins in win vs. JazzJohn Collins got put on a wild poster on Monday night, and had to leave the game due to a head injury.14h agoYahoo SportsBaker Mayfield gets called 'a 10 on the pr--- scale' by Bucs GM, then thanks him 'I'll take that'Baker took it as a compliment, even though it didn't really sound like one.6d agoYahoo Sports2024 Fantasy Baseball Jackson Holliday leads 5 key draft sleepers from the infieldDalton Del Don examines potential draft values with the upside to make a difference in fantasy baseball leagues.1d agoYahoo FinanceFed's inflation fight will affect housing supply for decades, says Redfin CEOThe housing market is showing signs of a recovery, but Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman warns higher rates will affect the housing sector for decades.2d agoYahoo SportsNearing a loaded 2024 NFL Draft, Justin Fields and the 2021 QB class remind us the position is a crapshootWhy Fields wasnt scooped by other teams largely centers on his one year of rookie contract control, which features a fifth-year option that will be set at 25.6 million.2d agoYahoo SportsAaron Rodgers says 'Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy' in wake of report he believed in conspiracy theoryRodgers' statement comes a day after a CNN story detailing comments Rodgers made about the shooting in 2013.5d agoYahoo SportsNL East season preview What's in store for the Braves, Phillies, Mets, Marlins and Nationals in 2024?The Braves are aiming for a seventh straight division title.

Along with her colleagues, she was scrambling to file a preliminary injunction on a mandatory ultrasound law that had passed in Kentucky. Without it, abortion providers would be legally forced to show and describe ultrasound images to their patients and play the fetal heart tones prior to performing an abortion, regardless of the patients wishes. A heavy workload wasnt anything new for Burrows she had spent two years at a corporate law firm to pay back student loans but fighting this hard for continued access to abortion care wasnt what she thought shed be doing when she interviewed for the job.I applied to and was interviewing for this job the summer leading up to the election, when many of us anticipated a Clinton presidency, Burrows, 30, tells InStyle. We were discussing all of our plans for proactive work, what we were going to do to expand abortion access, and our vision for a Supreme Court with a seat filled by a Democratic president.Meagan Burrows by Heather Sten.The nature of Burrows potential workload shifted dramatically when Donald Trump was elected, but that didnt scare her off from joining the ACLU.Its not as though the White House flipped and suddenly abortion rights were at stake its a battle that the reproductive rights movement has been waging at the state level for a long time, Burrows says. So when they said, Wed still love to have you if you are still interested in coming well, the refrain that many of us have said in the movement since Trump was elected is Yes. More than ever.RELATED No Matter How You Feel About Abortion, You Need to Better Understand DCAfter taking office, Trump fulfilled his campaign promise to appoint Supreme Court justices whod overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that solidified abortion as a Constitutional right. Then, conservative lawmakers passed a record number of abortion bans.In 2017, 19 states passed 63 laws restricting access to abortion. In 2019, 58 abortion restrictions passed, and 12 states passed some kind of ban. Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio moved to ban abortion at six weeks, before most people even know theyre pregnant, and Alabama passed a total abortion ban. And while none of these have gone into effect abortion is still legal in all 50 states these laws represent a shift in the anti-abortion movements gameplan. Instead of chipping away at access with restrictions, the GOP is putting forward blatantly unconstitutional bills knowing theyll trigger a legal challenge, which they hope will reach the Supreme Court which is now lopsided enough to overturn Roe v Wade.So far, all is going according to their plan. This March, the Supreme Court will hear June Medical Services LLC v Gee, the first abortion case since Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined the bench. The case is being argued by the Center for Reproductive Rights CRR, and if the court rules in favor of the Louisina abortion law that requires providers to acquire hospital admitting privileges which mimics a 2015 Texas law that shut down more than half of the states 42 clinics before being struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016 Roe v Wade will essentially be gutted. And on Jan. 2, 2020, more than 200 members of Congress urged the Supreme Court to instead overturn the decision entirely.Their goal has always been to prevent people from getting abortions, but they had been using this sort of incremental approach, Jen Dalven, 48, Director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, tells InStyle. But when they saw the new Supreme Court Justices they decided to just go for broke.Jennifer Dalven by Heather Sten. Sweater La Ligne.The ACLU is currently handling 17 abortion-related cases at the state and federal levels across the country. The five women interviewed here are waging that fight alone but represent a team of 14 lawyers who make up the RFP. They tell us there is one man on the team, and hes wonderful.It has really hit a fever pitch, Dalven says. But we take a lot of strength from our clients the folks whore fighting these laws on the ground and trying their best to serve their patients in very hostile states the Alabamas and Kentuckys of the world, places where theres real sacrifice on the parts of their professional and personal lives. We have it pretty easy being here in New York City.Of course, what Dalven and her team consider easy is anything but. Theyre working long nights, evenings, and weekends. Theyre missing vacations with family or working during their increasingly rare ""time off."" Theyre missing bedtime routines with their kids, time with friends, and nights with their partners.Brigitte Amiri by Heather Sten.Its been really intense for us, Brigitte Amiri, 45, Deputy Director of the ACLUs RFP, tells InStyle. This is probably the hardest weve all worked at a concentrated period of time. Theres always been an ebb and flow to our work, but now were at a constant flow there hasnt been a lot of downtime. Were just non-stop running breathless, and thats been unusual, to have this kind of onslaught. Amiri, who has a 6-year-old daughter, says she hasnt been around as much as she'd like, and has had to pass on family and friend get-togethers as a result of her caseload. But everyone understands and really supports my work,"" she says. ""I feel very fortunate that I have that support system to be able to do this and hopefully we will have some down time at some point.That down time isnt on the horizon just yet, and thats regardless of what happens in November.Alexa Kolbi-Molinas by Heather Sten. Sweater La Ligne.When theres a Democratic president in office, people assume that everything is going to be fine, and dont really understand that so much of this happens at the state level, Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, 40, Senior Staff Attorney with RFP, tells InStyle. Obviously a president can do bad things were fighting on the federal and state level but it doesnt necessarily get easier or make the fights go away when theres a Democrat in office.Thats because a fight to keep abortion accessible isnt just about keeping Roe v. Wade on the books. It doesnt matter what federal law says if people across the country still cant get the care they need. And many already cant. A reported 90 of counties in the United States do not have an abortion provider, and six states are down to just one provider each. This is largely as a result of TRAP laws, or Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers, which put requirements on clinics that dont have much to do with health or safety such as the layout of a janitors closet. When a provider cant afford to comply, they are forced to shut down.I think Kentucky is a perfect example of what happens in a state where the attacks have been just one on top of another, Amiri says. Shortly after Roe was decided in 1973, there were 17 places where you could get an abortion in Kentucky. Now, theres only one and theyre our client, EMW Womens Surgical Center.The preliminary injunction the newly hired Burrows and her colleagues filed in January of 2017 was on behalf of EMW against a TRAP law. A federal trial judge struck down the law, but it was upheld in the court of appeals. On the day InStyle interviewed the RFP team, the Supreme Court announced that it wouldnt hear the case, allowing the law to immediately go into effect.The lawyers were tasked with the heartbreaking job of calling their clients and telling them that now, in Kentucky, abortion providers must administer medically unnecessary ultrasounds, show those ultrasounds to their patients, describe them, and play fetal heart tones even if their patients say no. They did this while each awaiting their turn in the hair and makeup chair, before and after sitting for these photos.Its really rough to have to explain to a clinic what theyre going to have to do now for nonsensical reasons for political reasons that have nothing to do with science and medicine, Amiri says. And as health care providers their first response is, Why? Why do we have to do something that has nothing to do with making sure our patients get the care that they need? And that disconnect between what health care providers know to be true and the politics of it is just really hard to have to live with and to break the news.The team wins more cases than it loses, though. So any disappointment in defeat, while palpable, is swiftly followed by action.Elizabeth Watson by Heather Sten.We prepare for these things all the time, so even though were disappointed that the Supreme Court didnt take up this case, we knew that it was a possibility, Lizzy Watson, 31, Staff Attorney with RFP, tells InStyle. Most patients just want care, so even though they have to jump through all these hoops to get it, theyre going to do what they have to do. Were just trying to minimize the effect on them.The team has also found ways to de-stress, refocus and reprioritize as they move on from a disappointing ruling and look toward the many cases ahead.I meditate every day, Watson says. Kolbi-Molinas says she leaves the house at 730 every morning to swim before work.Its such a labor-intensive job, Watson continues. So making sure we appreciate each other and making sure we all hear from each other is important. And of course, for every lawyer on the team, perspective helps.Im not a martyr and Im not a workaholic, and I also recognize that there are people on the front lines of this battle that have such a higher level of stress in their life, Amiri says. So I put things into perspective and I appreciate the support system and the other ways that Im able to do my job and still sleep and see my kid.By the end of our day on set its clear the team shares that almost-frustrating level of humility. In moments of intense stress or letdowns that would seem heartbreaking, they buck up and keep at it.There are so many other people who are part of this ecosystem, Amiri says. There are the abortion funds that make sure people who dont have enough money can access abortion whether its for travel, child care, paying for the abortion itself. There are the volunteers outside the clinic who make sure patients can get in without being harassed by protestors. We all work really hard to make sure people arent going to go without care in these crisis moments.RELATED Women Can Be Denied Entry to the U.S. for Looking Pregnant, According to New Trump Rule But in many parts of the country people already are going without care, and Black, brown, and poor people bear the brunt of that crisis. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Black and Hispanic people are more likely to experience unintended pregnancy than white people, due in no small part to a lack of contraception access and hurdles to reproductive health care. For Watson, whose Black father and white mother met in a Louisiana high school shortly after schools began integrating, and who left the state to find a home where theyd feel safe, it is the ability to serve these communities that fuels her tireless work.I wanted the movement to be more representative of the people that were serving, she says. And its very important to me to be in the reproductive justice spaces where were taking about all the things that the community needs, that Black people need and Black women need and Black families need, and not just abortion.The ACLU lawyers of the Reproductive Freedom Project all had incredibly different plans heading into the 2016 election. From expanding access to care to working with a more liberal-leaning Supreme Court, the future they envisioned on Nov. 7, 2016, in no way included a flagrant assault on the Consitutional right to access abortion care. As a result, its difficult for many of them to even take a shot at envisioning the future now.I cant imagine how busy its going to be in 2020, Watson says. Because it was so busy in 2019. From flying to various states to meet with the abortion providers they represent, to filing emergency briefs for individual immigrant women in need of care, the work was overwhelming and emotionally taxing. But Watson says that because its work in which theyre wholeheartedly invested morally, ethically, professionally, and politically its work they gladly run toward.How can they possibly make it worse than it already is for patients? Watson continues. I mean, thats not a challenge please dont try. But the Constitution is the floor not the ceiling, and states are always trying to lower the floor.And now, in 2020, anti-abortion lawmakers in those same states are working to demolish the floor entirely. Passing as many abortion restrictions as possible is a noted Republican goal for 2020, so the ACLU is responding accordingly. The team is preparing for the first hearing for the Womens Health Protection Act on Feb. 12 an effort from the CRR as part of the Act for Women Campaign, arguing at the 9th circuit on the Title X case on Feb. 27, arguing at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on an Ohio law March 11, and preparing to file an AMICUS brief in an upcoming Supreme Court birth control case sometime in April.We are so privileged to work at an organization that enables us to be able to say, Whatever you need that lawyers can do, we are going to do it, Kolbi-Molinas says. Our clients work is so important, and what theyre up against on a daily basis regardless of who is in office, regardless of whats happening at their state legislatures is so heroic.""To be clear, this work is done in service of what the majority of American people want and need. Support for abortion is the highest it has been in nearly two decades 71 of American voters support Roe v Wade and dont want it overturned. For the lawyers fighting against party politics, laws being passed in opposition of the will of the people is infuriating. I am someone who is often filled with rage, as they say, Kolbi-Molinas says. But its motivating.And as for Burrows, who is beginning her fourth year as an ACLU lawyer, as she hopes Trump begins his final year in office, the teams successes are just as motivating as their righteous indignation.I would say what pushes us forward is that we are winning a lot, despite what is happening in the world, despite the fact that it feels like sometimes were fighting an uphill battle and as soon as we get one law blocked theres another crazy law on the table that makes no medical sense and is completely contrary to judicial precedent, she says. But we are winning.Photographs by Heather Sten, assisted by Flaminia Fanale. Hair by Yohey Nakatsuki. Makeup by Angela Davis Deacon.

The lawyers’ work is focused on challenging restrictive abortion laws at both the state and federal levels, with many of these laws designed to trigger a legal challenge that could lead to overturning Roe v. Wade. These cases often involve laws such as mandatory ultrasounds, abortion bans at six weeks, and TRAP (Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers) laws, which impose stringent and non-medical requirements on clinics, forcing many to close.

One key case discussed is June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, where the Supreme Court could rule on a Louisiana law that mirrors a Texas law previously struck down. If upheld, this law could pave the way for Roe v. Wade to be undermined significantly. The ACLU’s team, which includes lawyers like Meagan Burrows, Jen Dalven, Brigitte Amiri, Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, and Elizabeth Watson, is working tirelessly on these cases, often at great personal sacrifice. They note that while many people think abortion access is secure with a Democratic president, the battle continues largely at the state level.

The article also highlights the emotional toll this work takes on the lawyers, including missing time with family and personal milestones. Yet, they remain motivated by their clients’ courage and the significance of their work, knowing the majority of Americans support abortion rights. The lawyers also stress the importance of a broader reproductive justice movement that addresses the needs of Black and Hispanic communities, which disproportionately suffer from restrictions on abortion access. Despite the challenges, the team is determined to continue fighting for reproductive rights in what is expected to be a critical period for abortion laws in the U.S."

Photograph Kasia StrekMass demonstrations have exposed underlying anger at political and religious interference in peoples everyday livesby Jon Henley, Europe correspondent, and Kasia Strek in WarsawFri 6 Nov 2020 14.28 CETLast modified on Tue 10 Nov 2020 19.12 CETShareFor 14 nights they have marched, enraged by a near-total ban on abortion that has stirred a generation to stage the largest mass demonstrations that Poland has seen since Solidarno toppled the communist regime in the 1980s.Until soaring coronavirus numbers and a looming national lockdown made it almost impossible, up to a million people nightly defied a government ban on protests, taking to the streets from Warsaw to d, Pozna to Wrocaw, Gdask to Krakw.The protests, led by the grassroots womens movement Oglnopolski Strajk Kobiet OSK, or All-Polish Womens Strike, have shocked the ruling conservatives and created a new political faultline that, analysts say, could spell more serious problems for the party.I think it is a whole backlash against a patriarchal culture, against the patriarchal state, against the fundamentalist religious state, against the state that treats women really badly, said Marta Lempart, a 41-year-old lawyer and one of OSKs leaders.View image in fullscreenMarta Lempart calls for the liberalisation of abortion, establishment of sex education classes and universal access to contraception during a rally in front of parliament in Warsaw on 27 October.

Photograph Kasia StrekPredominantly Catholic Poland already had one of Europes strictest abortion laws when, on 22 October, its constitutional tribunal ruled that terminations in instances of severe foetal anomalies, which accounted for all but about 30 of the 1,110 abortions performed legally in Poland last year, were incompatible with the constitution.The decision by the courts 15 pro-PiS judges, many of them appointed unlawfully, would allow terminations only in instances of rape, incest and when the mothers life is at risk a tiny fraction of cases. Womens groups estimate an additional 200,000 Polish women have abortions either illegally or abroad each year.The ruling sparked an immediate reaction. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, mainly women and young people, took to the streets with banners proclaiming I wish I could abort my government, This is war and Womens hell.View image in fullscreenProtesters holding anti-PiS signs. Photograph Kasia StrekOn Tuesday apparently in response to the protests the government indefinitely postponed publishing the courts decision in the official journal, preventing it from coming into effect and raising major constitutional questions if it tries to do so later.But the genie may be out of the bottle.While surveys show more than 60 of Poles support the status quo on abortion, barely 15 back the proposed changes. This has mobilised a generation not previously engaged with politics and stoked existing, wider anger at what many see as the steady erosion of democratic norms since PiS came to power in 2015.Maria Kowalczyk, 38, a beauty journalist, said at a protest in Warsaw that Poland was years behind. In this country, because of the politics and doctrine of the government and the religious fanatics, someone who is different is worse. The way they treat LGBT people, migrants, all minorities and now women Society has had enough.View image in fullscreenMaria Kowalczyk,who has two children and lost two through stillbirth and miscarriage, says Forcing a mother to give birth to a baby without an organ is simply insane.

We are a religious state where we are all demanded to think in one possible way. Bianka, 15, and Maja, 16, said Polands youth would not back down. We dont want to live in a country where we dont have a choice, where everything is decided for us.View image in fullscreenJulia Estera at a protest in Warsaw on 30 October. Photograph Kasia StrekAndrzej Kompa, a historian and university researcher, said on another march in the capital that he was protesting not just against this hell for women, decided by this so-called constitutional court, but against this government, against church involvement in political affairs, for minority rights. Simply for freedom.Support for the PiS, who were re-elected last year, and its founder, Jarosaw Kaczyski, 71, has plunged by almost 10 points to 30.9 in a month, according to one poll. Another showed 70 of Poles would like Kaczyski widely seen as the countrys true powerbroker to step down as PiS leader.Breaking long-held taboos, the protests have also challenged the Catholic church and its influence on Polish policy, education and culture, with some demonstrators disrupting services and defacing churches. Support for the church has fallen eight points to 49 since March, one poll showed.View image in fullscreenA woman covering her ears as she passes the Church of the Holy Cross, in Warsaw, where Catholic fundamentalists, flanked by nationalist militias and separated from protesters by police and military officers, were playing the cries of newborns through loudspeakers. Photograph Kasia StrekKaczyski last week urged the party faithful to call for a defence of the Catholic church at all costs. He also said the protests were intended to destroy Poland, and urged his supporters to fight for Poland and patriotism in order to avert the end of the Polish nation as we know it.The protests could hardly have come at a worse time for PiS. As Covid-19 infections and death tolls break new records, the government which warned this week of a new national lockdown within 10 days unless things improve is coming under increasingly heavy fire for its handling of the pandemic.It now appears to have few easy ways out. Many Poles view the court ruling as a tactical play by Kaczyski to bolster support on the traditionalist right while bypassing parliament, where the ruling coalition has only a slender majority. It has sparked an explosion of popular fury unlike any PiS has seen.View image in fullscreenA protester holding a banner saying This is war. Photograph Kasia StrekIt certainly feels different, said Adam Mrozowicki, a sociologist at the University of Wrocaw. We need to study it properly, but the heart of this does seem to be young people. Anecdotally, Ive never seen this level of engagement among my students in my faculty, maybe 70-80 of students have taken part in some kind of protest.The scale and nature of the protests was new, Mrozowicki said They are led by young women. This is decentralised, locally based, grassroots. And personally, in 20 years, Ive never seen anything like these numbers. To have 65,000 people on the streets of Wrocaw Ben Stanley, a political scientist at the SWPS university in Warsaw, said the protests felt qualitatively different. Previous anti-PiS demonstrations over the rule of law mainly drew Solidarno-era protesters, people in their 50s and 60s. It wasnt an issue that resonated so much with young people.View image in fullscreenArtists and dancers protesting in Warsaw on 30 October. Photograph Kasia StrekWomens rights are a lot more tangible for 25-year-olds they really mean something concrete. This ruling has animated many more people by personalising the culture war PiS has declared its chosen narrative of a Poland whose authentic identity and traditions are at threat from rootless cosmopolitanism.The protests had blown a hole in the idea that Kaczyski is always three steps ahead, that PiS always has its finger on the pulse of what Poland really feels, Stanley said, at the same time as Covid has blown a hole in their reputation for competence.The party could salvage the situation in the short term, he said, but processes are accelerating that will make the nationalist, clericalist PiS narrative more difficult to sustain longer term. All this may not bring PiS down immediately, but it could make things a lot more difficult in future.Mrozowicki said it was unclear how the protests would immediately affect Polands politics because the protesters had no clear links to parliamentary politics, and their leaders have said they do not want to become a political movement. But it feels like something, definitely, is shifting, he said.

This decision, which only permits abortions in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk, has mobilized mass demonstrations, mainly led by the grassroots women’s group Ogólnopolski Strajk Kobiet (All-Polish Women’s Strike). The protests, which have drawn up to a million people nightly, reflect broader societal anger at the patriarchal, religiously influenced state and the erosion of democratic freedoms under the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS).

While abortion rights were the primary trigger, the protests also call for wider reforms, including stronger women’s and LGBTQ+ rights, separation of church and state, and improvements in healthcare, education, and judicial independence. The protests have disrupted Polish society, challenging the Catholic Church’s political influence and drawing attention to the government’s increasing authoritarianism.

The PiS, which has seen a decline in support due to both the controversial ruling and its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, is facing growing opposition. Public support for PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński has significantly dropped. The protests have especially resonated with younger people, with many seeing the ruling as a symbolic attack on individual freedoms and human rights. Sociologists note that the scale and youth-driven nature of these protests are unprecedented in modern Polish political movements.

Although there is no clear political leadership behind the protests, the events have shifted public sentiment, exposing cracks in the PiS’s previously strong narrative of national identity rooted in traditionalism and Catholicism.

KRDO -- Family Fun Night at the Rocky Mountain Vibes Baseball game, sponsored by Save The Storks, a group whose mission is ""to reimagine the pro-life movement,"" was cancelled Friday night shortly before the game was set to start. In a statement on their Facebook page, Save The Storks said in part quote, ""The Save the Storks events and concert with Matt Hammitt and his son Bowen have been CANCELLED. We were just informed by Vibes management that they cannot allow our pro-family non-profit ministry to be a sponsor."" Though the Vibes stadium is sponsored by UCHealth, the nonprofit health care system said they had nothing to do with the decision to cancel the event. ""UCHealth was not involved in this decision. In fact, we were under the impression that the event was moving forward, and we were surprised to see the post on social media from Save the Storks stating their event was canceled,"" UCHealth representative Cary Vogrin said. Aaron Griffith, the Assistant General Manager for the Rocky Mountain Vibes, issued this statement to KRDO about the abrupt cancellation ""The Rocky Mountain Vibes pulled out of a partnership with an organization that was scheduled to sponsor August 26ths Friday Night Fireworks show. While we value all our sponsors and ticket holders, they do not make decisions regarding the nature of our post game entertainment, or groups that come out to our stadium to raise awareness for their causes. The Vibes made this decision after seeing the proposed assets from the partner in question because they felt that the partner would hinder the teams mission in providing fun and affordable family entertainment. Any statement placing blame on any outside party for cancellation of those events is inaccurate. The Vibes made this decision internally and stand by their choice.

Bill Lees wish to make Tennessee one of the most pro-life states in America, it is anything but.If every life is as precious and the state has a responsibility to protect it as Lee claims, he would not be failing to enact appropriate COVID-19 precautions throughout Tennessee, now a virus hot spot.He would not sign legislation banning access to necessary health care services like abortion, as he did on July 13.And he would go further than extending a reprieve through the end of the year to Harold Wayne Nichols, originally scheduled to be executed on Aug. 4, as he did on July 17. Lees stance on life is contradictoryHow can you say every life is precious, including a potential life in utero, yet electrocute a fellow human to death? The COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the health and welfare of nearly 7 million people living in Tennessee, has stalled Nichols execution. But it has not stopped it. Yet Lee has the power to do so.As a moral philosopher and bioethicist, I am disappointed by the incoherence of Lees policies. The Republican party has long chosen rhetoric over rationality in claiming a pro-life mantle for themselves, despite promoting an agenda incongruent with health-care justice, civil rights, and human rights. The only coherence in the policies Lee enacts and upholds, which deny Tennesseans basic goods necessary for life, and sometimes life itself, is their consistency with an illogical conservative agenda.Lee is not one of my students who I can coach toward better logic and more thoughtful arguments. But Harold Wayne Nichols is. For five years I have been an educator on Tennessees death row.Almost six years ago, I had an abortion in Tennessee. Now Lee is going to tell me that I cannot self-determine my own health choices and terminate a pregnancy if necessary for my life and well-being. Yet Lee can, in the name of the state of Tennessee, allow adult humans to be terminated.I thought every life was precious, and the state has a responsibility to protect it.The governor should make use of his own policiesIn January Lee amended the clemency process as part of his criminal justice reform agenda. The intent was to make clemency, which could take the form of pardon, exoneration or commutation, more accessible to those incarcerated in Tennessee. To commute a sentence is not to remove guilt or responsibility. It is not a pardon or exoneration. It does not indicate forgiveness or remove blame. It changes the punishment associated with a guilty verdict, such as modifying a death sentence to life in prison.Hear more Tennessee Voices Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.To date, Lee has not commuted a single death sentence. Three men have been executed during his tenure as Governor. With two other executions already scheduled for early 2021, Nichols could be the fourth, fifth or sixth execution in Tennessee during Lees governorship.Some will believe Nichols must die in order to respect his victims life. Some will say I murdered an unborn baby. If this were true then every murder charge should be a capital charge, and I should be on death row right along with Nichols.Commute sentences of death row prisonersIf every life is precious, why not commute Nicholss sentence? And those of Byron Black and Oscar Franklin Smith, who have set execution dates as well?If Tennessee is to be among the most pro-life states in America, it must stop killing at the hands of the state, and it must stop infringing on the health and well-being of its women and girls.Elizabeth Lanphier, PhD, MS facilitates the REACH Coalition reciprocal education and community healing class at Riverbend Maximum Security Prison, composed of insider incarcerated students and outsider volunteer educators from across Nashville.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Tennessean Store Licensing Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventsSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events 2024 All rights reserved.","In this opinion piece, Elizabeth Lanphier critiques Tennessee Governor Bill Lee’s stance on the death penalty, arguing that it contradicts his professed pro-life beliefs. Lanphier, a bioethicist and educator at Riverbend Maximum Security Prison, contends that if Lee truly wanted Tennessee to be the most pro-life state in the U.S., he would take more decisive action to protect all lives, including those on death row. She points out that Lee’s actions, such as not enacting sufficient COVID-19 precautions, signing abortion restrictions, and failing to commute death sentences, reveal an incoherent pro-life stance.

Lanphier questions how Lee can advocate for the sanctity of life, especially regarding unborn children, while allowing state-sanctioned executions. She calls for Lee to use his clemency power to commute death sentences, arguing that this is consistent with a truly pro-life agenda. Lanphier emphasizes that commuting a sentence does not absolve guilt but is a moral and ethical decision that aligns with the notion of valuing all human life.

She concludes by asserting that Tennessee’s commitment to being a pro-life state must include the cessation of state executions and the protection of women’s health and rights."

As the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, sweeps through the world in what the World Health Organization WHO has categorized as a pandemic, health systems are racing to respond and countries and communities are taking unprecedented measures to contain the spread of the virus. The WHO is leading the global effort to detect, prevent, and respond to the pandemic, helping countries especially those most at risk prepare with essential supplies, guidance, and data, while helping accelerate worldwide efforts to develop vaccines, tests, and treatments. While this pandemic affects us all, girls and women face unique challenges. When crisis strikes and health care systems falter, inequalities are compounded, our specific needs are deprioritized, and we face additional barriers to care, particularly sexual and reproductive health care. These impacts will be magnified for the millions of girls and women around the world who already live in crisis or conflict zones, and for those are already marginalized. We are also critical in the response Women represent 70 of the health and social sector workforce globally. We must protect the health and rights of frontline women health workers while ensuring we do not leave the most vulnerable of us behind. The UN system, together with global NGOs and care providers, is working to meet girls and womens specific sexual and reproductive health and rights needs in the midst of the outbreak, including by Supporting maternal care, pregnancy, and breastfeeding The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA, the UN agency dedicated to reproductive health, has been working hand-in-hand with the broader UN system to address COVID-19 and the specific impact on girls and women, including those of reproductive age and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. While there is limited evidence on specific risks for pregnant and breastfeeding people, UNFPA has issued guidance for pregnant people to follow all the same preventative actions as adults, as recommended by the WHO, and for breastfeeding parents who may be symptomatic to continue feeding but take special precautions, such as wearing a mask. UNFPA continues to be a leading and in some cases, the only provider of reproductive health care in 150 countries, including those impacted by existing humanitarian crises which will be exacerbated by the pandemic.While fear and uncertainty are natural responses to the coronavirus, we must be guided by facts and solid information, said Dr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of UNFPA. We must stand together in solidarity, fight stigma and discrimination, and ensure that people get the information and services they need, especially pregnant and lactating women. Ensuring continued contraceptive access Globally, more than 214 million women want to prevent pregnancy but are not using modern contraception. In addition to impacting access to health care for contraceptive counseling and procurement, the pandemic is also disrupting the supply chain for contraception, experts say. DKT International, one of the largest providers of family planning products in the world, reports that many contraceptive manufacturers in China are not back to full capacity after shuttering factories or reducing hours during the height of the countrys infections. Supply of raw materials, like progesterone, a critical hormone used in many contraceptive options, are also impacted, and some manufacturers are now forced to source from new suppliers. DKT has already seen stock-outs of contraceptive implants in Myanmar, and is anticipating a condom shortage in Mozambique, for example.The UNFPA Supplies Programme, which supports countries in strengthening their contraceptive supply chains, is working rapidly to ensure a secure and reliable supply of reproductive health commodities, including contraception but also sanitary items and personal protective equipment for health workers. UNFPA Supplies is working with country focal points to identify and propose solutions to specific weaknesses in the supply chain and assist governments securing necessary commodities to serve girls and women in their communities. Protecting hygiene, dignity, and safety Just as pregnancy doesnt pause in a pandemic, neither do periods. But hygiene and dignity needs are often overshadowed by efforts to fulfill other essential needs like food, water, and shelter and, in a health crisis, access to care. In Hubei Province in China, the epicenter of the virus, UNFPA has delivered critical medical supplies and sanitary items such as sanitary napkins and diapers for frontline health workers, girls, and women and their children to protect their health and maintain their dignity in the midst of response.Meanwhile, pandemics exacerbate existing gender inequalities and vulnerabilities, and girls and women are likely to have an even greater need for protection from gender-based and intimate partner violence, according to CARE, which saw similar needs spike during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks. But, support for those experiencing violence may also be cut off. As part of its COVID-19 response, UNFPA helps national partners and health workers effectively address the increased risk of gender-based violence, including how to respond with sensitivity and respect and how to navigate shifting referral pathways as access to care evolves with the outbreak.The protection needs of women and girls must be at the center of response efforts. Part of why we are doing this is to ensure there is a focus on sustaining the accessibility of vulnerable women and girls to quality sexual and reproductive health services as part of the response, said Dr. Babatunde Ahonsi, UNFPA Representative in China. And this is all just the tip of the iceberg we know that the gendered implications of the COVID-19 pandemic extend beyond sexual and reproductive health, and that the full scope of impact is just beginning to reveal itself. As health systems around the world come under unprecedented strain, and the consequences of the pandemic continue to unfold, we must support governments, NGO partners, and the UN in including the specific needs of girls and women in their response. No one country can fight the COVID-19 pandemic alone Now, individuals and organizations can join the fight through the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which supports the WHOs efforts to track and understand the spread of the virus ensure patients get the care they need and frontline workers get essential supplies and information and accelerate efforts to develop vaccines, tests, and treatments.

As COVID-19 spreads globally, health systems are overwhelmed, and the needs of women and girls, particularly those in crisis or conflict zones, are often deprioritized. This worsens existing inequalities and creates additional barriers to accessing essential sexual and reproductive healthcare services.

Key points discussed in the blog include:
	1.	Challenges for Women and Girls: Women, particularly those on the frontline as healthcare workers, face unique challenges. The pandemic exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, such as gender-based violence and limited access to reproductive health care. Many women live in humanitarian crises that are further compounded by the pandemic.
	2.	UNFPA’s Role: The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is playing a critical role in ensuring that the specific needs of women and girls are met during the pandemic. This includes providing guidance on maternal care, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and ensuring the continued access to contraceptives. The pandemic has disrupted contraceptive supply chains, and UNFPA is working to stabilize these supply chains in 150 countries.
	3.	Impact on Hygiene and Safety: With the focus on essential needs like food and shelter, hygiene and dignity needs, particularly for menstrual care, are often overlooked. UNFPA has been delivering sanitary items to frontline workers and communities, particularly in regions like Hubei Province in China. The pandemic also increases the risk of gender-based violence, with services to support victims being disrupted. UNFPA is working with national partners to address these challenges.
	4.	Global Solidarity: The pandemic highlights the interconnectedness of nations and the need for global cooperation. The WHO is leading efforts to control the virus, and individuals and organizations are encouraged to support the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to help fund the WHO’s work.

The blog emphasizes that as the pandemic evolves, the gendered implications are becoming more evident. Women and girls must be included in all response efforts to ensure their health and safety are prioritized. The situation demands urgent collective action to support vulnerable populations during this crisis."

AP PhotoLM Otero By AMANDA SEITZ Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print WASHINGTON AP One woman had to carry her baby, missing much of her skull, for months knowing shed bury her daughter soon after she was born. Another started mirroring the life-threatening symptoms that her baby was displaying while in the womb. An OB-GYN found herself secretly traveling out of state to abort her wanted pregnancy, marred by the diagnosis of a fatal fetal anomaly. All of the women were told they could not end their pregnancies in Texas, a state that has enacted some of the nations most restrictive abortion laws. Now, theyre asking a Texas court to put an emergency hold on some abortion restrictions, joining a lawsuit launched earlier this year by five other women who were denied abortions in the state, despite pregnancies they say endangered their health or lives.More than a dozen Texas women in total have joined the Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit against the states law, which prohibits abortions unless a mothers life is at risk an exception that is not clearly defined. Texas doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to 100,000, leaving many women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy. Our hope is that it will allow physicians at least a little more comfort when it comes to patients in obstetrical emergencies who really need an abortion where its going to effect their health, fertility or life going forward, Molly Duane, the lead attorney on the case, told The Associated Press. Almost all of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit tell similar stories about their doctors saying, if not for this law, Id give you an abortion right now. READ MORE Supreme Court extends block on Texas law that would allow police to arrest migrants South Carolina, Iowa, USC and Texas are the top seeds in the womens NCAA Tournament Florida reaches SEC final rallying from 18 down to beat Texas AM 95-90 The Texas attorney generals office, which is defending the state in the lawsuit, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Monday. The lawsuit serves as a nationwide model for abortion rights advocates to challenge strict new abortion laws states that have rolled out since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Sixteen states, including Texas, do not allow abortions when a fatal fetal anomaly is detected while six do not allow exceptions for the mothers health, according to an analysis by KFF, a health research organization. fd52425b61c1466c9faa1686dcd88d9d Duane said the Center for Reproductive Rights is looking at filing similar lawsuits in other states, noting that theyve heard from women across the country. Roughly 25 Texas women have contacted the organization about their own experiences since the initial lawsuit was filed in March.The women who joined the lawsuit describe being elated about finding out they were pregnant before the experience turned catastrophic. Jessica Bernardo and her husband spent years trying to conceive, even consulting fertility doctors, before finally become pregnant with a daughter, Emma, last July. Almost immediately, Bernardo was coughing so hard and often she would sometimes throw up. Fourteen weeks into the pregnancy, test results revealed her baby likely had Down Syndrome, so she consulted a specialist who gave her devastating news Emmas heart was underdeveloped and she had a rare, deadly disorder called fetal anasarca, which causes fluid to build up in the body. He handed me a tissue box, recalled Bernardo, who lives in Frisco, Texas. I thought maybe the worst thing he was going to tell us was that shes going to have Down Syndrome. Instead, he said, I can tell you right away.she wouldnt make it. The doctor warned her to watch out for high blood pressure and coughing, symptoms of Mirror syndrome, another rare condition where a mother mirrors the same problems the fetus is experiencing. With Bernardos blood pressure numbers climbing, her OB-GYN conferred with the hospitals ethics board to see if she could end the pregnancy but was advised Bernardo wasnt sick enough. Bernardo spent 7,000 traveling to Seattle for an abortion a week later. Even if Emma made it through the pregnancy, doctors would have immediately needed to drain excess fluids from her body, only for her to survive a few hours or days, Bernardo said. Reading about everything they would do sounded like complete torture to a newborn that would not survive, she said. Had I not received an abortion, my life would have very likely been on the line.Other women facing similar situations have not had the financial resources to travel outside of the state. Samantha Casiano, a 29-year-old living in eastern Texas, found out halfway through her pregnancy last year that her daughter, Halo, had a rare diagnosis of anencephaly, where much of the skull and brain is missing. Her doctor told her she would have to continue with the pregnancy because of Texas law, even though her baby would not survive. With five children, including a goddaughter, at home she quickly realized she could not afford an out-of-state trip for an abortion. The next next few months of her pregnancy were spent trying to raise money for her daughters impending funeral, soliciting donations through online websites and launching fundraisers to sell Mexican soup. Halo was born in April, living for only four hours. I was so full of heartbreak and sadness, all at the same time, Casiano said. Women in the lawsuit say they could not openly discuss abortion or labor induction with their doctors, instead asking their doctors discreetly if they should travel outside of the state. Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, never talked about her own abortion with her doctors after they discovered anencephaly on the babys ultrasound during her third pregnancy last year. She worried her out-of-state trip to end the pregnancy could jeopardize her medical license or invite harassment against her and her husband, also an OB-GYN. Dennard was inspired to go public with her case when one of her own patients joined the original lawsuit filed in March after traveling to Colorado to abort a twin fetus diagnosed with a life-threatening genetic disorder. There was an enormous amount of fear that I experienced afterward, Dennard said. Its an additional way of feeling silenced. You feel you have to do it in secret and not tell anyone about it.Dennard is expecting another child later this year. Associated Press writer Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report. AMANDA SEITZ Seitz is an Associated Press reporter covering federal health care policy. She is based in Washington, D.C. mailto","A group of Texas women is suing the state over its restrictive abortion laws, seeking an emergency block on regulations that prevent abortion access even in cases of fatal fetal anomalies or health risks. The lawsuit, which includes over a dozen women, challenges Texas’ abortion law that only allows abortions if a mother’s life is at risk—though this exception is vaguely defined. Many women have reported that their doctors refused to perform abortions, even when the fetus was diagnosed with conditions that would result in death shortly after birth or pose serious health risks to the mother.

Some women were forced to travel out of state for abortions, with many unable to afford such trips. One woman, Jessica Bernardo, traveled to Seattle for an abortion after her baby was diagnosed with a fatal condition, while another woman, Samantha Casiano, was forced to carry a fetus with anencephaly, knowing it would not survive. Doctors in Texas have also expressed concerns about the law’s vagueness, fearing legal repercussions for providing abortions.

This lawsuit is part of a broader effort by abortion rights advocates to challenge restrictive abortion laws across the U.S. following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Center for Reproductive Rights, which is leading the case, plans to file similar lawsuits in other states where women face similar challenges."

Above, the U.S. Supreme Court. Bill ClarkCQ Roll Call file photo By Sandhya Raman and Todd Ruger Posted February 24, 2022 at 204pm Facebook Twitter Email Reddit The Texas Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday on a state abortion law that has blocked almost all abortions since September, and most justices refrained from comments criticizing the restrictions. All nine of the justices are Republicans, making it likely they will rule in favor of the state law. The arguments came days before the Senate intends to hold a cloture vote on a broad abortion rights bill that Democrats say is necessary to provide federal abortion protections due to laws like the Texas ban. The Texas law, known as SB 8, blocks nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy using a legal maneuver that empowers citizens to enforce the ban. Any person can challenge someone suspected of aiding in an abortion. The plaintiff would receive a minimum 10,000 bounty if the defendant is found guilty. The unusual legal mechanism has allowed the broad abortion restriction to be in effect since September 2021 as the case moves through the legal process. In a separate case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit on Tuesday upheld a lower court decision temporarily blocking a South Carolina law with a six-week abortion ban. It has been facing litigation since it was signed into law in February 2021 and does not use the same legal maneuver as the Texas ban. The Texas law has also faced multiple legal challenges from abortion rights advocates, and it has led to a tangle of procedural questions that are still being unraveled. An attorney for Texas told the states highest court Thursday that it could decide the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong in December when it gave abortion providers a narrow legal pathway to challenge a Texas law that effectively bars procedures after about six weeks of pregnancy. Judd Stone of the Texas Solicitor Generals Office told the Texas Supreme Court that the state law was written in a way that meant there could be no lawsuits against state officials who tried to stop the law before it took effect. The problem with that argument, as one member of the Texas Supreme Court pointed out right after Stone made that point, is that eight justices on the Supreme Court didnt think that. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in December that challenges could move forward against some state licensing officials, although it also ruled 5-4 that the challenges could not move forward against state judges and clerks. Abortion providers lawsuits are against state officials who may or must take enforcement actions against the petitioners if the petitioners violate the terms of Texas Health and Safety Code, including the abortion law. When the Supreme Court sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, that court decided to send the case to the Texas Supreme Court for more clarity on what the state law means. Stone told the Texas Supreme Court on Thursday that five members of the U.S. Supreme Court basically said Texas courts are free to agree or disagree on their interpretation. Texas Supreme Court Justice Debra Lehrmann told Stone that the Supreme Court ruling is certainly not something were going to thumb our nose at. Stone then said the Texas high court has made stronger commitments to interpret statutes using the text of the law, known as textualism, than the U.S. Supreme Court has. And upon further review, the Texas court could decide the highest court in the land simply was incorrect. There are several members of the United States Supreme Court who are not so committed, and that court is sometimes fairly described as the fair-weather textualist bench, Stone said. This one is not. So thats a meaningful difference. One Texas justice asked a follow-up about Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who wrote the Supreme Courts opinion in December and considers himself a textualist. Justice Gorsuch is a fair-weather textualist? Texas Supreme Court Justice Evan A. Young asked, eliciting laughter from the bench from at least one other justice. Stone replied I was speaking of the body. I dont think that Justice Gorsuch is a fair-weather textualist, Stone continued. I think hes merely wrong. Lehrmann then corrected him, referring to the 8-1 decision Eight of them. Abortion pill uptake Meanwhile, new data released by the Guttmacher Institute on Thursday showed that a majority of all abortions are medication abortions, a nonsurgical procedure that induces an abortion through a two-pill cocktail mifepristone and misoprostol. The data showed that 54 percent of abortions in 2020 were medication abortions, up from 39 percent in 2017. The information indicates 2020 was the first year the majority of abortions were medication abortions, and the institute said this percentage has been increasing since the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000. That number is likely to rise after FDA announced in December that it would change two requirements related to how medication abortions can be administered nationwide. The announcement allows mifepristone to be dispensed outside of a clinic and to be stocked in a certified pharmacy. Last year, Texas implemented a second law that reduced the window for providing a medication abortion from 70 days to 49 days less than what FDA recommends.

Copyright 2023 CQ Roll Call. All rights reserved. X","The Texas Supreme Court heard arguments on the state’s controversial abortion law, SB 8, which has effectively blocked nearly all abortions since September 2021 by banning most procedures after six weeks of pregnancy. This law uniquely empowers private citizens to enforce the ban, allowing anyone to sue individuals suspected of aiding an abortion and offering a minimum bounty of $10,000 to successful plaintiffs. This mechanism has kept the law in effect while the legal process continues.

During the hearing, Texas’ attorney, Judd Stone, argued that the court could decide the U.S. Supreme Court’s December ruling—granting a narrow pathway for challenges to the law—was incorrect. Stone emphasized that the law was crafted to prevent lawsuits against state officials enforcing it before it took effect. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in December that challenges could proceed against some state officials, though it barred challenges against state judges and clerks.

Stone also asserted that Texas courts should interpret laws based strictly on their text, a stance differing from what he described as the U.S. Supreme Court’s “fair-weather textualism.” Some Texas justices, including Justice Debra Lehrmann, indicated they would respect the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, while others questioned the interpretation, eliciting light-hearted responses in the courtroom.

In a related development, the Guttmacher Institute released new data showing that the majority of abortions in the U.S. are now medication abortions, which accounted for 54% of all abortions in 2020, up from 39% in 2017. This shift is attributed to the growing use of mifepristone, which the FDA approved in 2000. Texas also passed a law restricting medication abortions to a 49-day window, shorter than the FDA’s 70-day recommendation.

This case and the broader developments highlight ongoing legal and political battles over abortion access in the U.S."

Wade Feb 3, 2021 523 PM EDT Abortion has been at the forefront of conservative politics since the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, in which the court ruled that the Constitution protects a womans liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. Now, with a 6-3 conservative majority in the nations highest court, reproductive rights advocates are worried that right will be chipped away as anti-abortion politicians push legal boundaries to challenge the decision. An Arizona bill proposed on the 48th anniversary of the landmark ruling is among the most direct challenges to Roe in nearly half a century It calls for the decision to be ignored altogether. Arizona has some of the nations most restrictive abortion laws and has three that criminalize it completely two would give women receiving abortions and doctors performing them up to 5 years in prison, and the third makes it a misdemeanor to advertise birth control or abortions. Right now, the legal precedent set by Roe v. Wade prevents the state from enforcing those laws. One proposed bill, HB 2650, would allow those who receive abortions and the doctors who administer them to be prosecuted for homicide, including first-degree murder. In Arizona, first-degree murder is punishable by the death penalty. HB 2650 would also define life as beginning from the moment of conception, revoke state funding for abortion procedures and the clinics that perform them, and stipulate that county attorneys must prosecute homicide by abortion regardless of any contrary or conflicting federal laws, regulations, treaties, court decisions, or executive orders, including in cases of rape and incest. Those actions are blatantly unconstitutional, said Sara Benesh, an associate professor who specializes in the Supreme Court and civil rights and liberties at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. The supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution deems that the Constitution is above any state or local law and that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the Constitution. The court has consistently upheld that the Constitution protects a fundamental right to privacy, including a womans right to choose to end her pregnancy up to the point of viability, meaning the fetus has reached a state in its development where it could survive outside the womb usually defined as around 24 to 28 weeks. In 2018, 99.1 percent of abortions occurred before 21 weeks and 92.2 percent were performed before 13 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Supreme Court has said in numerous opinions that it cannot define where life begins because it is a moral and religious question. States are left to work out the specifics of regulation, including at what stage of a pregnancy a fetus is viable and how abortion clinics operate. Questions about state funding for abortions and when a fetus becomes viable have percolated for years in state-level fights and restrictive abortion laws. In 2019, Ohio, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri all passed heartbeat bills, which ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, the earliest point at which a fetal heartbeat can be detected, though the definition of a heartbeat itself at that stage has also been a matter of debate. All have been met with federal court challenges, blocking enforcement. A near total ban in Alabama in 2019 has been blocked with similar challenges. TEMPE, AZ AUGUST 1 Members of the Apologia Church r encounter protesters defending Planned Parenthood with pink signs on August 1, 2016, in Tempe, Arizona.Ruaridh Connellan Barcroft Ima Barcroft Media via Getty Images Anti-abortion advocates who seek to ban abortion in nearly all cases also seek to challenge the Roe v. Wade decision by definition. More than 500 state laws have been enacted throughout the country since 2010 that further restrict or ban abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, many of which would only be able to take effect if Roe is overturned. READ MORE Whats next for abortion legislation in the U.S.? That activity has continued into 2021. So far in this years legislative session, South Carolinas House approved a heartbeat bill that would charge doctors with a felony for performing an abortion after detecting a heartbeat or without checking for one, Mississippi introduced legislation that would charge anyone who performs an abortion with murder, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and Arizona introduced four other bills that would criminalize abortion providers. Also under consideration in Arizona is a heartbeat bill that would charge medical professionals on the same grounds as in South Carolina, labeling it a class 3 felony punishable with up to eight years and nine months in prison. Arizonas SB 1381 would raise performing an abortion on the basis of sex, gender or disability, from a class 3 felony to a class 2, punishable with up to 10 years in prison. It would also raise the civil penalty for failing to report it from 10,000 to 20,000. SB 1457 would charge doctors who perform abortions on the basis of race, sex or a genetic abnormality with a class 3 felony. And SB 1641 would charge doctors who perform what medical professionals call a dilation and evacuation a surgical procedure that usually takes place in the second trimester with a class 6 felony punishable with up to 2 years in prison. Arizonas HB 2650 is an anomaly in that it holds the mother and the medical professionals liable for murder and leaves the death penalty on the table. It is also the only one of the abortion bills introduced this year with language that specifically asks county attorneys to ignore the federal government. It is an incitement of violence to put out there that people who make this health care choice somehow deserve the death penalty. A 2019 poll from the PBS Newshour, NPR and Marist found that 60 percent of Americans did not want abortion to be criminalized and more than 70 percent of all Americans believe that Roe v. Wade should be upheld, though some supported adding more restrictions. Polls from Pew Research, Gallup and Ipsos found similar levels of support for abortion access. But opinions were deeply divided along party lines 31 percent of Republicans thought the Supreme Court should overturn the landmark ruling, compared to just 4 percent of Democrats, and 65 percent of Republicans said they were somewhat or very dissatisfied with the nations laws around abortion. State Rep. Walt Blackman, a Republican in Snowflake who introduced HB 2650, told the PBS Newshour he does not want to see women go to jail, but he also doesnt want to see babies murdered. Blackman interprets the 14th Amendment as meaning that an unborn fetus has the same rights at conception as its mother. The 14th Amendment, one of the Reconstruction Amendments passed in the years following the end of the Civil War guaranteeing rights to freed slaves, states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens with equal protection under the law, and that states or localities cannot make or enforce laws that violate a citizens constitutional rights. It also says that no state can deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. Blackman said he is concerned about the rate of abortions across the country, particularly in the Black community. CDC data shows abortion rates declined by 24 percent from 2009 to 2018, but nearly 34 percent of all abortions in 2018 were sought out by Black women, despite them making up 13 percent of women in the U.S. Abortion rights advocates argue that taking away this reproductive choice would harm the Black community more than help it. We, as Black women, choose abortion more than any other group in the country, and I think common sense would give you countless reasons for why that is from poverty being overrepresented in our community to just systemic racism to higher infant and maternal mortality rates, said Shyrissa Dobbins, a reproductive justice attorney and author of the peer-reviewed The Myth of Abortion as Black Genocide Reclaiming our Reproductive Choice. Using these statistics to take away reproductive choice dehumanizes and infantilizes Black women, Dobbins said. Criminalizing abortion would only put more Black women in prison, where they are already overrepresented. Blackman suggested expanding foster care and adoption could be a remedy for forcing women to give birth to unwanted children. The idea that you could force a Black woman to give birth and that her child would have this wonderful life in foster care adoption just doesnt line up with the numbers of what were seeing, Dobbins countered. Data shows Black children are already overrepresented in the foster care system and less likely to be adopted. In 2018, Black children made up 23 percent of children in foster care and 22 percent of those waiting to be adopted, despite making up 14 percent of children in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If Blackmans goal is to help the Black community, Dobbins said, he should focus on sentencing reforms and curbing the over-policing of the Black community rather than criminalizing abortion. I feel like 16-year-old me had more rights to bodily autonomy. Blackman holds that this bill does not take away a womans choice, as they can still choose to get an abortion, but must then contend with the harsh consequence being charged with homicide. Abortion rights advocates say the bill will, in effect, make it significantly harder for women to access abortions. If doctors and nurses risk being charged with homicide for performing an abortion, many will choose not to do them and medically safe abortions will become unavailable. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, a nonprofit conservative lobbying group, said the center does not support the part of Blackmans bill that criminalizes women for getting abortions. In the pro-life movement, we love them both, she said. We are not only advocating for the lives of preborn children, but also for the health and safety of their mothers. Herrod said she does not agree with the Roe v. Wade decision or support abortion in any case, including rape or incest, but holds that women should not be punished criminally for seeking an abortion. But SB 1457, which would charge doctors who perform abortions on the basis of race, sex or a genetic abnormality with a class 3 felony, has Herrods support. Luisa Hall Valdez, a Phoenix reproductive rights activist, said abortions should be available to those who choose to get them and should not be criminalized. If people do not support abortions, they dont have to get one, she said. I feel like 16-year-old me had more rights to bodily autonomy, and thats insane to think about, Valdez said. Valdez, who is now 36, said she had two abortions as a teenager, one at 16 and another at 19. She said if she did not terminate her pregnancies, she would not have been able to graduate high school early and enlist in the Army or remain in active duty. She would have become a teen mom during the 2001 economic crisis, and her life would have taken a different trajectory. She said her experiences as a teenager and her experiences escorting pregnant women into abortion centers when anti-abortion protesters were outside of clinics fueled her activism to try gain back the reproductive rights lost since her teenage years. Benesh, of the University of Wisconsin, said its unlikely the Supreme Court will overturn its decision in Roe v. Wade, even with three new conservative justices appointed in the last four years who may be more sympathetic to the anti-abortion argument. She added that the language in HB 2650, which outright disrespects the high court and the Constitutions supremacy clause, makes the justices even more likely to uphold the decision in respect to the statute. The protection for abortion just sort of comes naturally from that basis for questioning the states role in intimate choices. It would be a huge revolution in constitutional law for the court to decide to overturn Roe, she said. READ MORE How Barretts confirmation could influence the fight over abortion access But in the unlikely case that Roe does get overturned, Arizona is one of 24 states with laws already in the books that could immediately ban abortion entirely, according to an analysis by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel wrote in an emailed statement to PBS Newshour that she will not prosecute women for their healthcare choices, adding I do not support this bill. Nearly two-thirds of Arizonas population lives in Maricopa County. State Rep. Athena Salman, D-Tempe, said this bill is representative of the reality that the Republicans who are coming as freshman and sophomores in these past few cycles are very extreme and not reflective of the states values. While HB 2650 is illegal to enforce because of its unconstitutionality, its reverberating effects will last, Salman said, and she fears harassment outside of abortion clinics will increase and more extreme bills will be introduced. It is an incitement of violence to put out there that people who make this health care choice somehow deserve the death penalty, she said. The state legislature must ensure that this bill, and other bad bills, does not become law, Salman said. She is hopeful that one day Democrats will have the majority in the state house so that they can legislate for abortion to be more accessible. Regardless of the outcome, abortion rights advocates say extreme bills like HB 2650 even if they fail increase the stigma around reproductive healthcare. If HB 2650 does pass, legal experts anticipate that advocates will challenge the law in court immediately, as they have with other abortion ban bills, which would prevent it from being enforced until a court decides it can be.

Support for NewsHour Provided By","In 2021, Arizona lawmakers proposed a bill, HB 2650, challenging the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, which protects a woman’s right to choose abortion. The bill aims to criminalize abortion by prosecuting both women seeking abortions and medical professionals performing them for homicide, potentially carrying the death penalty. This proposal, introduced on the 48th anniversary of Roe, also redefines life as beginning at conception and seeks to strip state funding for abortion services.

Arizona already has restrictive abortion laws, including three that criminalize the procedure, with penalties ranging from prison time to fines. Other proposed bills in the state would impose additional penalties on abortion providers, particularly those who perform abortions based on race, sex, or genetic abnormalities, or who conduct second-trimester procedures.

The push to challenge Roe is part of a broader trend, with over 500 restrictive abortion laws introduced in the U.S. since 2010, many aimed at reversing Roe or severely limiting abortion access. Despite these efforts, polls show that a significant majority of Americans, especially Democrats, support abortion rights and want the Roe decision upheld. However, these issues are deeply divided along party lines, with Republicans, especially those in conservative states like Arizona, pushing for stricter regulations.

Opponents of the bill argue that such measures disproportionately impact marginalized communities, particularly Black women, who have higher abortion rates due to factors like poverty and systemic racism. Advocates for abortion rights stress that criminalizing abortion would lead to dangerous consequences, such as medical professionals refusing to perform the procedure and increasing stigma against women seeking reproductive care.

While the bill’s unconstitutionality makes it unlikely to be enforced, its introduction highlights the ongoing political battle over abortion, which continues to shape legislative agendas and public discourse across the U.S."

	•	States with near-total bans: Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia have nearly banned abortion, with exceptions only for the health or life of the mother. Some, like Missouri and Texas, have implemented trigger laws, banning abortion immediately following the Roe reversal.
	•	States with restrictions: Many states have set restrictions, such as bans after certain weeks of pregnancy. For example, Florida and Georgia ban abortion at 15 weeks, while South Carolina has a 22-week limit but also a blocked 6-week ban. States like Idaho and North Dakota enforce strict limits with few exceptions.
	•	States protecting abortion rights: On the other side, many states have bolstered protections for abortion rights. California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, and Vermont, among others, allow abortion at various stages of pregnancy, with some states enacting “shield laws” to protect providers from legal challenges from more restrictive states. Illinois, New York, and Michigan, for example, have made abortion legal up to fetal viability, while Vermont has no gestational limit.
	•	States with legal uncertainties: Some states, like Wisconsin, have seen abortion services halt due to legal challenges around old pre-Roe bans, creating confusion for providers and patients.

In addition to legal shifts, some states, like Nevada and New Hampshire, allow abortion up to 24 weeks, with exceptions for health risks. Others, like Ohio, are in a state of legal flux, with a heartbeat bill being blocked but potentially reactivated.

The landscape is marked by ongoing legal battles and attempts by lawmakers to restrict or expand abortion access, highlighting the diverse approaches each state is taking in the wake of Roe v. Wade’s reversal."

Wade. A medical group says some Texas hospitals have been denying or delaying care to pregnant patients over fears of violating statewide abortion restrictions. Credit Sergio Flores for The Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. The Texas Medical Association is asking state regulators to step in after it says several hospitals afraid of violating the states abortion ban have turned away pregnant patients or delayed care leading to complications, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a letter to the Texas Medical Board the state agency that regulates the practice of medicine TMA officials on Wednesday said they have received complaints that hospital administrators and their legal teams are stopping doctors from providing medically appropriate care to patients with some pregnancy complications. They ask the board to swiftly act to prevent any wrongful intrusion into the practice of medicine. TMA is a professional nonprofit that represents over 55,000 medical professionals in the state. The request comes as confusion and concerns abound among Texas medical professionals over what they can and cannot do under Texas abortion ban. Beyond elective abortions, there are several situations in which a doctor might advise an abortion for the safety of the patient including ectopic pregnancies, in which a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus, making it unviable or provide other stabilizing treatments during hypertension and preeclampsia. Delays in treatment can cause serious health complications. But in a post-Roe world, physicians in states where abortion has been banned have to weigh the legal implications of their actions, instead of making decisions based on what prevailing medical literature recommends. In Texas, doctors can face six-figure fines and be put in jail for any disallowed abortions. According to the Morning News, the TMA included in its letter examples of some cases in which treatment was denied or delayed but did not name specific hospitals. In Central Texas, a physician was allegedly instructed to not treat an ectopic pregnancy until a rupture occurred, which puts patient health at serious risk, the letter says. Delayed or prevented care in this scenario creates a substantial risk for the patients future reproductive ability and poses serious risk to the patients immediate physical wellbeing, the letter says. The TMA letter also accused two other hospitals of telling doctors to turn away pregnant patients and send them home to expel the fetus if their water broke too soon, which can put them at risk of infection. Not only are patients being put at risk of serious injury, but doctors could face lawsuits or the loss of their medical licenses for not providing adequate care, the TMA letter says. Failing to do so might violate the states prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine, which generally prohibits corporations or nonphysicians from practicing medicine. The TMAs plea comes one day after Texas sued the Biden administration to block new federal guidance reiterating to the nations doctors that theyre protected by federal law to terminate a pregnancy as part of emergency treatment. The Biden administration warned that federal dollars could be pulled from institutions that fail to provide care. Texas abortion restrictions a ban that prohibits most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, as well as a law passed last year that will ban nearly all abortions, plus older statutes that outlawed the procedure before Roe have made care for pregnant people more challenging than ever, health care providers say. Without medical assistance during a miscarriage, especially later in the pregnancy, patients face risks such as deadly hemorrhaging and sepsis. Texas abortion laws make exceptions for the procedure if the mothers life is in danger, but even that is fraught with uncertainty, doctors say. Some medical providers say theyre forced to delay or reconsider what treatment options they can prescribe due to the laws, particularly in the cases of those with high-risk pregnancies. Many doctors, legal experts and anti-abortion groups have said the states abortion ban shouldnt apply to miscarriages and life-threatening complications. Texas laws against abortions including the 1925 law the Texas Supreme Court allowed to go back into effect while the U.S. Supreme Court issues the judgment that will formally end Roe v. Wade and the trigger law that will then kick in make exceptions in cases in which an abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother. The trigger law, which will go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Courts judgment, also adds an exception for when a person risks substantial impairment of major bodily function. The states definition of abortion, clarified by state lawmakers in recent years, explicitly says treatments for miscarriages, known as spontaneous abortions in medicine, and ectopic pregnancies do not count as abortions. Texas statutes define abortion as the act of using or prescribing an instrument, a drug, a medicine, or any other substance, device, or means with the intent to cause the death of an unborn child of a woman known to be pregnant. Abortions do not include birth control devices or oral contraceptives, according to the statutes, and treatments to remove a dead, unborn child whose death was caused by spontaneous abortion or to remove an ectopic pregnancy or to save the life or preserve the health of an unborn child. Some doctors in Texas have already faced issues since a law last fall outlawed most abortions past six weeks. And others in the health care industry have kept far away from anything that could be interpreted as running afoul of the states abortion laws. Weve been seeing pharmacists not want to fill certain medications, said Dr. Natalie Crawford, co-founder of Fora Fertility in Austin, which also sees patients during their first trimester. Abortion-inducing medication is the most common method used by Texans to terminate pregnancies, according to Texas Health and Human Services. But it also has a broad range of other uses in obstetrics and gynecology, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, including medical management of miscarriage, induction of labor, cervical dilation before surgical procedures and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. For example, an incomplete miscarriage may require the use of abortion-inducing medications to prevent infection from any remaining tissue. Other times, a patient may not realize they have lost their pregnancy until they go in for a medical exam, and they may not want to wait until their body begins the process of releasing it naturally, one Texas physician told NPR. The medications are also used beyond reproductive care. Misoprostol helps prevent stomach ulcers, but it can induce abortions if taken along with mifepristone. Methotrexate, another abortion-inducing medication, is used to treat ectopic pregnancies as well as rheumatic illnesses, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and cancer. Another Texas law enacted last year forbids dispensing and shipping abortion-inducing medications past seven weeks, but it makes exceptions for when they are used for other medical reasons. Dr. John Thoppil, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said doctors usually note a diagnosis when prescribing medicines, and prescription rejections dont appear to be widespread. If patients run into trouble filling prescriptions, Thoppil and Crawford say they should try to find another pharmacy or talk to their health care provider. We havent seen a large issue, but there are certainly anecdotes, Thoppil said. Thankfully, I think theres still plenty of pharmacies that understand the proper utilization of some of the medications we use for nonelective pregnancy terminations. He said the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been in communication with some pharmacy leaders to help clarify proper interpretation of the rules. And on Wednesday, the Biden administration also warned retail pharmacies that they must fill prescriptions for pills that can induce abortion or risk violating federal civil rights law. Still, Crawford said doctors worry about delays in care, particularly for first trimester conditions such as bleeding, hemorrhaging, septic miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. Those can be acute life-threatening emergencies, she said. Thats why Crawford said its important for patients to quickly seek help if they notice their pregnancy isnt progressing normally. Please go and seek medical care if youre having bleeding in pregnancy. If youre having severe pain, if youre getting a fever, you need to keep your medical team in the loop, she said. We want to keep you safe. The Texas Tribunes Karen Harper contributed to this story.

The association, which represents over 55,000 medical professionals in the state, has expressed concern that hospital administrators and legal teams are preventing doctors from providing necessary treatments, such as for ectopic pregnancies or complications like preeclampsia, for fear of violating the state’s abortion ban.

The Texas abortion law prohibits most abortions after six weeks and carries severe penalties, including fines and jail time for doctors performing illegal abortions. Although the law allows for exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of severe complications, confusion around these exceptions has led to delayed care or patients being turned away. For example, one report alleged that a physician in Central Texas was instructed to wait until an ectopic pregnancy ruptured, risking the patient’s health. Other reports indicated that hospitals told doctors to send home patients with premature ruptured membranes, which could lead to infection.

Doctors have expressed concern over the legal ramifications of providing care, with some fearing lawsuits or the loss of medical licenses for not adhering strictly to the state’s abortion laws. Additionally, some pharmacies have been hesitant to dispense medications that can induce abortions, despite their other uses in treating conditions like miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. The TMA has urged state regulators to clarify guidelines and protect doctors from legal overreach.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has advised that doctors are federally protected to provide emergency care, including abortion in certain circumstances, and warned that federal funds could be withheld from institutions that fail to comply. However, doctors in Texas continue to face challenges in navigating the law while providing necessary medical care, especially for conditions that may require abortion-inducing medications to prevent life-threatening complications. The Texas Medical Association has called for swift intervention from regulators to address these issues and safeguard both patients and healthcare providers."

The Fight for Reproductive Rights July 21, 2022 1258 pm Its been nearly one month since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and Ive had some time to reflect on what this decision means for our country. When I was just 15 years old, Roe v. Wade established that women have a constitutional right to autonomy over our bodies. During my time at Planned Parenthood, I saw firsthand how controlling your own health care allows you to make the best decisions about the course of your life your education, your work and your family. Now, I have watched the extremist Supreme Court take away these rights, stripping away 50 years of precedent, freedom and personal choice. At its core, this decision is about control. Right-wing government officials believe they should decide what women can and cannot do with their bodies women whose lives and stories they will never know. Since Roe was overturned, at least nine states have banned abortion. Republican senators have blocked lifesaving legislation that would protect women who travel for abortion, and the Indiana Attorney General wants to criminally charge the doctor who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old victim of sexual assault. Texas is suing the Biden Administration for requiring that women be provided with lifesaving health care, including abortion, in cases of medical emergency. In other words, they are suing for the power to kill women. The public is overwhelmingly outraged by these actions. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that abortion should be available to women, and more Americans describe themselves as pro-choice today than at any other point in the last 25 years. We have to keep fighting. In an op-ed for The New York Times that I wrote with Senator Elizabeth Warren D Mass., we talk about what elected officials and everyday Americans can do to help others access reproductive care. You can read our piece here. In Congress, I support putting the protections of Roe v. Wade into law, upholding the right of women to travel across state lines to receive an abortion, and I have introduced legislation to protect access to medication abortion in places where it is still legal. Im encouraged by the Biden Administrations steps to defend abortion access. But let me be clear the only way to restore reproductive rights across the nation is through Congress. I will continue to push tirelessly to defend womens right to make decisions about their own lives and bodies, and I will not stop organizing and fighting until womens freedoms can be exercised equally in all parts of this country. Privacy Policy Accessibility English","Senator Tina Smith’s statement, titled The Fight for Reproductive Rights, reflects her reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which revoked the constitutional right to abortion. She discusses the significance of Roe, recalling her experience at Planned Parenthood where she witnessed how access to reproductive healthcare empowers women to make life decisions related to education, work, and family. The Senator condemns the decision as an attempt to control women’s bodies, driven by right-wing politicians who aim to impose restrictions on women’s autonomy.

Smith emphasizes the consequences of the ruling, including the banning of abortion in at least nine states, the blocking of protective legislation by Republican senators, and threats to prosecute doctors who provide abortion services, particularly in extreme cases like a 10-year-old victim of sexual assault. She also criticizes Texas’s lawsuit against the Biden Administration’s efforts to ensure that women receive necessary healthcare, including abortion in emergencies.

Smith highlights public outrage, noting that nearly two-thirds of Americans support abortion rights and that pro-choice sentiment is at its highest in 25 years. She stresses the need for continued activism and legislation to protect reproductive rights. In her work, she supports efforts to codify Roe v. Wade into law, defend women’s right to travel for abortion, and protect access to medication abortion in legal jurisdictions. She acknowledges the Biden Administration’s efforts but clarifies that the restoration of reproductive rights must come through Congressional action. Smith vows to keep fighting for women’s rights, ensuring equal freedoms across the nation."

AP North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein wont defend state restrictions on dispensing abortion pills that are being challenged in a lawsuit and instead will argue the restrictions are preempted by federal regulations protecting access to the pills, Steins office said Monday.The decision by Stein, a Democrat, means Republican legislative leaders who want to keep the restrictions would have to seek to formally intervene in the federal lawsuit, which was filed by Amy Bryant, a physician who prescribes the drug mifepristone.The lawsuit filed in January in U.S. District Court in Durham, and a separate lawsuit challenging limits on abortion pills in West Virginia, are considered the openings of legal battles over access to the medications. A Texas lawsuit poses a threat to the nationwide availability of medication abortion, which now accounts for the majority of abortions in the U.S. The case filed by abortion opponents seeks to reverse FDA approval of mifepristone. Bryants lawsuit seeks to block enforcement of state laws and rules that it says interferes with the ability to provide mifepristone to patients. The lawsuit cites the authority that Congress gave to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate the FDA-approved drug.

Stein, who supports abortion rights and is running for governor next year, is a defendant in the lawsuit along with a district attorney and state health and medical officials. Stein and state Department of Justice attorneys are tasked with defending state laws in court. In this case, Bryants federal preemption arguments are legally correct, Sarah Boyce, general counsel at the state Department of Justice, wrote in a letter to legislative lawyers for House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger. Consistent with its statutory authority, the FDA has determined that restrictions like the ones imposed under North Carolina state law would unduly burden patients access to a safe and effective drug, Boyce wrote. The departments filings in the lawsuit on behalf of Attorney General Stein will reflect this legal analysis on the merits.Spokespeople for Berger and Moore didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.The U.S. Supreme Court decision last June that overturned Roe v. Wade turning decision-making over abortion to the states has brought renewed focus on medication abortions. Nineteen states including North Carolina and West Virginia have laws controlling how, when and where physicians can prescribe and dispense abortion drugs. In a written statement related to Mondays letter, Stein said North Carolinas restriction of womens use of the prescriptions they need to exercise their reproductive freedoms violates federal law and the Constitution.The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 to end pregnancy, when used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol. The combination is approved for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy. The FDA eliminated an in-person requirement for the pill, which can be shipped by mail-order or picked up at brick-and-mortar pharmacies.","North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has announced that he will not defend state restrictions on abortion pills in an ongoing federal lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed by physician Amy Bryant in January 2023, challenges state laws that impose restrictions on the dispensing of the abortion drug mifepristone. These state laws require in-person dispensing after a 72-hour waiting period, mandatory counseling, and sometimes an ultrasound.

Stein, a Democrat and advocate for abortion rights, argues that these state restrictions are preempted by federal regulations that protect access to mifepristone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the drug, and Stein’s legal team asserts that the state laws interfere with this authority. The lawsuit asserts that these restrictions violate federal law and the U.S. Constitution, and that the FDA’s approval of mifepristone should supersede state-level limitations.

This move by Stein means that Republican lawmakers, who support the restrictions, would need to intervene in the case to defend the laws. The legal battle is part of a broader national debate about access to abortion medication following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to various state-level restrictions on medication abortion.

The federal case against North Carolina is part of larger legal challenges involving abortion pills, including lawsuits in Texas and West Virginia, which could significantly affect the availability of medication abortions in the U.S."

Santos Manila05152020May 15, 2020Amid a lockdown, staffing shortages and overcrowded hospitals, women are losing access to family planning services and essential lifesaving care. Ana P. Santos reports from Manila. Getty ImagesE. AcayanAdvertisementAs already scarce medical resources are being redirected to respond to COVID-19, women in need of maternal and reproductive health services are paying the price. According to government data, family planning services were reduced by over 50 in March, when a lockdown was declared to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""The suspension of public transportation, limited clinic staff and reduced clinic hours have made it difficult for women to access family planning services,"" said Juan Antonio Perez, executive director of the Commission on Population and Development. According to Perez, a number of government-run reproductive health clinics are operating with only two-thirds of their regular staff, as many health care workers have been unable to get to the clinics due to lockdown measures. Subscribe to Corona Compact DW's newsletter tracking coronavirus in Asia To fill in the gap, government health workers have started going door-to-door to deliver birth control that will last for up to three months. Additionally, telephone hotlines have been set up for remote medical consultations, in place of face-to-face doctor visits. ""It's too early to tell what the full impact of this pandemic on reproductive health will be, but we are trying to stay ahead of the curve,"" Perez told DW. As of May 15, the Southeast Asian island nation, which has the third highest number of cases in the region, had recorded 11,876 COVID-19 cases and 790 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Read more Coronavirus Vulnerable Filipinos fight for survival during lockdown Millions cut off from services The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA estimates that 47 million women in low and middle income countries like the Philippines may not be able to access modern contraceptives, as overwhelmed health care systems close facilities or limit family planning services due to staff shortages. If lockdown measures continue for another six months, such a health care shortage could cause 7 million unintended pregnancies, according to UNFPA estimates. Earlier this week, authorities extended lockdown measures in the capital of Manila and neighboring cities until the end of May, while allowing certain industries to resume operations in order to jumpstart the economy. But some women, like 26-year-old Dimples Ortiz, are suffering. Ortiz has been struggling to feed her two children one 18-month-old and one 6-month-old since her husband lost his construction job in March due to suspended operations. She wasn't able to get another dose of her contraceptive injection, and fears an untimely pregnancy that would add to her financial worries. ""My eldest child has a disability. We dont know when my husband can find work again. I cannot get pregnant,"" Ortiz told DW. In her desperation, she reached out to the Likhaan Center for Womens Health an organization that runs community clinics. Likhaan then arranged to pick Ortiz up from her home, and take her to get a free contraceptive implant. ""In some areas under lockdown, you can only go out on certain days and only at specific times,"" said Diane Vere, who works for the Likhaan Center. ""Women now have to choose how to spend their limited time. Do they go to the market, go to get their social assistance from the government or go to the clinic for their family planning needs? Each activity could entail hours of waiting in long lines. How do you choose?"" she said. Read more Coronavirus Demand for Filipino nurses increases in Europe An overwhelmed system Meanwhile, reproductive health advocates are demanding urgent action to address the increasing number of pregnant women who are being rejected by hospitals. Last month, a 26-year-old woman died after six hospitals refused to admit her because they were either full or understaffed. The woman, Katherine Bulatao, had given birth at home but died of blood loss afterwards. Another woman, Mary Jane Alpide, died in labor after being turned away from four hospitals, and finally being admitted to the fifth, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. The center says it has received at least three reports of pregnant women being refused treatment by hospitals. ""Obstetric emergencies cannot be scheduled. The current pandemic and resource constraints do not justify the refusal of lifesaving medical attention,"" Jihan Jacob, the Asia Legal Adviser of the Center for Reproductive Rights told DW. The shortcomings in the Philippines' health care system have long been apparent, but Jacob fears that conditions are becoming even worse due to the pandemic. ""Deaths of women like Bulatao and Alpide are preventable. The fact that it happened is a failure of our health care system,"" she said.

As the health system is overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, essential maternal and reproductive health services have been severely impacted.

Key points include:
	1.	Reduced Family Planning Services: Government data indicates that family planning services were cut by over 50% in March due to the lockdown. The suspension of public transport, staff shortages, and limited clinic hours made it difficult for women to access these services. Some clinics are operating with only two-thirds of their regular staff, and many health workers are unable to reach clinics due to the lockdown.
	2.	Adaptation to Limitations: To address this, health workers have started delivering birth control pills and injections directly to women’s homes, and hotlines have been set up for remote medical consultations. However, the full impact of these changes on reproductive health remains uncertain.
	3.	UNFPA Concerns: The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has warned that millions of women in low-income countries, including the Philippines, might face a lack of access to contraceptives, leading to unintended pregnancies. In extreme cases, a six-month lockdown could result in an estimated 7 million unintended pregnancies.
	4.	Personal Impact: The article shares the story of Dimples Ortiz, a mother of two who struggles financially after her husband lost his job. She was unable to receive her contraceptive injection due to the lockdown, adding to her anxiety over a potential unwanted pregnancy. Non-governmental organizations like the Likhaan Center for Women’s Health are stepping in to provide support, but women are forced to prioritize which essential services they can access, given the limited time and resources available.
	5.	Health System Failures: The article also reports tragic instances of women being denied critical obstetric care during the pandemic. Hospitals, overwhelmed and understaffed, turned away women in labor, leading to deaths. Two such cases, Katherine Bulatao and Mary Jane Alpide, illustrate the deadly consequences of a strained health system. The Center for Reproductive Rights has called these deaths preventable and emphasized the failure of the health care system.

In summary, the pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing challenges in the Philippines’ health system, especially for women in need of reproductive health services. The shortage of resources and the strain on the system have led to significant risks for women’s health, including preventable deaths and unintended pregnancies."

Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Madras High Court. File Observing that the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the Constitution includes the right to decent burial or cremation, the Madras High Court on Monday warned local residents against raising objections to the disposal of the bodies of those who had died due to COVID-19. Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and M. Nirmal Kumar took up a suo motu public interest litigation petition, with the permission of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, after a neurosurgeons body was not allowed to be buried in a cemetery at Kilpauk here on Sunday. The judges said, according to news reports, local residents had opposed burial of the surgeons body at the Kilpauk cemetery. Consequently, the body was taken to a burial ground at Velangadu in New Avadi Road where again a mob attempted to prevent the burial.In the process, some public servants had sustained injuries when they attempted to disperse the mob. The ambulance, in which the body was transported, was also damaged. Such acts were completely unacceptable and legally punishable, the judges pointed out.It prima facie appears that as a consequence of the above said alleged acts, a person who practised a noble profession as a doctor, and breathed his last, has been deprived of his right to have a burial in a cemetery earmarked for that purpose, the Division Bench lamented.The Bench pointed out that the Code of Criminal Procedure contains enough provisions to deal with maintenance of public order, discouraging unlawful assemblies, dispersal of such assemblies using civil force and immunity to police personnel involved in such action.Authoring the interim order, Justice Sathyanarayanan also pointed out that Section 297 of the Indian Penal Code states it is a punishable offence to trespass into a burial ground or crematorium and cause indignity to the corpse or disturbance to performance of funeral rites.Centres guidelinesPeople found guilty under the Section could be punished with imprisonment that could extend up to one year or with fine or both. The court also recalled that the Centre had already issued an advisory to the citizens and urged them to avoid social stigma associated with COVID-19. Further, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had also issued guidelines on March 16 with respect to management of bodies of those who die due to COVID-19. Those guidelines require strict adherence to infection prevention control practices.Those guidelines require the body to be secured in a body bag, the exterior of which should be decontaminated. Environmental cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is to be done with one per cent Sodium Hypochlorite solution. Autopsy should be avoided and embalming should not be allowed.At the crematoriumburial ground, the staff should be sensitised that COVID-19 does not pose additional risk, the Ministrys guidelines read. Stating that these guidelines were available in the public domain, the judges said, people were expected to be aware of them.The court also ordered notice to the State government and adjourned further hearing on the PIL petition to April 28.

This statement was made in response to incidents in which local residents opposed the burial of a neurosurgeon’s body, who died from COVID-19, at a cemetery in Kilpauk, Chennai. Despite the body being moved to another burial ground in Velangadu, a mob attempted to block the burial, resulting in injuries to public servants and damage to an ambulance. The court condemned these actions as unlawful and punishable under Section 297 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalizes trespassing into burial grounds and disturbing funeral rites.

The court also referenced guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for handling the bodies of COVID-19 victims, which include specific infection control measures. These guidelines are available to the public, and people are expected to follow them. The court issued a notice to the state government and adjourned the case for further hearing.

Abortion rights activists react after the Indiana Senate votes to enact a near total abortion ban in August 2022. Jeremy HoganSOPA ImagesLightRocketGetty Images The end of Roe could be changing peoples minds about abortion bans Backlash to a 15-week ban and shifting public opinion data suggests people may be less tolerant of laws prohibiting second-trimester abortions. Health Reporter Published 2022-09-19 0637 637 September 19, 2022 am Share Twitter Facebook Roe v. Wades overturn may have meaningfully shifted public opinion on abortion for the first time in years, a change that could affect what kinds of bans or restrictions abortion rights opponents can safely consider. Polling on abortion, while complicated to pull off, had long been relatively static. For decades, most Americans have identified as pro-choice, believing that abortion should be legal under certain circumstances, according to Gallup. Since the 1990s, around 60 percent of Americans have also supported the right to an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. And for just as long, polling has also found that support for abortions in the second trimester has consistently been lower than for those in the first, Gallup has found falling from that 60 percent approval to somewhere between 25 and 30 percent of Americans. Public opinion on second-trimester abortions has informed how some Republicans including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have framed abortion access in the post-Roe world, pushing for laws that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. But sharp backlash to those proposals alongside shifting public opinion data suggests that when 15-week abortion bans go from theoretical to looming reality, Americans may be less likely to favor banning abortion in the second trimester. Republicans quickly distanced themselves this week from Grahams bill for a 15-week national abortion ban, which only has three cosponsors. A comparable bill in the House of Representatives has 86 cosponsors, which is sizable but still less than half of the Republican caucus. That hesitation may reflect a nascent shift, some public opinion experts said. Sign up for more news and context delivered to your inbox, daily Submitting As voters are thinking about this, and as I think more meaningfully states pass these bans and theyre seeing women denied abortion care in cases they feel are appropriate and necessary, I think they are moving, said Molly Murphy, a pollster and president at the Democratically-aligned firm Impact Research. I do think there has been a shift, and that voters are more aware of what these bans do and what they mean. A poll conducted in part by Impact Research in March months before Roe v. Wade was overturned in the case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization found that most Americans favored laws banning abortions after 15 weeks. A poll done in August, after the Dobbs decision was released, found the opposite. The results cant be perfectly compared. In March, respondents were asked about a 15-week ban that had exceptions for cases of pregnancy resulting from rape and incest. In August, the hypothetical 15-week ban lacked such exceptions. But they fit within a larger pattern, Murphy said. In March, 11 percent of people in that poll were likely to say abortion should be outlawed in all cases, and 55 percent said it should be legal in all or most cases. In August, the percentage of people who favored total bans fell to 6 percent the percentage supporting abortion in all or most cases rose to 60 percent. A 19th NewsSurveyMonkey poll done in August also found 60 percent of American adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The average voter doesnt spend much time thinking about abortion and they dont spend much time rethinking their beliefs unless they have to, Murphy said. What the Dobbs decision has done has forced people to reexamine their beliefs, and as they have, theyve moved toward more abortion access. Meanwhile, polling from the Public Research Religion Institute also conducted after the Dobbs decision found that 52 percent of Americans opposed laws banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Most Democrats and most independents opposed such bans, PRRI found. PRRI doesnt have historical data on 15-week bans, specifically. But that organization has also seen a meaningful increase in the number of Americans saying abortions should be legal in all cases. In 2010, only 18 percent of Americans favored that policy, per data shared with The 19th. In the most recent post-Dobbs polling, 33 percent said so. In that same time period, the percentage of Americans who said abortions should be banned entirely fell from 15 to 8. The change likely reflects the fact that overturning Roe made more Americans revisit their views on abortion, said Melissa Deckman, PRRIs CEO. It was one thing to say, Its reasonable to have restrictions when Roe was law of the land. It was more abstract, she said. Now its a situation where people are asking what should those restrictions, if any, look like. Its rejiggered the conversation. Still, if Republicans take back both chambers of Congress in the November midterm elections which seems less likely, with Democrats odds of holding the Senate improving and win the White House in 2024, its not clear if the shifting public consensus would deter them from pursuing an abortion ban, Deckman said. On a state level, the impact of shifting public opinion is perhaps even less, suggested Michael Binder, a pollster at the University of North Florida. Polling conducted by the university found that most Floridians opposed a 15-week abortion ban but because many Republicans, who control the state legislature, still favor restrictions, public opinion did not stop the state from passing and enforcing such a law. In the coming years, he said, Republican support for abortion restrictions will likely matter more at least in shaping policy in the states where the GOP retains power. Statewide or national public opinion isnt particularly meaningful. What matters is the partisan support or opposition within the party in power, he said.

Events Jobs About Us Community Guidelines Membership Membership FAQ Ways to Give Sponsorship Privacy Instagram","The overturning of Roe v. Wade appears to have shifted public opinion on abortion bans, especially regarding second-trimester restrictions. Prior to the decision, American polling consistently showed majority support for abortion in the first trimester, but significantly less for second-trimester abortions. However, recent polling data after the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling suggests that public sentiment is evolving.

For instance, a poll from March 2022 indicated majority support for laws banning abortion after 15 weeks, but by August, this support reversed, with a significant portion of respondents opposing such bans. The change was partly attributed to the absence of exceptions for rape or incest in post-Dobbs discussions. This shift suggests that many Americans, when faced with the reality of restrictive laws, are reconsidering their stance on abortion access. Polls now show around 60% of Americans supporting abortion in all or most cases, with opposition to total abortion bans rising.

Experts suggest that Roe v. Wade’s end has prompted more people to think critically about abortion policies, leading to increased support for access. However, despite the shifting public consensus, political dynamics remain complex. Republicans, who have historically pushed for abortion restrictions, may still pursue these laws, especially at the state level where GOP-controlled legislatures continue to enact bans despite public opposition. The influence of public opinion may be less significant in states where Republicans hold power, with partisan support playing a more decisive role in shaping policy.

Overall, while abortion restrictions remain politically contentious, the post-Roe landscape has caused a meaningful shift in public opinion, which could have long-term implications for future abortion laws."

While the first jump to 90Hz was a notable difference, the jump to 120Hz is a whole different game. The Galaxy S20 Ultra also has a 120Hz display, but the 120Hz setting works with the 8 Pro's full resolution the S20 Ultra is limited to FHD. The 8 Pro has a QHD resolution spanning 3168x1440 pixels. OnePlus also claims a maximum brightness of 1,300 nits, which we certainly won't reach in our standardized brightness test, but we'll tweak it a bit to see if we can achieve the advertised number. In our standardized brightness test - the one that we use to compare displays across devices - the OnePlus 8 Pro maxed out at 538 nits with the manual brightness slider, but when we tested its Automatic brightness in bright daylight, it reached 888 nits. Not quite the 1,300 it advertised, but there's a reason why - the max brightness AMOLEDs are able to pump out depends on the size of the test pattern on the screen. Our white test pattern with which we measure max brightness takes up 75 of the screen during measurement and this is consistent across all measurements we do. Manufacturers, however, are free to choose their preferred testing methodology. In the case of OnePlus, we were able to reach up to 1,180 nits, however, this was with a much smaller test pattern.

The screen is also compatible with HDR10 and can add some saturation and colors to your viewing experience when watching supported apps. In our tests, the OnePlus 8 Pro's default Vivid setting has slightly cooler whites and based on the DCI-P3 color space. This profile yielded an average deltaE of 3.1 and a maximum deltaE of 5.9. We found the Natural profile to be very color accurate average deltaE of 2.5 and max deltaE of 4.1 in the sRGB space. Meanwhile, the Advanced DCI-P3 profile had an average deltaE of 2.5 and max of 4.3. There are two features of the 8 Pro's display ""Vibrant Color effect Pro"" and ""Motion graphics smoothing"". The latter is the first time a phone maker has ever implemented motion smoothing into a smartphone display. This feature will essentially make any 24fps or above video playback as if it were of a higher framerate by interpolating additional frames in between the original ones. The use of motion smoothing is controversial in the film industry since directors and actors argue that watching TV shows or films with this feature alters the intended viewing experience originally envisioned by their creators. Motion smoothing has become a way for TV makers to sell higher refresh-rate TVs, even if the content being viewed on it isn't meant for it. The actual MEMC feature works as advertised for the most part - it makes content in supported video apps appear smoother than their original frame rates. In practice, however, this isn't consistent. It really depends on whether you're watching cartoons, vlogs, or live-action TV shows with actors in the frame. We personally found it a little distracting when the motion smoothing drifted in and out between scenes. Battery life Update July 3 2020 We've updated the battery section with new web browsing, video playback runtimes and overall endurance rating in both the 120Hz and the 60Hz display modes. The OnePlus 8 Pro packs a 4,510 mAh battery inside. Considering the phone's larger display, we were hoping for a more significant battery upgrade. We were not, however, disappointed with the battery results. For our battery tests of the 8 Pro, we have two resulting battery endurance scores. One for the phone's default 120Hz display setting - which, naturally, consumes more battery - and another for the conventional 60Hz setting. So, how did the OnePlus 8 Pro do? Not bad. With the 120Hz mode, which remains at full resolution, the OnePlus 8 Pro yielded an endurance score of 103h. It managed a call time of 2835h, and 1058h of web browsing, which is a respectable time. Meanwhile, video playback was excellent at 1803h. Of course, since the OS switches back to 60Hz when it detects full-screen video playback, we didn't find any difference in the video playback test. Switching to the display's standard 60Hz setting gave us a tad higher numbers in web browsing times. There was a 109h endurance score in this mode, which confirms that you can pull some extra hours from the battery, but at the expense of the phone's most note-worthy feature - the 120Hz display. This did manage to squeeze almost two hours of web browsing 1245h and video playback. Our battery tests were automated thanks to SmartViser, using its viSer App. The endurance rating above denotes how long a single battery charge will last you if you use the OnePlus 8 Pro for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily. We've established this usage pattern so that our battery results are comparable across devices in the most common day-to-day tasks. The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritty. You can check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use. This does bring us to the point of fast charging. Although this isn't quite the 5,000 mAh battery that we're seeing in flagships from Samsung and LG, the OnePlus 8 Pro's Warp Charge 30T makes up for that. The Warp Charge 30T was able to recharge the OnePlus 8 Pro from 0 to 63 in half an hour. New to the battery menu is an ""Optimized charging"" option that can learn your usage patterns and temporarily slow or suspend charging while the 8 Pro is plugged in. If you go to bed at, say 11 PM and plug it in, the phone will suspend charging throughout the night and will finish its charge by the time you normally wake up in the morning. Optimized charging setting Since COVID-19 has messed up everyone's normal sleep schedules, we weren't able to test this thoroughly. OnePlus introduced wireless charging on any of its smartphones and the Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger is a beast. OnePlus promises a 30-minute charge on the Warp Charge 30 Wireless will yield a 50 charge. We managed just under the promised number at 48. The second time around, however, the 8 Pro recharged to 51 in the same amount of time. The charger unit has a fan in it that actively pushed air in from the back of the charger and forces it up along the backside of the phone to keep it cool while Warp charging. The fan tends to be distracting if you're in a quiet room, so OnePlus built-in an option into the UI called ""Bed time mode"". This silences the fan during bedtime hours you specify at the expense of slower wireless charging. Bedtime mode OnePlus was against adding the feature to its devices until it deemed the feature would be worth the added cost. Well. the cost is certainly present because the Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger is sold separately for 69. Is it worth this price? It really depends on whether you think wireless charging should be about speed over convenience. One complaint about the charger is that the charging cable is permanently tethered on both ends. This means you won't be able to replace a cable if it gets damaged, and you may not be able to feed it through a wiring management setup you may have at a desk or table. Speakers The OnePlus 8 Pro showed similar results to the OnePlus 8 on our loudspeaker test but with some small improvements. Maybe the vanilla 8 sounds a bit flat when put against the Pro. The former, on the other hand, is just a tad louder. Only a few phones can match the 8 Pro in terms of loudness and sound quality at the same time. The bass is deep - as far as smartphone speakers go, of course - without sounding muddy while vocals are clear and the mids contribute to the overall fullness. Perhaps the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G is one of those phones that sound noticeably better than the OnePlus 8 family. You can hear for yourself and compare the charts. Use the Playback controls to listen to the phone sample recordings best use headphones. We measure the average loudness of the speakers in LUFS. A lower absolute value means a louder sound. A look at the frequency response chart will tell you how far off the ideal ""0db"" flat line is the reproduction of the bass, treble, and mid frequencies. You can add more phones to compare how they differ. The scores and ratings are not comparable with our older loudspeaker test. Learn more about how we test here. Audio output quality We've recently discontinued our audio output quality test. The reason for that is that most phones were already excellent in this regard and whatever difference there was, it was marginal and probably indistinguishable to anything but lab equipment.

Display:

The OnePlus 8 Pro introduces a 120Hz display, doubling the refresh rate from the previous 90Hz screens. Unlike the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the OnePlus 8 Pro offers 120Hz with its full QHD+ resolution of 3168x1440 pixels. It also boasts impressive brightness, reaching up to 888 nits in automatic brightness tests, and a maximum of 1,180 nits with a smaller test pattern. Although the 1,300 nits claimed by OnePlus was not reached, the display is still highly impressive. The phone also supports HDR10 and offers vibrant, color-accurate displays with different settings such as “Vivid” and “Natural,” offering various color profiles for different preferences. A new feature, “Motion Graphics Smoothing,” interpolates frames to make video content smoother, though its performance is inconsistent, especially for live-action content.

Battery Life:

The OnePlus 8 Pro comes with a 4,510 mAh battery, and its performance varies based on the display’s refresh rate. In the 120Hz mode, it scored an endurance of 103 hours, with impressive results for call time, web browsing, and video playback. Switching to the 60Hz mode slightly improved battery life, with an endurance score of 109 hours. The device also supports Warp Charge 30T, recharging the phone to 63% in 30 minutes. The review also highlights the “Optimized Charging” feature, which adjusts charging speeds based on the user’s sleep schedule. OnePlus introduced wireless charging with its Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger, capable of charging the device to 50% in 30 minutes, though it can be noisy due to an internal fan that cools the phone during charging. The charger is sold separately for $69.

Speakers:

The OnePlus 8 Pro’s loudspeaker performance is better than the OnePlus 8, offering louder and clearer sound with deep bass and clear vocals. While some competitors, like the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G, provide slightly better sound quality, the OnePlus 8 Pro remains one of the best in terms of loudness and clarity.

Conclusion:

The OnePlus 8 Pro offers a great combination of a high-quality display, solid battery life, fast charging, and strong speaker performance. However, the addition of motion smoothing on the display might be controversial for users who prefer unaltered video playback. The device’s pricing, especially for accessories like the Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger, will depend on individual preferences regarding the trade-off between speed and convenience."

Merv Riepe proposes less stringent, 12-week abortion ban Sen. Joni Albrecht says without Riepes support, she may not have enough votes for ban after cardiac activity By Aaron Sanderford - March 15, 2023 518 pm State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston talks with legislative staff on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature on Wednesday, March 15, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. Zach WendlingNebraska Examiner LINCOLN The path to passage for a proposed ban on Nebraska abortions after an ultrasound detects cardiac activity ran into a Ralston-sized roadblock on Wednesday. Ralston State Sen. Merve Riepe, a former hospital administrator who supported previous efforts to restrict abortion, proposed amending the restriction in Legislative Bill 626 to instead make abortions illegal after 12 weeks. Nebraska State Sen. Merv Riepe, District 12. Photo by Craig Chandler. He said he and other senators who oppose abortion but prefer a measured approach want to discuss an alternative to the heartbeat bill, which sponsors have said would essentially ban abortions after about six weeks of gestation. I wish we wouldve had the debate before things got introduced, but we didnt, he said. Sometimes youve got to do what it takes when something deserves a discussion. Riepe said he filed the amendment and walked over to explain his reasons for filing it to State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who sponsored LB 626. Riepe was a co-sponsor of the more restrictive bill. Riepe said the six-week ban is tantamount to a total ban, which many of his constituents oppose, he said. His comments echoed the views of most of the doctors who testified against LB 626 in a public hearing. Riepe said that he doesnt like surprises and that he didnt like surprising anyone with his amendment. But, he said, he was surprised when LB 626 was introduced instead of a 12-week ban. Albrecht disappointed Albrecht told him Wednesday she was disappointed by his amendment. She told reporters that losing Riepes vote for cloture might put the bill at risk of falling to a filibuster from abortion rights advocates. The bill needs 33 votes to overcome a filibuster. Albrecht said she has just enough support to get the bill over the line, but a single supporters departure could stall it. She said Riepes 12-week ban is not acceptable to myself or the other 32 supporters. She argued that her bill is not about a ban. Its sad, she said, adding that his amendment has created confusion about whether he will ultimately vote for the bill or not. Riepe said he has no problem being the 33rd vote to get LB 626 past the first round of debate. But he wants a full and fair debate on his amendment in the second round of debate, he said. State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston speaks during debate in the Nebraska Legislature. Unicameral Information OfficeUnicameral Update Riepe said he knows this is going to turn people against him, but he said the discussion is worth having, even if it means he has to get a dog so I can have a friend. Senators had discussed 12 weeks Anti-abortion groups including Nebraska Right to Life and the Nebraska Family Alliance have argued that Nebraska should ban abortion outright. The state currently bans abortions after 20 weeks. In the last legislative session, senators fell two votes short of passing a bill put forward by Albrecht and then-Sen. Mike Flood to ban abortion in Nebraska if Roe v. Wade was overturned. After the U.S. Supreme Court took that step in June and sent the decision back to the states, Riepe said he gladly signed onto a letter last summer by then-Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers to support a 12-week ban in a special session, but supporters couldnt find the 33 senators needed. He said he was surprised to see the new legislation come back using cardiac activity as the standard, because that usually occurs around six weeks of gestational age. Riepe said he has heard from doctors and constituents that most women wont know they are pregnant in time to make an ultrasound appointment, let alone decide. He worries that women who want to terminate their pregnancies might try to induce their own abortions or harm themselves. He said he also worries that LB 626 will encourage women who miss the cardiac deadline to accuse a partner of sexual assault, which could lead to criminal investigations and charges. All sides watching Andi Curry Grubb of Planned Parenthood of Nebraska said her group is not celebrating Riepes amendment, because it still restricts a womans ability to exercise autonomy over her body. Grubb said state senators who oppose abortion are figuring out that Nebraskans dont want them to pass a bill as extreme as LB 626. And women and their allies need to keep working. Hundreds pack a hearing room to testify for and against Legislative Bill 626, the bill that would ban abortions in Nebraska after an ultrasound detects embryonic cardiac activity. Aaron SanderfordNebraska Examiner Its interesting that there is someone who is this conservative and has been so conservative that he would be the one raising these questions, Grubb said. The outlook on this bill has changed literally every day for the last three weeks, she said. We cannot relax until the bill is defeated. Anti-abortion activists huddled Wednesday to figure out a way forward. Nate Grasz of the Nebraska Family Alliance and Sandy Danek of Nebraska Right to Life said their organizations oppose Riepes amendment. This amendment will cost 1,700 lives, Grasz said. Danek said LB 626 would stop more than 2,000 abortions a year, based on 2021 statistics compiled by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. About 300 abortions a year in Nebraska are performed after 12 weeks. Nebraska Examiner senior reporter Paul Hammel contributed to this report.

The original bill, introduced by Senator Joni Albrecht, proposes a near-total abortion ban after about six weeks of pregnancy, which opponents argue is too restrictive. Riepe, a former hospital administrator, suggests a 12-week ban as a more moderate alternative, one that would still restrict abortion but offer women more time to make decisions.

Riepe’s amendment has stirred controversy within the Nebraska Legislature. He argues that a six-week ban, which is effectively a total abortion ban, would not be well-received by many of his constituents and could lead to unintended consequences, such as women attempting self-induced abortions or falsely accusing partners of sexual assault to avoid criminal investigations. Riepe was surprised that the bill focused on a six-week ban instead of a 12-week limit, which had been discussed in previous sessions.

Senator Albrecht, the bill’s sponsor, expressed disappointment with Riepe’s amendment, stating it could jeopardize the bill’s chances of passing due to potential opposition from abortion-rights advocates. She emphasized that the bill was not meant to be an outright ban, and losing Riepe’s support could lead to a filibuster. Albrecht believes that the 12-week ban is unacceptable and would fail to secure the 33 votes necessary to pass the bill.

Anti-abortion groups such as Nebraska Right to Life and Nebraska Family Alliance oppose Riepe’s proposal, arguing that a 12-week ban would result in fewer lives being saved compared to the stricter six-week ban. They point out that about 300 abortions in Nebraska occur after 12 weeks annually, and they believe the original bill would prevent thousands of abortions each year.

While Riepe’s amendment has sparked debate, it also reflects the division within the legislature and among anti-abortion groups about the extent of restrictions on abortion. Planned Parenthood has criticized the amendment, stating it still limits women’s autonomy, while some lawmakers continue to push for even more stringent measures. The situation remains fluid, and the bill’s outcome is uncertain."

It really started out as a heart to share and grow the pro-life message and to have an impact in the fight for life, Krecic said. I saw a need, and I thought this could be a really cool thing if we were able to share the pro-life message and also have an impact in supporting pregnancy care centers. Krecic runs the business with the help of his wife and a friend. Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News! Purpose-driven business Ten percent of each bag sold, roughly 1.69, goes to pro-life pregnancy centers. Ten centers received financial assistance from Seven Weeks Coffee since the business began in November 2021, Krecic said, including one in Virginia that opened a second location. Another center received help to obtain an ultrasound for its mobile unit. Our purpose is to really try to find those centers with needs and meet them, he said. Based in Virginia near the Washington, D.C. area, Seven Weeks Coffee made an appearance in January at the National March for Life and the Pro-Life Summit, sharing not only hot coffee with attendees on those cold days, but also affirming pro-life organizations and events. I've been able to share this coffee and mission, Krecic said. It is a social cause and a values-based business. We're using something that people love to drink anyway, and we're providing a superior product and get to work with one of the best roasters in the nation that has some of the best coffees to offer, so not only do our customers get a really great product, but they're also having very huge impact for life. Tweet This A heart to share and grow the pro-life message has become and initiative to support pregnancy help centers through coffee sales. In addition to attending events, Seven Weeks Coffee is an e-commerce business. People order online and the product is shipped directly. Krecic uses Genesis Coffee Lab, a direct trade importing and roasting company in Alaska, to roast and ship the Ethiopian coffee his company sells. Therefore, both Genesis and Seven Weeks directly and positively impact coffee farmers in Ethiopia, known as the birthplace of coffee. Having a great mission is very important, but having a great product is equally as important, Krecic said. We want people to buy our coffee because they love the cause. but we want them to come back and buy it again because they really love the coffee. Pro-abundant life When people buy Seven Weeks Coffee, they not only help pregnancy resource centers, but also coffee farmers, Krecic said. We provide a coffee product that not only has an amazing impact supporting pregnancy care centers, but also has an amazing impact in uplifting farmers and the people who are processing the coffee back in Ethiopia, he said. Most coffees are untraceable, meaning you're not able to tell who farmed it or how much they got paid. There's a lot of undercut wages, even child labor involved, with some coffee suppliers. The direct trade relationship means we know exactly who is producing the coffee, exactly what they're getting paid, and they're actually getting paid twice as much as the fair-trade minimum. This is a totally new way to support farmers and impact them, providing legitimate wages for the farmers. He added, This is a pro-life coffee, pro-abundant life, from the farmers who grew the coffee in Ethiopia to the pregnancy care centers were able to support that provide free services. Krecic considers assisting pregnancy resource centers a partnership. A tab on the companys website guides center staff interested in the program. We just ask centers to just fill out their information, and then we set up a phone call with them to hear their needs and just kind of get to learn about what they're doing and what their needs are, Krecic said. We want to get to know them and understand what their needs are and that they would be willing to share this mission with their audience as well. It's kind of like a mutual partnership where they help share about the coffee and we can raise more money for them through our sales. Ten percent of every sale is a really significant portion of our profits, he added. This is a very transparent way to show exactly how much money we're giving away, simply moving the decimal place one spot over, Krecic said. Seven Weeks Coffee at the Jan. 2022 Students for Life of America Pro-life Summit Thus far, Seven Weeks Coffee has given 3,500 to pregnancy resource centers around the country. Krecic hopes to see that amount, and the number of centers helped, grow. We've had an amazing impact already, he said. I mean, 3,500 donated is so much more than we thought we'd ever do when we first started, but God has been blessing our efforts, and it's been amazing to support these centers and really help them out. Church and individual coffee with purpose He believes churches can join in the endeavor, and he hopes to grow his business through churches and thereby increase church support of pregnancy centers. I think churches can play a huge role in advancement of the mission, Krecic said. A lot of churches have coffee shops already or they're already serving coffee. Wed love to make an impact or make inroads and supply their coffee, to really transform their coffee shops into a pro-life ministry. We think this can have a huge impact on sharing the mission of what we're doing and also serve as a way to provide more funding for pregnancy care centers. Individuals and families who drink coffee can also make a significant impact on the pro-life movement just doing something they enjoy drink coffee. We're not asking for donations, Krecic said. Were simply saying If you drink coffee and will consider purchasing your coffee through us, you can have a tangible impact in supporting pregnancy care centers across the country as you drink your normal cup of coffee amid your normal morning routine. He said he likes to challenge people he meets with a question. Will you allow your coffee to serve a greater purpose? Just commit to drinking coffee through us. Lives will be saved, and that's the most amazing thing we can ever do support these pregnancy care centers. They save lives every day, Krecic said.

Terms and Conditions","Seven Weeks Coffee, founded by Anton Krecic, is a pro-life coffee company dedicated to supporting pregnancy centers. Inspired by the size of a seven-week-old fetus, roughly the size of a coffee bean, Krecic aimed to combine his passion for pro-life values with a business model that also benefits others. The company donates 10% of each sale, approximately $1.69 per bag, to pregnancy centers. Since its inception in November 2021, Seven Weeks Coffee has contributed to 10 centers, helping them meet various needs, such as opening new locations or acquiring ultrasound equipment.

The business, based in Virginia, operates both through events like the National March for Life and Pro-Life Summit and an e-commerce platform. It partners with Genesis Coffee Lab, a direct trade company based in Alaska, to source its Ethiopian coffee. This collaboration ensures farmers are paid significantly more than the fair-trade minimum and eliminates concerns of exploitative labor practices.

Seven Weeks Coffee prides itself on its dual impact—providing high-quality coffee while supporting both pregnancy care centers and coffee farmers. Krecic emphasizes the importance of both a strong mission and a great product to attract repeat customers. Customers not only support pro-life causes but also contribute to the well-being of coffee farmers through transparent, fair trading.

Krecic views supporting pregnancy centers as a partnership. The company allows centers to apply for assistance via its website, where Krecic personally engages with them to understand their needs. So far, the company has donated $3,500 to various centers. Krecic is particularly interested in expanding the reach of his business through churches, which could transform their coffee shops into pro-life ministries, further increasing support for pregnancy centers.

Shmerling, MD, Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing, and Alison Shmerling, MD, MPH, Contributor Here are some headlines on fertility and diet that caught our attention The ultimate fertility diet We reveal what to eat and what to avoid Here's what to eat if you're trying to get pregnant Trying to get pregnant? Foods to eat and avoid to boost fertility Wow! Who knew that your choices at tonight's dinner buffet could transform you into a parent? Not so fast let's look at the new study that's causing all the fuss. A new study of fertility and diet Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School have just published a review of past studies that examined the impact of diet on fertility. Here's what they found. For women trying to become pregnant naturally without ""assistive reproductive technologies"" such as in vitro fertilization, the following vitamins and nutrients were linked to positive effects on fertility folic acid vitamin B12 omega-3 fatty acids healthy diets such as the Mediterranean diet On the other hand, antioxidants, vitamin D, dairy products, soy, caffeine, and alcohol appeared to have little or no effect on fertility in this review. Trans fat and ""unhealthy diets"" those ""rich in red and processed meats, potatoes, sweets, and sweetened beverages"" were found to have negative effects. Studies of men have found that semen quality improves with healthy diets as described above, while the opposite has been linked with diets high in saturated or trans fat. Alcohol and caffeine appeared to have little effect, good or bad. Importantly, semen quality is not a perfect predictor of fertility, and most studies did not actually examine the impact of paternal diet on the rate of successful pregnancies. For couples receiving assisted reproductive technologies, women may be more likely to conceive with folic acid supplements or a diet high in isoflavones plant-based estrogens with antioxidant activity, while male fertility may be aided by antioxidants. So what does this mean if you're trying to get pregnant? Considering the average couple trying to become pregnant naturally, this review seems less of a bombshell than the headlines might suggest. Yes, eating a healthy diet is a good idea for men and women. Extra folic acid, B12, and omega-3 fatty acids might be helpful for women, but healthy diets are already recommended to everyone, and a prenatal vitamin which includes folic acid and vitamin B12 is already recommended for women trying to get pregnant. Folic acid supplementation has long been known to reduce the risk of developmental neurologic problems in the developing fetus. Unanswered questions about diet and fertility Even if we accept these findings as important enough to direct our dietary choices, we still need to answer some basic questions How much folic acid or B12 is best? Is there an advantage to taking a supplement rather than relying on dietary sources? Which sources of and how many servings of dietary omega-3 fatty acids are best? How should a woman balance the risk of fish contamination with toxins such as mercury? Are there some people who need to pay more attention to these dietary recommendations than others? What about other components of the diet? Fear not, researchers are hard at work looking at this question. For example, consider the results of three other recently published studies Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages especially sodas or energy drinks was linked to lower fertility for men and women, while drinking diet soda and fruit juice had no effect.Women who consumed high amounts of fast food and little fruit took longer to become pregnant than those with healthier diets.Couples eating more seafood were pregnant sooner than those rarely eating seafood. Most pregnant women consume far less than the recommended 2 to 3 servings of lower-mercury fish such as salmon, scallops, and shrimp per week. You can probably come up with more questions. Hopefully, researchers are already busy trying to answer them. In the meantime Until we know more, the take-home message of this new research is not so different than before it was published. If you're a man or a woman trying to become a parent, eat a healthy diet. Many doctors recommend that women of childbearing age who are not using contraception take a prenatal vitamin daily. At the very least, women who are planning a pregnancy should take a prenatal vitamin at least a month before trying to conceive. A higher than usual dose of folic acid may be recommended for certain women, depending on the medications they take and other medical conditions they have. Doctors also recommend the following to maximize the chances of a healthy pregnancy Try to maintain a healthy weight prior to conception. Obese women have a higher risk of complications. Avoid excessive vitamins before conception. Too much vitamin A, for example, can be bad for a developing fetus. Consider seeing your doctor for a ""preconception"" visit to review what you can do to optimize your chances of a successful pregnancy. For example, certain medications are harmful to the developing fetus and should be stopped well before planning a pregnancy. And just in case it's not obvious, don't rely on research regarding diet and fertility to prevent pregnancy. An unhealthy diet and avoiding supplemental vitamins or omega-3 fatty acids is not a form of birth control.

Sign me up","The article “Fertility and Diet: Is There a Connection?” by Robert H. Shmerling, MD, and Alison Shmerling, MD, explores the relationship between diet and fertility. It presents findings from a review of studies conducted by Harvard researchers that investigate how diet influences fertility, both for women and men.

Key findings include:
	1.	Positive Impact of Specific Nutrients: For women trying to conceive naturally, vitamins like folic acid, B12, and omega-3 fatty acids, along with healthy diets (such as the Mediterranean diet), have been linked to better fertility outcomes. However, antioxidants, vitamin D, dairy, soy, caffeine, and alcohol had little or no impact on fertility.
	2.	Negative Effects of Unhealthy Diets: Diets high in trans fats, red and processed meats, and sugary foods or drinks were found to negatively affect fertility, especially for women.
	3.	Men’s Fertility: Healthy diets, similar to those recommended for women, were associated with improved semen quality. Diets high in saturated or trans fats were linked to lower sperm quality, though alcohol and caffeine did not have significant effects on male fertility.
	4.	Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART): For couples undergoing ART like in vitro fertilization (IVF), women may benefit from folic acid supplements or diets high in plant-based estrogens (like isoflavones) and antioxidants. Male fertility in these cases might also improve with antioxidants.
	5.	Dietary Considerations: The article emphasizes that, while eating a healthy diet is generally beneficial, it may not be a quick fix for fertility issues. For women, taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid and B12 is recommended even before trying to conceive. The benefits of dietary omega-3s and B12 supplementation are still under investigation, and there’s concern about the risks of contaminants like mercury in certain fish.
	6.	Additional Research: Other studies have linked high consumption of sugary drinks and fast food to longer times to conception, while eating more seafood may help couples conceive sooner.

Practical Takeaways:
	•	For women planning to conceive, a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid and B12 is advisable, and maintaining a healthy diet is crucial.
	•	Maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding excessive vitamins (like vitamin A), and consulting with a healthcare provider about preconception health is recommended.
	•	While diet plays a role in fertility, it should not be seen as a substitute for medical intervention or birth control.

The article concludes that maintaining a balanced diet is essential for both men and women trying to conceive, but more research is needed to clarify optimal dietary practices and supplementation."
Texas IVF treatments can continue after Supreme Court ruling | The Texas Tribune,"Texas IVF treatments can continue after Supreme Court ruling The Texas Tribune Skip to main content Investigations Guides Newsletters Events Data About Donate Menu Close Key coverage Immigration Law Air Pollution House Freedom Caucus Teen Contraception SXSW Boycott Texas Abortion Restrictions IVF treatment can continue under Texas current abortion law, experts say Doctors and legal experts say Texas anti-abortion laws havent yet affected fertility treatments, and it appears an unlikely target for anti-abortion groups in the state for now. by Mara Mndez July 13, 2022 Updated July 15, 2022 Share Copy URL Republish Twitter Facebook Reddit LinkedIn Email Doctor Katarzyna Koziol injects sperm directly into an egg during an in vitro fertilization IVF procedure called Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection ICSI at Novum clinic in Warsaw on Oct. 26, 2010. Credit REUTERSKacper Pempel Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Abortion bans across the country have thrown into question the fate of in vitro fertilization, an expensive medical process that helps people become pregnant. But experts and anti-abortion groups say Texas laws shouldnt apply to IVF treatment, and clinics across the state are proceeding with the procedures for now. Similar to other trigger laws enacted to ban abortion after the U.S. Supreme Courts reversal of Roe v. Wade, a Texas law passed last year broadens the definition of an unborn child to begin at fertilization and include embryonic stages. That type of language can raise questions about the personhood and rights of embryos in IVF and other fertility treatments, said Dr. Natalie Crawford, who is co-founder of Fora Fertility in Austin. In IVF, Crawford said, doctors use hormone injections to save more of a womans eggs during a menstrual cycle and take them out to fertilize them with sperm in a lab. The eggs are then allowed to grow into a blastocyst, or an implantation-stage embryo. Crawford said this allows doctors to select the embryo they believe has the highest chance of success for a pregnancy to put back inside the womans uterus and save the other embryos so patients can try again or grow their family in the future. Doctors can also use these embryos to test for genetic diseases. Once a person or couple no longer need the embryos, they decide whether to discard them as medical waste, donate them for scientific research or to donate them to another couple, she said. Its this step in particular that is posing a question for IVF treatments in the face of abortion bans. The thing that were the most uncertain about is, could it impact discarding embryos, like when somebody is done with their family and they have remaining embryos? Crawford said. Or if they have genetically abnormal embryos, could it potentially make it harder to discard those? Some also worry about doctors ability to conduct genetic testing. Right now, Crawford and other fertility doctors in Texas and other states are continuing IVF treatments because most laws against abortions focus on embryos during pregnancies, not outside of the womb. While they contain phrases like every stage of human development, or from the moment of conception, which makes us nervous, they are written in a statute that is clearly about terminating an established pregnancy, said Sean Tipton, chief policy and advocacy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine broke down trigger laws across the country, based on its lawyers analysis, and says Texas trigger law does not appear to be applicable to IVF and reproductive medicine services prior to implantation of embryos. The ASRM found that similar laws in 11 other states most likely exempt IVF and assisted reproductive technology from abortion bans, but its lawyers warned Utahs laws could be interpreted to have an impact on assisted reproductive technology under a provision against the intentional killing or attempted killing of a live unborn child through a medical procedure. The statute mostly focuses on pregnancies, but the term live unborn child is left undefined and could allow people to argue that discarding an embryo or donating an embryo for research use is an intentional or attempted killing of a live unborn child, according to ASRMs analysis. In Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma, attorney generals offices have clarified anti-abortion laws should not have implications for IVF, but Idahos attorney general said it would be up to local prosecutors to decide how to enforce the states trigger law, according to NBC News. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtons office did not respond to a request for comment from The Texas Tribune. Tipton said ASRM and its members also worry courts may interpret these laws differently and about possible changes as state Legislatures reconvene. We can't speak to what state legislators are maybe gonna do in the next six months or a year and a half, he said. Texas trigger law is expected to go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a formal judgment overturning Roe v. Wade, following its late June opinion against the landmark 1973 decision that had established constitutional protections for abortion. State Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake who first introduced the legislation, did not respond to a request for comment. In the meantime, the Texas Supreme Court has said the states 1925 anti-abortion statutes, which were challenged in Roe v. Wade, can go back into effect because they were never repealed by the state Legislature. Those statutes were written before the first IVF baby was born in 1978, but they also focus on pregnant women and outlawing acts in which an embryo is destroyed in the womans womb. Two of Texas most well-known anti-abortion groups Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life also say the states laws and more recent definition of abortion should not affect or inhibit IVF treatment, even if they include the term embryo. Abortion is, according to Texas law, causing the death of the child, who is a child of a woman known to be pregnant, John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life, said pointing to a statute the Legislature amended a few years ago outlining what counts as an abortion. There's also no such thing as an abortion outside of a woman's womb, so when you look at what's happening in the laboratory with assisted reproductive technology, that is not destruction of an embryo, he added. This language likely leaves IVF treatment intact, legal scholars told the Tribune. A district attorney could decide to try to test the issue by bringing a case against a fertility doctor, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But he added that challenging IVF doesnt appear to be an area ripe for action in the anti-abortion movement. Seago said Texas Right to Life has concerns about the destruction of excessive embryos, particularly in medical research, but the issue is not one of its priorities for Texas 2023 legislative session. Instead, its priorities include enforcing existing laws against abortion and providing more support for pregnant women. Rebecca Parma, a senior legislative associate for Texas Right to Life, previously said the group does eventually want to expand protections for embryos in IVF, but she also said it would not be in the upcoming legislative session. Ultimately, we believe that all human life is valuable and deserves our legal protection from that beginning moment of fertilization, whether that occurs through normal means or through IVF. And so certainly we want those embryos who are created through the IVF process protected, she told Spectrum News1 in Austin. But, I think its going to be a process. I dont think its something thats going to happen next legislative session because obviously, IVF is something that is part of our culture and something that I think is pretty near and dear to a lot of people who desire families and desire children. Amy ODonnell, a spokesperson for the Texas Alliance for Life, said the group had not finalized its legislative priorities yet, but said the group supported a law passed in 2017 requiring the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to post information on its website about embryo donations to other people to promote the option. A bill filed in 2019 aimed to ban state agencies from contracting with vendors affiliated with destructive embryonic stem cell research, human cloning and abortions, but the legislation didnt gain traction. In Louisiana, embryos are stored because the state outlaws the destruction of embryos unless they fail to develop further over a 36-hour period, Tipton said. Crawford, the co-founder of Fora Fertility in Austin, said most people keep their embryos for several years, and in some cases up to 20 years, but they may decide to discard them after reaching their desired family size or after a divorce or death of a partner. And while donating embryos to other patients can be an option, some people may not be comfortable with that, she said. That is a personal decision for most of us, she said. An embryo does not exist as a person without a uterus to be implanted in, and that is what biology tells us all the time because many embryos do not implant and do not go on to become people. For now, Crawford said she is advising her patients to not rush to transfer their IVF treatment to other states without abortion bans because transporting embryos is not without risk of itself. Instead, she says patients should sit tight and watchfully wait.

Wade, the fate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) has come into question in states with strict abortion laws, including Texas. However, experts and anti-abortion groups indicate that Texas’ anti-abortion laws are unlikely to significantly impact IVF practices at this time.

Texas’ 2021 law, which bans abortion after fertilization and defines an unborn child as beginning at fertilization, raises concerns about the treatment of embryos in IVF. In IVF, eggs are fertilized in a lab, and the resulting embryos are either implanted in the uterus or preserved. The law’s broad language has raised concerns about the potential for stricter regulation of embryo handling, such as discarding or donating unused embryos for research. However, many experts argue that the law mainly targets pregnancies, not embryos outside the womb.

The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has clarified that Texas’ trigger law, which would go into effect if Roe v. Wade were overturned, likely does not apply to IVF, as it primarily addresses abortion after pregnancy implantation. ASRM also noted that other states with similar laws, like Arkansas and Oklahoma, have indicated that IVF procedures are unaffected. However, there are concerns that local prosecutors could test these laws in the courts.

Texas anti-abortion organizations, such as Texas Right to Life and Texas Alliance for Life, do not see IVF as a major target in the near term. While these groups believe that embryos created via IVF should be protected, they have prioritized enforcing existing abortion laws and do not foresee major efforts to regulate IVF embryos in the upcoming legislative session. However, they acknowledge the possibility of future legislative action on the matter.

In summary, while Texas’ abortion laws have raised questions about the regulation of embryos in IVF, experts and anti-abortion groups believe that the laws currently do not impact IVF practices significantly. Doctors continue to perform IVF treatments, but there is cautious monitoring of future legislative developments."

Since the early May leak of a U.S. Supreme Court draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the attorneys general write, charities that support pregnant mothers in need have been firebombed and pro-life organizations have been attacked almost daily and terrorized. Although the attacks began last month, it was only last week that the FBI announced that it would investigate them. Noting that the federal governments duty to protect its citizens against violence does not turn on the victims identity and that access to justice cannot turn on partisan affiliation, the letter calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously investigate and prosecute these illegal acts. Americans shouldnt fear for their lives for speaking up for what they believe in, AG Yost said. The First Amendment provides the right to speak freely, regardless of the topic and without fear of having your home, workplace or, worse, your life threatened. The letter urges the Department of Justice to begin its investigations with Janes Revenge, a pro-choice group that has declared open season on anti-abortion organizations, urging its members to paint, to burn, to cut, and to jam pro-life centers and advocates. Janes Revenge has claimed responsibility for attacks in Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The FBI has more than enough resources to determine the organizations members and to track down those carrying out these acts of violence, which qualify as terrorism under federal law, the attorneys general write. Yost and his colleagues even offer state assistance with the investigations. Differences of opinion are healthy, AG Yost noted, but how we handle such differences is key. In America, we solve our differences with debates and ballots, not with bricks and Molotov cocktails. Besides Yost, the letter was signed by the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia.

The letter was prompted by an increase in attacks against anti-abortion groups, including firebombings and daily harassment, following the May leak of a draft U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The letter criticized the lack of a federal response and accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) of political bias and neglecting its duty to protect citizens from violence, regardless of the victim’s stance.

The attorneys general called for a vigorous investigation into the violence, particularly by pro-choice group Jane’s Revenge, which had claimed responsibility for numerous attacks across the country. They emphasized that such violent actions qualify as terrorism under federal law and urged the DOJ to prioritize these investigations. The letter also offered assistance from state authorities, highlighting that Americans should not fear threats or violence for expressing their views.

This letter was signed by Yost and attorneys general from various states, including Alabama, Florida, Texas, and Virginia, among others. Yost reaffirmed that political disagreements should be resolved through peaceful discourse, not through violence."

The 13 U.S. states that have banned abortions rank among the worst states for overall child well-being. Project Details Date August 9, 2022 Author Linda A. Jacobsen Senior Fellow Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, there are nine states as of August 3 where abortion is banned in all or almost all cases. Four additional states have abortion bans after six weeks of pregnancy. Pro-life advocates in these states have emphasized the number of unborn babies who may now be saved. But there seems to be little or no focus on what happens to these babies after they are born. Will these saved babies and their families have the resources and support they need to lead healthy and economically secure lives? As a demographer who has spent the past two decades tracking trends in child well-being in the United States, two issues immediately come to mind 1 How successful are these states right now in supporting child well-being? 2 When will policymakers and pro-life advocates in these states shift their attention and resources away from merely preventing abortions to better meeting the needs of all at-risk children in their states? Before assessing child well-being in the states with abortion bans, it is helpful to quantify the total number of births and abortions occurring in the nation and these states. Table 1 provides these data for 2020 the most recent data available The number of births varied widely across these states, from a low of 10,960 in South Dakota to a high of 368,190 in Texas. The number of reported abortions also varied but should be considered in relation to the number of births in each state. Nationwide, the number of abortions was 26 of the number of births, meaning that if no abortions occurred in 2020, the total number of births in the United States could have increased by more than one-fourth 930,000 additional births.1 Across the 13 states, the ratio of abortions to births varied from a low of 1 or less in Missouri and South Dakota to a high of 34 in Georgia. If there had been no abortions in Georgia in 2020, then the total number of births in that state could have been more than one-third higher.2 In the absence of abortions, births could have increased by more than 170,000 15 in 2020 among these 13 states.

The Annie E. Casey Foundations recently released 2022 KIDS COUNT Data Book provides the timely data needed to assess child well-being across states. It looks at key measures such as the child poverty rate, the share of births with low birth weight, and each states overall rank for child well-being.3 Experiencing poverty in childhood has been shown to have lifelong consequences for health and earnings in adulthood. Child poverty in the 13 states with abortion bans ranges from 16 in South Dakota to 28 in Mississippi. Only two of the statesMissouri and South Dakotahave child poverty rates at or below the national average of 17. In 10 of the states with abortion bans, one-fifth or more of children live in poverty. Low birth weight less than 5.5 pounds is a leading cause of infant mortality and puts babies at higher risk of long-term health and developmental problems. The share of all births with low birth weight exceeds the national average of 8.2 in 11 of the 13 states that have banned abortion Texas and South Dakota are exceptions. In fact, at least one in 10 births had low birth weight in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In addition to child poverty and low birth weight, the 2022 KIDS COUNT Data Book provides 14 other measures of child well-being. The easiest way to compare states across all 16 measures is to look at the overall rank, which provides a summary measure of how each state is doing across four different domains of child well-beingeconomic, education, health, and family and community see Table 1. Five of the nine states that have banned all abortions rank among the 10 worst states for overall child well-being ranks of 41 through 50. Only Missouri and South Dakota rank among the top 30 states for overall child well-being, and none of the states with abortion bans ranks in the top 20. While these 13 states may be pro-birth, the evidence suggests they are not equally pro-child. With ongoing inflation causing soaring food prices, another important measure of child well-being is food insecurity. Lack of sufficient nutritional foodespecially at young agesputs children at higher risk for health problems and difficulties with learning in school. In early July, the Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey showed that among these 13 states, the share of households with children that sometimes or often did not have enough food to eat in the prior week ranged from a low of 13 in Missouri to a high of 27 in Louisiana see Table 2. In Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas, one-fifth or more of households with children were experiencing food insecurity. TABLE 2. Food Insecurity Among Households With Children Percent of Households With Children Who Sometimes or Often Dont Have Enough Food to Eat Notes Data are from June 29, 2022 to July 11, 2022. The listed states have banned abortion in most cases except Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee, which have banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Sources Annie E. Casey Foundation, KIDS COUNT Data Center and Guttmacher Institute, Interactive Map Abortion Policies and Access in the United States. With the low levels of child well-being in these 13 states today, what are the potential implications of an increase in births due to lack of access to abortion? If we assume that all abortions in 2020 were instead live births, and we apply the current child poverty and low birth weight rates to these births, the last two columns of Table 1 show the potential additional numbers of children in poverty and low birth-weight babies that could result. Nationally, there could be nearly 160,000 additional children living in poverty and more than 76,000 additional babies born with low birth weight. While the additional numbers of at-risk children may be quite low in Missouri and South Dakotadue to fewer abortionsthe numbers may well be considerably higher in states like Georgia and Texas. Note that these potential increases in the number of at-risk children are just for one yearthe number of vulnerable children could swell substantially over a five-year period in these states. Prior research has also found that women who seek abortions are disproportionately poor and low-income, so the poverty rate for births to families lacking access to abortion could be considerably higher. Its hard to be optimistic about the future for children in the 13 states that have already banned abortionthey rank among the worst states for overall child well-being. The evidence clearly shows these states have not invested sufficient resources to support their at-risk childreneven before banning abortion. Although some women in these states will succeed in obtaining abortions in other states, many may not, leading to an increase in the number of vulnerable children. If policymakers and pro-life advocates in these states continue to focus their resources primarily on anti-abortion efforts, they will fail to meet the needs of thousands of vulnerable children who require additional support to thrive. Notes 1 Of course, all prevented abortions would not have resulted in live births, but I make this simplifying assumption to assess the general impact for the nation and in each state. 2 Some of these abortions would likely still take place in other states with fewer abortion restrictions, but this figure provides an estimate of the upper limit of additional births that might occur. 3 Due to the issues of collecting data in 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau did not release child poverty rates from the American Community Survey ACS for 2020. Instead, the 2022 KIDS COUNT Data Book reports ACS five-year estimates for 2016-2020, which reflect both the pre-pandemic period and the first 10 months of the pandemic.

All Rights Reserved","The article discusses the implications of abortion bans in 13 U.S. states, which are among the worst for child well-being, despite being labeled as “pro-life” or “pro-birth.” After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, these states banned abortion, with some exceptions for cases after six weeks of pregnancy. Pro-life advocates focus on saving unborn babies, but the article raises concerns about what happens to these children once born and whether the states are prepared to provide adequate resources for their well-being.

Key points:
	1.	Child Well-Being in Abortion-Banning States: These states perform poorly on child well-being indicators like poverty, low birth weight, and overall health. Child poverty in these states ranges from 16% in South Dakota to 28% in Mississippi, with most states having poverty rates above the national average. Low birth weight, a leading cause of infant mortality, is also higher in these states compared to the national average.
	2.	Statistics on Births and Abortions: In 2020, abortions in these states could have led to a significant increase in births. For instance, in Georgia, the number of births could have risen by over 170,000 without abortions. The article calculates the potential for increased poverty and health risks, such as low birth weight, if these abortions do not occur.
	3.	Food Insecurity: Many of these states also struggle with food insecurity, with up to 27% of households with children in Louisiana reporting not having enough food. This further exacerbates the challenges children face in these states.
	4.	Child Well-Being Rankings: Five of these states rank among the 10 worst for overall child well-being, which includes measures of economic stability, education, health, and family/community support. These states lack the resources to adequately support children, even before the abortion bans were enacted.
	5.	Potential Impact of Increased Births: If all abortions in 2020 had resulted in live births, the number of children living in poverty could have increased by 160,000, with 76,000 more babies born with low birth weight. Many women seeking abortions may struggle to access them due to restrictions, leading to even greater numbers of at-risk children.

In conclusion, while the states banning abortion may be “pro-birth,” the article argues they are not “pro-child.” These states already face significant challenges in supporting the well-being of children, and without substantial investments in resources and support for vulnerable children, the abortion bans may exacerbate these issues."

Kim Reynolds signed the measure into law in front of 2,000 conservative Christians. The new legislation prohibits almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant. That's a dramatic shift for women in Iowa, where abortion had been legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signs into law a bill that will ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy during a visit to the Family Leadership Summit on July 14, 2023 in Des Moines, Iowa. Getty Images The ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed the legal challenge Wednesday and representatives spoke at the court hearing Friday. After the hearing, District Court Judge Joseph Seidlin said he could not imagine ""anything that would be more insulting to either side"" than for him to ""flippantly"" rule from the bench Friday.The split screen between Reynolds' signing and the court hearing punctuates a bitter battle between abortion advocates and opponents in Iowa that has dragged on for years and will likely, for now, remain unresolved.""As we gather here today, at this very moment, the abortion industry is in the court trying to prevent this law from taking effect and stop once again the will of the people,"" Reynolds said, before bringing lawmakers and others to the stage to sign the law. ""But the passage of this legislation by even a wider margin this times sends an unmistakable message.""The bill passed with exclusively Republican support late on Tuesday at the conclusion of a rare, 14-hour special legislative session. The new measure will be considered in the context of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and Iowa's Supreme Court last year, when both reversed themselves on rulings that had affirmed a woman's fundamental constitutional right to abortion.Those decisions prompted Reynolds to ask the court to reinstate her blocked 2018 law, which is nearly identical to the new one. The state's high court deadlocked last month, prompting Reynolds to call lawmakers back to the Iowa Capitol.""Patients' lives are deeply impacted every day that this law is allowed to stand,"" said Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States. ""Iowans will be harmed as they've lost the right to control their bodies and futures.""Planned Parenthood North Central States was planning to refer patients to other states, but remained hopeful there would not be a long interruption in services. As of Wednesday, 200 patients were scheduled for abortions at Iowa Planned Parenthood or the Emma Goldman Clinic this week and next, according to the court filings. Most of them already passed the six-week mark in their pregnancies.One Planned Parenthood clinic stayed open until about 930 p.m. Thursday in an effort to provide abortion care before the new restrictions, their attorney said.""I can only hope that all patients who had appointments this morning have gotten the care that they need and that they're not sitting at a health center right now,"" the clinics' attorney Peter Im said during Friday's court arguments.There are limited circumstances under the measure that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days incest, if reported within 145 days if the fetus has a fetal abnormality ""incompatible with life"" or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman. Most Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings.

Not Now Turn On","On July 14, 2023, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a law banning most abortions after approximately six weeks of pregnancy, marking a significant shift from the state’s previous 20-week limit. This legislation, which prohibits abortions once cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks (before many women realize they are pregnant), immediately ended access for many women, forcing clinics to refer patients to out-of-state providers.

The law, passed with strong Republican support, faces legal challenges from the ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States, and the Emma Goldman Clinic, which argue it violates constitutional rights. The state’s legal battle stems from earlier decisions by the Iowa and U.S. Supreme Courts, which reversed rulings affirming abortion rights, prompting Governor Reynolds to request the reinstatement of a nearly identical law blocked in 2018. A court hearing was held on July 14, but a ruling on whether the law would be temporarily halted was not expected until the following Monday.

While there are limited exceptions under the law—such as in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormalities, or risks to the woman’s life—Planned Parenthood clinics have already started referring patients to states with fewer restrictions. As of the law’s enactment, 200 women had appointments scheduled for abortion procedures that could no longer take place in Iowa due to the new restriction.

This legislative move is part of a broader trend in Republican-led states enacting stricter abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 overturn of Roe v. Wade, with many states now implementing bans or severe restrictions."

The North Carolina State Capitol Building in Raleigh. DreamstimeTNSABACAPRESSReuters CNN The North Carolina General Assembly on Tuesday gave final approval to a bill that includes some last-minute changes to the states recently passed abortion law. The Republican-controlled legislature sent the bill to the Democratic governors desk, just a day before a federal judge is set to hear a motion seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the abortion law from taking effect. The new law, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks, is set to go into effect on July 1. CNN has reached out to Gov. Roy Coopers office about his plans for the bill. The surprise amendment, which makes significant tweaks to the new abortion law, was added to House Bill 190, an unrelated measure focusing on the Department of Health and Human Services late last week in the state Senate. In a Tuesday filing in opposition to granting the temporary restraining order, on behalf of Republican House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, attorneys admitted that the changes contained in the amendment were addressing issues raised by the lawsuit. The Legislative Leaders respectfully request that the Court deny the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order TRO, and permit normal briefing on preliminary injunction issues, if any, that may remain, wrote W. Ellis Boyle, an attorney for Moore and Berger. The General Assembly is working to pass and enact, with or without the Governors signature, a technical and conforming bill to make changes to clarify and address most, if not all, aspects of Plaintiffs claims about the Act. The lawsuit filed earlier this month by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, along with other organizations and an OBGYN, claims the legislation contains several inconsistencies and vague language that could potentially violate constitutional rights. For example, the lawsuit questions whether a provision stating it is unlawful after the twelfth week of a womans pregnancy to advise, procure, or cause a miscarriage or abortion would prevent a person from legally providing information about how to obtain a legal, out-of-state abortion something the lawsuit says would be a First Amendment violation. The new amendment would remove the word advise from that portion of the laws text. Another measure that has been repeatedly highlighted in debate is language that regulates medication abortion. CNN has reported that while the law bans most abortions after 12 weeks into a pregnancy, it adds a separate, 10-week deadline for medication abortion in one section. The lawsuit notes that instructions for physicians providing medication abortions are contradictory. In one section, the Act states that abortion is lawful during the first 12 weeks of a womans pregnancy when a medical abortion is procured, but in another section, it requires physicians who provide medication abortion to verify the probable gestational age of the unborn child is no more than 70 days, or ten weeks. The amendment would strike the 70-days language from the law. State Attorney General Josh Stein is named as the lead defendant in the lawsuit, due to his role representing the state in challenges to state laws. However, Stein a Democrat who is running for governor said last week his office will not defend parts of the new law that he has determined are unconstitutional. In a weekend filing, Stein reiterated that he agreed with the plaintiffs that the law was unconstitutional, and referenced the recently passed amendments as evidence. S.B. 20 cannot satisfy this standardand the General Assembly has effectively conceded as much. Last week, the legislature introduced a series of amendments designed to revise many of the unconstitutional provisions identified in this lawsuit, wrote Stein in the filing. If those amendments are passed, they may remedy some of the constitutional violations that Plaintiffs allege. But unless and until the current law is repealed or significantly amended, immediate injunctive relief is necessary to avoid a due-process violation, he continued. Moreover, even if the legislatures proposed amendments do pass, at least one constitutional problem with S.B. 20 will remain even the currently proposed revisions to S.B. 20 fail to make clear that doctors in North Carolina can help their patients obtain abortions out of state. District Judge Catherine Eagles is set to hear the motion for the temporary restraining order Wednesday morning in Greensboro. Cooper has 10 days to take action on the amended House Bill 190. There are no line item vetoes in North Carolina, so to veto the amendment, he would have to veto the whole bill.

The amendments were added to House Bill 190, an unrelated measure, just a day before a federal judge was set to hear a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the law’s implementation on July 1. These changes aim to address legal concerns raised in a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and others, claiming that the law contains unclear and unconstitutional provisions.

The amendments specifically address issues like a provision that could restrict the ability to inform individuals about obtaining out-of-state abortions. The controversial term “advise” was removed from this section to clarify that such advice wouldn’t be prohibited. Additionally, the amendments sought to resolve contradictions related to medication abortions. The original law set a 12-week limit for most abortions, but separately imposed a 10-week limit for medication abortions, which led to confusion. The amendments removed the conflicting 70-day limit, aligning with the 12-week threshold.

State Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, has stated that his office will not defend parts of the law deemed unconstitutional. He agrees with the plaintiffs that the law violates constitutional rights, though he acknowledged that the amendments may address some issues. The lawsuit continues, with a judge scheduled to hear arguments about whether the TRO should be granted. Governor Roy Cooper, who opposes the law, has 10 days to act on the amended bill, but lacks the ability to veto individual provisions due to the state’s all-or-nothing veto system."
"Evers, Democrats call for repealing Wisconsin‚Äôs 1849 abortion ban ‚Ä¢ Wisconsin Examiner","Evers, Democrats call for repealing Wisconsins 1849 abortion ban Wisconsin Examiner HOME NEWS Politics Government Work the Economy Education Environment Civil Rights Immigration Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 645 News Story AbortionPolitics Government Evers, Democrats call for repealing Wisconsins 1849 abortion ban Proposal comes two weeks ahead of Supreme Court election By Baylor Spears - March 22, 2023 645 am Protesters at the Womens March rally marched a mile up State Street from the University of Wisconsin campus in subfreezing temperatures on Sunday, January 22, 2023. Photo by Baylor SpearsWisconsin Examiner. Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic lawmakers announced a bill Tuesday that would repeal Wisconsins 1849 abortion ban to effectively restore Roe in the state. The action comes two weeks before Wisconsins consequential Supreme Court Election. It follows Republicans announcement of a bill last week that would add rape and incest exceptions during the first trimester of pregnancy to the current abortion ban and clarify Wisconsins current life of the mother exception. Evers immediately rejected the GOP bill last week and recommitted to vetoing it, if necessary. Ive been clear from the beginning that I wont sign a bill that leaves Wisconsin women with fewer rights and freedoms than they had before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe, Evers said at the Tuesday press conference. Simply put, the Republicans bill doesnt cut it. The Republican bill was also rejected by the Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu R-Oostburg, saying further discussion wasnt necessary and it wouldnt be considered on the floor of the Senate. Democrats bill would repeal the 1849 law, which holds that any person except the mother who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child could be found guilty of a felony. The laws only exception is when a therapeutic abortion is performed by a physician to save the life of the mother. The bill would leave in place other abortion regulations in Wisconsin, many of which were passed following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Experts say these laws which include policies like requirements that physicians rather than nurses or midwives perform abortions, parental consent requirements for minors, the requirement that patients receive state-mandated informations and a ban on abortions after 20 weeks have limited access to abortion in Wisconsin for years. Were not talking about fringe ideas here. What this bill will do is simple. Itll restore access to safe, legal abortion in Wisconsin to what it was on June 23, 2022nothing more, and nothing less, Evers continued. Evers and Democrats first called for the repeal of the 1849 ban in June 2022 right before the announcement of the U.S. Supreme Courts Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization decision. Republicans gaveled in and gaveled out of the special session Evers called to consider the repeal without any discussion. The resurrected bill co-authored by Sen. Kelda Roys D-Madison and Rep. Lisa Subeck D-Madison is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Legislature this time around. Womennot politiciansare the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies, lives, and health, Roys said. Abortion is common, safe, and not controversial. Wisconsinites overwhelmingly want to see the rights we had under Roe v. Wade restored. A majority of Wisconsinites support broader access to abortion, according to polls conducted by Marquette University Law School. In a November poll, 55 of people said they opposed the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and 84 of people said Wisconsin should allow a woman to obtain a legal abortion who becomes pregnant as the result of rape or incest. As long as doctors face the threat of prosecution for providing basic reproductive healthcare, and as long as extremist Republicans continue putting politics ahead of our rights, patients will not have access to the abortion care they need in our state, Subeck said. In introducing the bill, Democrats are continuing to keep abortion in the spotlight, especially ahead of the April 4 election, which has increasingly become a referendum on abortion in the state. Republicans blocked an attempt by Democrats in January to put an advisory referendum on the April ballot asking voters whether Wisconsin should repeal the states criminal abortion ban. The state Supreme Court election with conservative former Justice Dan Kelly facing liberal Judge Janet Protaciewitcz could have massive impacts on future shape of abortion law in Wisconsin, especially with a case filed by Attorney General Josh Kaul moving through the judicial system that asks for clarity on state abortion law by declaring the 1849 ban unenforceable due to its conflict with statutes enacted after it. Evers backs the lawsuit. Lawmakers said at the press conference that it was imperative that clarity come sooner rather than later. We cant just sit and wait for the courts to act, Subeck said. We need clarity now. Evers said that the motivation behind the bill was to push for real debate on the issue. We have a bill, Evers said. Lets have a debate. The Republicans have their bill. The Democrats have their bill. People of Wisconsin should be able to hear a debate about this issue, not silence. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos R-Rochester criticized Democrats call for debate on Tuesday, saying Democrats are unwilling to compromise on the issue. The Democrats news conference was quite the spectacle, with Governor Evers hypocrisy on full display. Last week, Legislative Republicans introduced a bill thats a reasonable middle ground to the divisive and opposing viewpoints on abortion, Vos said in a statement. Evers immediately said he would veto it. Legislative Republicans have continued to say were willing to discuss and find consensus, Vos continued. Instead, Gov. Evers issues an ultimatum of no negotiating.

Jackson levels. This proposal comes just two weeks before Wisconsin’s critical Supreme Court election. The 1849 law currently prohibits abortion with limited exceptions, primarily to save the mother’s life. The Democratic bill would repeal this ban but retain other abortion regulations in Wisconsin, such as requirements for physician-performed abortions and parental consent for minors.

Evers strongly rejected a recent Republican proposal, which sought to add exceptions for rape and incest in the first trimester and clarify the life-of-the-mother exception. He emphasized that the Republican bill did not go far enough to protect women’s rights, and he would veto it if necessary. However, Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu dismissed the bill as unnecessary, claiming it wouldn’t be debated in the Senate.

The proposed Democratic bill, co-authored by Senator Kelda Roys and Representative Lisa Subeck, faces long odds in the Republican-controlled legislature. The Democrats argue that repealing the 1849 ban is vital for restoring reproductive rights and that the people of Wisconsin overwhelmingly support broader abortion access. Polls show significant opposition to the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and strong support for legal abortion in cases of rape or incest.

The bill’s introduction also highlights the increasing focus on abortion rights in the upcoming April 4 state Supreme Court election, which has become a referendum on the issue. Democrats are pushing for clarity on abortion laws, especially with a case filed by Attorney General Josh Kaul, which seeks to declare the 1849 ban unenforceable due to conflicting statutes. Evers supports the lawsuit, urging immediate action on the matter.

Assembly Speaker Robin Vos criticized the Democrats’ approach, accusing them of refusing to negotiate on abortion. He pointed to the Republican bill as a reasonable compromise, but Democrats remain firm in their stance, insisting on full restoration of abortion access as the only acceptable solution."

Statement from Chris Charbonneau, CEO Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Our doors remain open for care. Denying or delaying health care places an immediate burden on patients, their families, our communities, and the health system, and can have profound and lasting consequences. Abortion is an essential, time-sensitive medical procedure, as medical experts like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics Gynecology have recognized. Reproductive health providers are committed to the health of their communities. What matters most, even in a pandemic, is that providers are able to provide essential health care without barriers, while also flattening the curve in the community. Statement from Heather Gatnarek, ACLU-KY Staff Attorney It is outrageous that Attorney General Cameron and Kentucky politicians are trying to take advantage of a public health crisis to push their anti-abortion agenda. As trusted health organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have made clear, politicians should not push COVID-19 responses that cancel or delay abortion procedures. These national medical experts further explained that abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible. Everyones situation is different and it is critical that people be able to make their own decisions about continuing or ending a pregnancy, in consultation with their loved ones and their health providers. These politicians should listen to medical experts and stop playing politics with Kentuckians health. EMW's top priority is their patients safety and care. During this unprecedented time, EMW is following all guidance from public health experts to ensure that patients risk of coming into contact with COVID-19 are minimized, including instituting measures that allow for social distancing and screening patients for common COVID-19 symptoms prior to their receiving care.

Cameron sought to have Kentucky’s abortion providers certified as violating the ban on elective medical procedures. Both PPINK and ACLU-KY argued that abortion is a critical, time-sensitive medical procedure that should not be delayed, as postponing it could increase health risks or make it completely inaccessible. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, affirm that abortion care is an essential part of health care, even during a public health crisis.

Chris Charbonneau, CEO of PPINK, emphasized that denying or delaying abortion services places an undue burden on patients and the healthcare system. Heather Gatnarek, an ACLU-KY attorney, criticized the political maneuvering, accusing politicians of using the crisis to advance an anti-abortion agenda, despite expert medical guidance. Both organizations also highlighted that reproductive health providers are following public health measures, including social distancing and COVID-19 symptom screenings, to ensure patient safety. PPINK offers a range of services, including abortion care, to over 45,000 people annually across two states.

This statement reinforces the importance of maintaining access to essential healthcare services, including abortion, during the pandemic, and urges politicians to respect medical expertise and prioritize public health."

Tony Evers calls the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature into special session to create a pathway for a statewide vote to repeal the states 1849 ban on abortions at a news conference Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2022, in the governors conference room in the state Capitol of Madison, Wis. Scott BauerAP Photo Gov. Tony Evers unveiled a plan Wednesday that would let Wisconsin residents propose citizen ballot initiatives, calling the move a pathway to repealing Wisconsins 1849 ban on abortion.While its not the first time Evers has called on Republicans who run the Legislature to repeal the states pre-Civil War ban, the governors latest proposal would be more expansive, giving members of the public the power to pass state laws on any number of issues, from redistricting to marijuana legalization.If Republican legislators arent going to uphold the will of the people, then the people of the state should have the right to take a stand at the ballot box, Evers said at a state Capitol news conference. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPRs email newsletter. Email PhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Republicans who run the Legislature indicated almost immediately that they would reject the plan.Evers has repeatedly called special sessions of the Legislature to highlight issues where he and Republican lawmakers disagree. The latest came in June, when Evers called for a special session to rescind Wisconsins 1849 abortion ban. Weeks later, GOP leaders gaveled in and out of the session without taking any votes.The governors latest proposal may be headed for a similar fate, but its different from his last special session call and would represent a dramatic shift in how government works in Wisconsin. If it passed, it would let members of the public sidestep the Legislature and governor to pass laws on their own.Evers said Wednesday that GOP lawmakers should be open to the plan because U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently indicated he favored letting voters decide whether to add exemptions for rape or incest to the states abortion ban. Evers and Johnson, R-Wisconsin, are up for reelection in November.He said lets let the people take care of this, Evers said. And we agree with him.But in a statement issued shortly after the governor introduced his plan, GOP lawmakers gave every indication it was a nonstarter in the Legislature.Governor Evers would rather push his agenda to have abortion available until birth than talk about his failure to address rising crime and runaway inflation caused by his liberal DC allies, said Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg. Hopefully, voters see through his desperate political stunt.Evers scheduled his special session for Oct. 4.Because Evers plan would amend the state Constitution, it would first have to pass two consecutive sessions of the Legislature. That means lawmakers would need to pass the proposal this year, and then the next Legislature elected in November would need to pass the identical plan in 2023.The proposal would then go before voters in a statewide election to decide whether they want to allow for ballot initiatives in Wisconsin. The soonest that could happen would be 2023.If the governors plan passed each of those steps, it would open the door to future statewide referenda that dont require the Legislatures blessing.According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 24 states have a citizen initiative process that lets people bypass their state legislatures by placing proposed laws on the ballot. Twenty-three states let voters approve or repeal an act of the legislature. Under Evers plan, Wisconsin voters could do both.The number of signatures needed to place a question on the ballot would vary.An initiative to repeal a law passed by the Legislature would require signatures from at least 4 percent of the number of votes cast in the last election for governor, or about 107,000 people using the 2018 election as a benchmark. Proposing a new law would raise that threshold to 6 percent, or about 160,000 signatures. And getting a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot would require signatures from 8 percent of voters, or about 214,000 people.Voters in other states where ballot initiatives are allowed have put the power to use. In Michigan this year, voters will decide whether to put the right to an abortion in the states constitution. Other states are considering ballot initiatives this year to legalize recreational marijuana. And in 2018, voters in Colorado, Missouri and Michigan approved ballot measures calling for nonpartisan redistricting.Evers has proposed all three ideas, but theyve gone nowhere in the Legislature.You think about all the items that, in this state, polling shows the vast majority of people support, Evers said Wednesday. Any one of those would eventually be fair game.While other issues could eventually be on the table, Evers pitch Wednesday focused almost entirely on abortion rights, one of the centerpieces of his reelection bid against Republican challenger Tim Michels, who supports the states abortion ban without exceptions.In the most recent poll by Marquette University, 63 percent of registered voters said they opposed the U.S. Supreme Courts decision overturning Roe v. Wade. And 83 percent said they supported allowing a woman to obtain a legal abortion if she became pregnant as the result of rape or incest.While Evers cited Johnsons recent comments as a reason Republicans should support his special session, Johnson criticized the governor in a statement provided by his office.Once again, Democrats are seeking to divide the public by exploiting the profound moral issue of abortion by politicizing it before an election that should be focused on the disastrous results of their policies and governance, Johnson said. Because of the profound nature of this decision, we should not rush the debate, but instead allow enough time for a thorough and thoughtful discussion.Michels campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This plan, introduced on September 21, 2022, aims to bypass the Republican-controlled Legislature and give Wisconsin residents the power to create laws on various issues, such as redistricting or marijuana legalization, through statewide votes.

Evers has previously called for the Legislature to repeal the state’s pre-Civil War abortion ban but met resistance. His new proposal would allow citizens to place laws or amendments directly on the ballot by collecting signatures, potentially sidestepping legislative gridlock. To amend the Constitution, the proposal would need to pass two consecutive sessions of the Legislature, followed by a statewide vote. If successful, it would enable future ballot initiatives without requiring legislative approval.

The initiative process would be similar to systems in other states, such as Michigan, where voters have approved issues like abortion rights and marijuana legalization through ballot measures. Evers focused his pitch on abortion, noting public support for abortion access, especially in cases of rape or incest. In a recent poll, 63% of Wisconsinites opposed the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade reversal, and 83% supported legal abortion in cases of rape or incest.

Despite this, Republican leaders, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, rejected the proposal, calling it a political move ahead of elections. They criticized Evers for focusing on abortion instead of addressing other state issues, such as crime and inflation. U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, similarly criticized Evers for politicizing abortion ahead of the election, arguing that the issue required more thoughtful discussion.

If the amendment passes, it would allow Wisconsin voters to influence laws directly, a move that could lead to significant shifts in state policy on a range of issues, with abortion being a central focus."

Photograph Yuri CortzAFPReproductive rights This article is more than 3 years oldCovid-19 threatens access to abortions and contraceptives, experts warnThis article is more than 3 years oldUnplanned pregnancy rates have fallen globally, report finds, but coronavirus could endanger access to servicesSupported byAbout this contentLiz FordThu 23 Jul 2020 16.29 BSTLast modified on Wed 19 Oct 2022 16.46 BSTShareRates of unplanned pregnancies have fallen around the world, according to new data published by health research organisation the Guttmacher Institute and the UN Human Reproduction Programme HRP on Wednesday.Global rates of unintended pregnancies have fallen from 79 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 in 1990 to 64 in 2019, thanks in part to a concerted effort to increase access to contraceptives, but there are concerns that decades of progress in reducing the numbers risk being undone by Covid-19, as lockdown restrictions hamper health services.Zara Ahmed, a senior policy manager at Guttmacher, warned Covid-19 could reverse those declines due to challenges with the supply chain, diversion of providers to the response and lack of access to health facilities during lockdown.Ahmed said the pandemic was illuminating existing gaps in and strains on healthcare services, adding that some governments had already shifted resources away from basic sexual and reproductive services to Covid-19 responses.In April, Guttmacher predicted that just a 10 decline in services in poorer countries as a result of coronavirus restrictions could result in 15 million more unplanned pregnancies, 168,000 more newborn deaths, 28,000 more maternal deaths, and 3 million more unsafe abortions.Guttmacher and HRPs latest research, published in Lancet Global Health, found that women in the poorest countries were nearly three times as likely to have an unplanned pregnancy as women in the wealthiest countries 93 per 1,000 women in low-income countries compared with 34 in wealthy states.Europe and North America had the lowest number of unplanned pregnancies 35 per 1,000 women, while sub-Saharan Africa had the highest 91. Women in sub-Saharan Africa are among the least likely to have access to family planning.The research also revealed that 61 of unplanned pregnancies globally in 201519 resulted in an abortion, up from 51 in 1990. Despite a slight fall in abortion rates in the early 2000s, rates had increased over the past 15 years. Researchers said the trend could reflect increased access to abortion or a stronger motivation to avoid unintended births.Climate, inequality, hunger which global problems would you fix first? interactive quizRead moreThe majority of terminations occurred in countries where abortion is banned or restricted, researchers found, which meant they were more likely to be conducted unsafely. At least 22,800 women are estimated to die from an unsafe abortion each year.Ahmed said even where it was legal some countries had deemed abortion not to be an essential service during the pandemic and had restricted services. These service gaps could result in some individuals not being able to access abortion care at all, while others are forced to seek unsafe abortions, she said.The World Health Organization estimates that 270 million women who want modern contraceptives have no access to them. Universal access to family planning is a target of the sustainable development goals.A study published in the Lancet last week said increased access to contraception is crucial if new global population forecasts are to be realised. Researchers forecast the global population will be 2 billion below current UN predictions by 2100 if womens lives are improved.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsWomen's rights and gender equalityContraception and family planningHealthAbortionPregnancyFamilynewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFashionFoodRecipesLove sexHealth fitnessHome gardenWomenMenFamilyTravelMoneyNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved. dcr","The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on reproductive rights, particularly concerning access to abortions and contraceptives. While global rates of unintended pregnancies have decreased over the years, thanks to improved access to contraceptive methods, the pandemic threatens to undo this progress. Lockdown restrictions and health system strain have led to reduced availability of reproductive health services.

Experts warn that disruptions to the supply chain, reallocation of health resources to COVID-19, and limited access to clinics during lockdowns could significantly affect access to contraception and abortion services. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that even a 10% decline in reproductive health services in low-income countries could result in millions more unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and unsafe abortions.

The article highlights the stark contrast between low- and high-income countries, with women in poorer countries being nearly three times as likely to experience an unintended pregnancy. The research also points to rising abortion rates globally, particularly in regions where abortion is restricted, leading to unsafe procedures that contribute to maternal deaths.

Furthermore, the World Health Organization estimates that 270 million women lack access to modern contraceptives. The study also stresses that increasing access to family planning is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals and addressing global population challenges."

Share share Washington Last month's U.S. Supreme Court decision eliminating a nationwide right to abortion will heavily impact minority and low-income women, leading to worse outcomes along socio-economic lines, according to researchers, reproductive rights groups and civil rights organizations. ""The Supreme Court decision will disproportionately harm women and children of color, those living on lower incomes, including immigrants,"" National Urban League President Marc Morial told VOA. ""Our organization will continue to fight for the reproductive rights of women."" More than a dozen U.S. states have laws banning nearly all abortions that were activated when the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the United States. Many of those state laws are being contested in court. Other states are expected to enact new abortion bans, potentially leaving women without access to the procedure in vast swaths of the country. Several states with abortion bans tout social services and programs to help needy mothers. Anti-abortion groups say they, too, stand ready to help pregnant women of all races and economic conditions. ""Nearly 3,000 pregnancy centers across the country lovingly give hope and encouragement to expectant mothers and provide critical resources throughout pregnancy and after their child is born, typically at no charge,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, in a recent statement. The group also supports Louisiana's Women's Right to Know Law. It mandates that state agencies provide information on abortion alternatives, assist women during and after pregnancy, and that adoptive parents in many cases pay the medical costs associated with carrying a woman's child to term. More pregnancy-related deaths Even with such assistance, a recent study concluded that abortion bans would result in more deaths among Black women than any other racial group. The study, conducted last year by Duke University, estimated that pregnancy-related deaths among Blacks would increase by 33 in the years following an abortion ban, compared with a 21 increase for the overall population. ""By more women giving birth we can expect infant mortality to rise but it won't be felt equally because of racial disparities,"" said Lisa Harris, an obstetrician-gynecologist who teaches at the University of Michigan. Even before the Supreme Court made abortion access a state-by-state matter, Native American, Alaska Native, Black and other minority women were two to three times as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC.

Myriad factors go into the decision to seek the procedure, according to abortion rights defenders. ""An abortion is not something where it's either make a choice to choose to be a parent or not to choose to be a parent,"" said Oriaku Njoku, executive director of ARC-Southeast, a group that provides funding and logistical support for reproductive care based in Georgia, speaking on ABC News. ""There's so many things like access to food, access to a living wage, access to insurance, your race, your gender, your ability to make money for your family."" Georgia example Georgia is one of 33 U.S. states that ban the use of government Medicaid funds for abortions, putting a greater financial burden on low-income and minority women seeking the procedure. In 2019, Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed a bill banning most abortions in the state after six weeks of pregnancy. Kemp recently defended the law while hailing resources available to pregnant women in Georgia. ""We have worked hard to increase supportive services for mothers and their children before, during, and after birth,"" Kemp said in a statement. He highlighted ""expanding pregnancy and parental resources, extending health coverage to a full year for mothers after birth, improving our adoption system, and reforming foster care."" In Indiana, meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have proposed allocating 58 million to increase services for pregnant women, including 30 million to help low-income families under the Medicaid program. But abortion rights activists argue expanding social services is no substitute for maintaining a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. Both, they say, are needed. ""Improving access to health care, education and family planning are better ways to reduce unintended pregnancies than trying to restrict abortion,"" said Njoku. Biden administration responds Responding to the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, President Joe Biden signed an executive order in early July boosting federal efforts to ensure women's access to health care, including emergency medical services, family planning and contraception. The directive also seeks to protect women who travel across state lines for abortions as well as their access to medical abortions. ""We cannot allow an out-of-control Supreme Court . to take away freedoms and our personal autonomy,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. Anti-abortion groups remain mobilized as well. ""Our legal team will continue to file legal briefs as needed and advise lawmakers in all 50 states,"" said Americans United for Life in a statement. ""We are helping create over 400 pro-life bills in over 40 states and our legal experts are preparing to fight for the sanctity of human life in all 50 states.""

Wade, which eliminated the nationwide right to abortion, is expected to disproportionately affect minority and low-income women, particularly in states with restrictive abortion laws. Researchers, reproductive rights groups, and civil rights organizations warn that these women will face worse socio-economic outcomes as a result. Marc Morial, President of the National Urban League, emphasized that this decision will harm women of color, immigrants, and those with low incomes. Many states have enacted or are planning abortion bans, with some states offering alternative support for pregnant women, including pregnancy centers and social services.

However, critics argue that expanding social services, such as pregnancy and parental support, cannot replace the right to abortion. A Duke University study found that abortion bans could increase pregnancy-related deaths, particularly among Black women, who are already at a higher risk of such deaths compared to white women. The Guttmacher Institute notes that in 2020, over 900,000 legal abortions were performed in the U.S., and factors like access to healthcare, food, and financial resources are crucial considerations in the decision to seek an abortion.

In states like Georgia, where Medicaid funding for abortion is restricted, low-income women are disproportionately affected. Georgia has also passed laws restricting abortion after six weeks of pregnancy but claims to have increased supportive services for pregnant women. Similarly, Indiana’s Republican lawmakers have proposed funding to support pregnant women, including low-income families, but abortion rights advocates argue that both social services and the right to choose should be preserved.

In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling, President Biden signed an executive order to ensure continued access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion services, and to protect women traveling across state lines for the procedure. Anti-abortion groups are also mobilized, advocating for pro-life legislation in multiple states. Both sides continue to contest the future of abortion rights in the U.S."
"Indiana abortions drop significantly, despite pause on statewide ban ‚Ä¢ Indiana Capital Chronicle","Indiana abortions drop significantly, despite pause on statewide ban Indiana Capital Chronicle HOME NEWS Commentary Education Economy Government Politics Health Environment Election 2024 ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 700 News Story Indiana abortions drop significantly, despite pause on statewide ban Abortion care providers attribute the decreases to public confusion and dwindling clinic staff. By Casey Smith and Whitney Downard - March 15, 2023 700 am Abortion care providers say patients are confused about whats allowed and whats not, adding that such bans create a chilling effect and discourage people from seeking out the procedure in Indiana. Staff shortages are additionally limiting the ability of Hoosier clinics to provide abortions. Getty Images Abortions in Indiana spiked in the months following the Dobbs ruling, but the number of procedures happening across the state has since dropped nearly 50, according to newly released state data. The first three months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Indiana clinics submitted an average of 1,048 terminated pregnancy reports each month, according to Indiana Department of Health IDOH data obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. But those abortion reports dropped sharply between October and January, averaging just 552 terminations per month. That is well below monthly averages for previous years. State lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban in August, but the procedure remains legal in Indiana while the law is being challenged in court. Under an injunction, the states previous abortion law stands allowing abortions up to 20 weeks. Still, providers say patients are confused about whats allowed and whats not, adding that such bans create a chilling effect and discourage people from seeking out the procedure in Indiana. Staff shortages are additionally limiting the ability of Hoosier clinics to provide abortions. Planned Parenthoods Indianapolis clinic that provided the largest number of abortions in 2021 hasnt performed abortions since at least the end of February. The organization didnt respond to requests about the matter but the website for the Georgetown Road location says it is providing only abortion referrals. Even for the folks who are following this and are aware of the injunction, its still confusing. Dr. Katie McHugh Dr. Katie McHugh, a licensed gynecologist in Indianapolis who provides abortion care, attributed much of the decline to uncertainty surrounding Indianas laws and whether the ban is still in effect. We still have patients coming in or calling into the clinic saying, Where do I go? Can you refer me to a place out of state? And were like, Sure. But we can also see you here, she said. Even for the folks who are following this and are aware of the injunction, its still confusing. McHugh said she and other abortion care providers operate in a sort of legal limbo, where the anticipated decision from the Indiana Supreme Court could alter their practice indefinitely. Its very complicated when youre trying to schedule patients, when youre trying to place supply orders on medicine if you dont know if you can literally provide care tomorrow, McHugh said. Katie Blair, advocacy and public policy director for the ACLU of Indiana who has filed two lawsuits against the state ban said Although abortion remains legal, in the past decade, the Indiana General Assembly has enacted more than 50 abortion restrictive laws. These laws, combined with the looming ban that is now held up in the courts can make it more challenging for providers to offer reproductive care, and more difficult for women to access the care they need. By the numbers In July, August and September, seven abortion care providers licensed in Indiana reported more than 1,000 pregnancy terminations each month, while abortions over the same time period in 2021 averaged just under 700 per month. The state health department hasnt yet released its full 2022 report, meaning the latest comparable numbers are from 2021. The newest data provided by IDOH also only reflect when reports were submitted not necessarily when the procedures were performed. But providers have 30 days to file the paperwork. In the late summer months, part of the demand came from neighboring states with restrictive laws on abortion, McHugh said. As laws changed, so has the demand. Indiana Department of Health received the following terminated pregnancy reports July 2022 1035 August 2022 1081 September 2022 1030 October 2022 446 November 2022 605 December 2022 755 January 2023 405 Other states that were previously banned now have injunctions in place so that care is accessible, McHugh said, highlighting Ohio. Most abortions were illegal in Ohio as soon as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in late June. Several Ohio clinics challenged the law, which started once embryonic cardiac activity could be detected around six weeks. A court issued an injunction on that ban in October. Over the summer, Indiana made national news after a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio sought abortion care in the Hoosier State. The child was one of potentially hundreds of Ohioans who left their home state to seek abortion care providers. As Indiana grappled with its own new restrictions, reported abortions fell to half the previous months reports, from 1,030 in September to 446 in October even though abortion in Indiana was only illegal for about a week. The 405 terminated pregnancy reports submitted in January 2023 is roughly half of the 793 terminations reported for January 2021. IDOH doesnt have February numbers yet, prolonging uncertainty about the impacts of the temporary closure of the Planned Parenthood location on the north side of Indiana in late February. That clinic alone performed more than one-quarter, or 29, of all the states abortions in 2021. Planned Parenthood, which operates four of the seven clinics providing abortion services, did not respond to multiple Capital Chronicle requests for comment. Womens Med Group Professional Corporation of Indianapolis, the clinic performing the second highest number of abortions in Indiana, performed 27 of the states procedures in 2021. The location similarly told the Capital Chronicle it needs to train more staff but declined to give an interview before publication. Both clinics, along with Whole Womans Health Alliance, were part of the lawsuit that paused the states near-total abortion ban. Those bans, according to Whole Womans founder and CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller, only kept people from accessing safe abortions in their communities. The same amount of people still need access to safe abortion abortion bans dont change the number of people that have unplanned pregnancies, Hagstrom Miller said. Its not reducing the need, its just making people have to travel farther and oftentimes pushing them further into their pregnancy. Meanwhile, Indiana Right to Life CEO Mike Fichter said his group suspects Indiana briefly became an abortion destination in the months following Dobbs, especially for women coming from Ohio and Kentucky. Both of these states had strong pro-life laws in effect almost immediately after Roe was overturned, yet Indianas new law did not go into effect until mid-September, and then just briefly, before it was blocked in court, Fichter said in a written statement. Had the legislature not tightened Indianas abortion law in last years special session, there is little doubt abortions would have continued to skyrocket in our state. Help Wanted at abortion clinics As the availability of abortion wavered, doctors made other plans. Illinois became a hotspot, as the sanctuary state saw demand surge as all of its neighbors pursued bans. Pushed out of their home states, many physicians opted to license in Illinois and other states. McHugh, for her part, chose to license in Ohio and Maryland. We are all still in Indiana, though many of us have also become licensed in other states and are providing abortion care in other states, McHugh said. That is not necessarily the reason for decreased access, that is more a function of the instability around whether abortion will remain legal in Indiana. As a licensed doctor, McHugh said she had flexibility that other staff didnt including positions at other clinics and health services beyond abortion. It is very difficult to keep staff at the front desk or people to help take vitals, McHugh said. Those employees need to make sure they have a steady and stable income to feed their families and pay their bills. It is very different for us to ask these low-paid but dedicated employees to continue to show up for a job that may not exist next week. Hagstrom Miller, with Womans Health, reported the same staffing difficulty. One staffer relocated to Virginia while another took a different position within the company. Since the ban passed, the clinic hasnt always been able to schedule appointments and closed intermittently. People want to be sure they have a stable income for their families, Hagstrom Miller said. I think all clinics are navigating this. The South Bend clinic, located at the Michigan border and roughly 90 minutes from Chicago, has the option to divert patients elsewhere if they cant get scheduled in Indiana, including a virtual option in Illinois. Sometimes I call this the era of uncertainty. Theres a lot of uncertainty because we dont know how long we can promise somebody work and we dont know how long well be able to be open, Hagstrom Miller said. Were waiting for the final decision from the lawsuit. McHugh also doesnt expect relief soon so long as the abortion ban or lack thereof remains uncertain. But she said clinics have the responsibility to train their staff to ensure the safety of the procedure which has a complication rate far below childbirth, especially in states like Indiana that have a high maternal mortality rate. We want to make sure that patients are safe that the employees are supported with the education and the training they need, McHugh said. Hagstrom Miller wants Hoosier women to know that the clinics abortion care providers can still connect people to services, including funding and travel support. We are still answering our phones were helping Hoosiers either get medication abortion by mail in Illinois, to travel to Indianapolis where clinics might be open or travel to Illinois or Michigan, Hagstrom Miller said. The one promise we know we can keep to our patients is that were going to answer those phones and were going to give you the most current information.

Wade, despite a legal injunction temporarily halting the state’s near-total abortion ban. After the ruling, Indiana saw an initial spike in abortion procedures as people from neighboring states with stricter laws sought care in the state. However, by late 2022 and early 2023, the monthly number of reported abortions dropped by nearly 50%, from an average of 1,048 in the months following Dobbs to just 552 per month between October and January.

This decline is attributed to a combination of factors: confusion over Indiana’s fluctuating abortion laws, which are currently in a legal limbo, and significant staff shortages at clinics. Many clinics, like Planned Parenthood’s Indianapolis location, have suspended abortion services, with some only providing referrals. Abortion providers are also dealing with legal uncertainty, which makes scheduling and staffing difficult. For example, some doctors have sought licenses in other states, like Illinois, to ensure job stability.

The uncertainty around abortion access has caused confusion among patients, with some unsure if the procedure is still available in the state. This has led to fewer people seeking care in Indiana, even as abortion remains legal under a court injunction. Additionally, neighboring states like Ohio, which initially had strict bans, have begun allowing more access through legal challenges, further reducing demand in Indiana.

The decrease in services is also tied to the inability of clinics to maintain a stable workforce. Many clinic staff, particularly in lower-paid roles, have left due to instability and uncertainty about the future. This staffing issue has led to closures and difficulties scheduling appointments, which are exacerbated by the possibility that the legal status of abortion could change at any time.

Despite these challenges, organizations like Whole Woman’s Health Alliance continue to provide referrals and support for patients, including offering travel assistance to those needing care out of state. They emphasize that the need for abortion services remains, even if bans prevent local access."
"Betty Cockrum, longtime leader of Indiana's Planned Parenthood, dies","Betty Cockrum, longtime leader of Indiana's Planned Parenthood, diesNews North Sports Indy 500 Things To Do Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals NEWSBetty Cockrum, longtime defender of abortion rights in Indiana, diesCrystal Hill Shari RudavskyIndianapolis StarBetty Cockrum, the public face of abortion rights in Indiana for years who was considered by many to be a passionate and thoughtful mentor, died over the weekend, her family said Tuesday. She was 67.The Hoosier native led Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky for 15 years before retiring in June 2017. Friends and allies regarded her as a force of nature and passionate champion of women's reproductive rights.""She had the strength of a hundred women and spoke for thousands of us,"" said Vi Simpson, a former Indiana state senator and decades-long friend of Cockrum.Her family said she meant many things to many people. Countless lives touched, careers built, families supported, jobs created, storms weathered and mountains moved,"" the family said in a statement. ""While she was busy changing the world for the better, for us, she was just Mom.Cockrum spent decades in politics, according to friends, family and former colleagues. Before Planned Parenthood, Cockrum served as a state budget director and head of the Department of Administration and earlier as Bloomington's city controller after working for the Bloomington Redevelopment Department. Betty ran a tight ship at Bloomington City Hall and brought street smarts and passion to state government in every job she took on, John Goss, former deputy mayor of Bloomington, said in a statement.In 1997 when Gov. Frank OBannon became governor, he tapped her to be the commissioner of the Department of Administration at the recommendation of his chief of staff, Tom New. Cockrum wanted a job in the governors office, but New recognized there were many issues that needed to be handled and Cockrum was the person to do it.Her calm but commanding voice and steady demeanor led people to listen to what she had to say, New said.So many times Gov. OBannon would say, Get Betty on the phone, have Betty come here to the office, he said. She put out a lot of fires and did it often behind the scenes and did it very quickly and did with a lot of class.Cockrum also connected personally with many of the people with whom she worked.Cheryl Reed, OBannons deputy press secretary, met Cockrum when the two worked across the hall from each other. Cockrum, who dubbed her Creed in a nod to her email address, invited Reed to attend the Estro-fests Cockrum hosted.At these events, Cockrum would gather a group of her female friends to hang at her home downtown.She tried to nurture and grow women as a force for good,"" Reed said. ""She would bring together all of these women she knew, anyone she knew that she felt had something positive to add to the world.Helping friends in needIf a friend needed her, Cockrum always seemed to know just what to say. After Reed had a miscarriage, Cockrum reached out, but recognized that Reed would not appreciate a long extended conversation. Cockrum said simply, ""Listen, Creed, youre going to get through this.""She would step in and say her piece if that was what you needed, Reed said. Sometimes she would go the extra mile to do that.Although Cockrum and New had not seen each other for some time, Cockrum went out of her way to show up last fall at the calling for News fiancee.I hadnt seen Betty, and all of sudden she just popped in, he said. It sort of brought tears to my eyes that she would drive up to Noblesville just to express a few kind words to me during a very difficult time.The champion of Planned ParenthoodCockrum, though, is likely best known for her role as the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood. During her tenure Indiana politicians approved waves of anti-abortion legislation, attempted to pull federal and state dollars from health centers and instituted stricter requirements for abortion facilities and doctors.Planned Parenthood sued the state five times during her tenure, at least twice successfully.Chris Charbonneau, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, called Cockrum a trailblazer.She was a true force of nature as she championed abortion access for decades, and her leadership continued even after she retired from Planned Parenthood,"" Charbonneau said in a statement. ""During her time at Planned Parenthood, Betty was persistent and never intimidated as she forged ahead in the fight to ensure that everybody regardless of income or zip code has access to affordable, expert reproductive health care.Cockrum told IndyStar in 2017 that her job became more political after she started.""You couldn't have told me 15 years ago how different it is today,"" she said at the time near her retirement. ""Everything we fought for in the '60s, so much of that, it's already eroded, and it's under attack.""Cockrum pushed a host of initiatives, including making emergency contraception available over the counter, allowing Planned Parenthood patients to use Medicaid for health care services and expanding beyond abstinence-only education.But opponents viewed Planned Parenthood as too focused on abortion.Protesters often crowded her lawn, once saying, ""You're a sicko, Betty! You're killing babies, Betty Cockroach.""Deborah Simon, who served as president of the board of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, said Cockrum rarely had her family visit her home because of the protesters.She didnt want her kids to be exposed to it she protected them, Simon said. But she wasnt going to give up the fight just because there were a bunch of protesters in front of her house.Simpson said she feared for Cockrum's safety at times. But she added that her friend was strong and undeterred. Simpson said she wants her friend to be remembered for her ""grace and strength under fire.""""It was a lesson I learned from her,"" Simpson said. ""And all of us can learn something from her. When you're talking about hot issues that are politicized in the way that reproductive health has been politicized over the years, it is so easy to see it in black and white. And be hateful or spiteful toward people who don't think the same way you do. And Betty, although she felt passionate and strongly about these issues, she never let that interfere with her doing her job, doing what she thought was the right thing to do.""Still a mentor after retirementHaving grown up poor, Cockrum saw Planned Parenthood as a way to get health care to people who needed it, Reed said.But after about 15 years Cockrum decided to step down from the job which by then had become head of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky.In her retirement, she relished the opportunity to spend more time with her grandchildren and to help with a number of local Democratic causes, Simon said.Nor was she only interested in politics. Recently she had embraced the Indianapolis Art Center as a cause, Reed said.Earlier this spring she hosted an afternoon event at the facility for about 30 of her friends, including her young granddaughter. She invited them to bring pieces of broken jewelry, sip mimosas and learn how to fix the baubles.It was typical Betty,"" Reed said, ""trying to have people learn about something she cared about.The youngest of eight children, Cockrum was born March 25, 1953, in LaGrange County, her family said.

Cockrum was widely admired as a passionate advocate for women’s reproductive health, and during her 15 years leading Planned Parenthood, she fiercely defended abortion access, even as the state passed restrictive laws. She was known for her calm leadership, tireless work, and ability to navigate political challenges, including successfully suing the state multiple times over anti-abortion measures.

Before leading Planned Parenthood, Cockrum had a distinguished career in government, serving as the budget director, head of the Department of Administration, and city controller of Bloomington. Friends and colleagues remembered her as a mentor, compassionate listener, and strong woman who was dedicated to improving the lives of others. She also made personal connections with those around her, often stepping in to support people during difficult times.

Her time as a leader in Planned Parenthood was marked by her efforts to expand healthcare access, fight political opposition, and make services like emergency contraception more widely available. Despite facing protests and threats, Cockrum remained steadfast in her beliefs and led the organization through turbulent times.

In retirement, she spent time with her grandchildren and supported local causes, including the Indianapolis Art Center. Cockrum, the youngest of eight children, grew up in a poor family and viewed Planned Parenthood as a vital resource for those in need. She is survived by her two sons and four grandchildren, with her family requesting donations in her honor to the Julian Center for victims of domestic violence."

This assessment identified broad health system challenges that must be addressed to achieve universal health coverage in the area of sexual and reproductive health. It also pinpointed key interventions for countries to prioritize, including sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents.During 20 and 22 October 2020 WHO and the United Nations Population Fund UNFPA will organize a sub-regional consultation on sexual and reproductive health in Central Asian countries. The outcomes of the country assessments on sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health as well as how to ensure access to sexual and reproductive services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic will be key topics of discussion during this online event.Republic of Moldova sets an exampleThe Republic of Moldova was the only country included in the WHOEurope assessment that offers comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services for young people. It established youth-friendly clinics in every district and municipality between 2002 and 2017.These 41 clinics offer free counselling services to young people aged 1024, and are staffed with multidisciplinary teams of specialists including gynaecologists, urologistsandrologists, internists, dermato-venereologists, midwives, nurses, psychologists and social workers. Adolescents also receive free contraceptives and HIV testing.In addition to the network of clinics, efforts are underway to set up mobile teams to provide clinical outreach services to adolescents in villages.Dr Galina Leco, Head of the National Resource Centre on Youth-friendly Health Services Neovita in Chisinau, coordinates the national youth-friendly clinic network. She says that the Ministry of Healths commitment along with donor support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC, the United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF and WHO have been decisive in strengthening services specifically for teenagers.The first 3 pilot centres were opened with the financial support of UNICEF Moldova. The SDC played an essential role in extending the network during the past decade. Thanks to WHOs technical support, a scaling-up concept for youth-friendly services was established, explains Dr Leco.We receive extraordinary support from WHO and appreciate how we are continuously guided in the development of service-quality standards and in implementing innovative approaches, such as collaborative learning.Positive trends, legislative challengesAccording to the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study in the Republic of Moldova, in the last 5 years the fertility rate of those aged 1519 has decreased by 25, and abortions in this age group have decreased by 20. The number of abortions among minors has nearly halved in the last 3 years, from 243 in 2016 to 141 in 2018.Another positive development is seen in several studies indicating that the proportion of 15-year-olds who have started having sex decreased from 18 in 2014 to 13.3 in 2018. Also, the use of the contraceptive pill among sexually active 15-year-olds increased from 6 in 2014 to 10 in 2018.However, several challenges remain. The incidence of HIV among young people has stayed the same in recent years, and condom use among sexually active young people aged 1517 is inconsistent. Insufficient financial support for youth clinics is an additional concern.Every year we have significant personnel losses due to the poor financial situation in the country, says Dr Leco. Many health workers from the Republic of Moldova migrate to other countries with the hope of securing higher pay and improved working conditions.Dr Leco is keen to review Moldovan legislation related to the age of consent to access health services. The current legislation requires parental consent for those aged 16 years and under. The criteria for assessing the decision-making capacities of a young person should change so that, under certain conditions, young people can have easier access to quality services, she says.The WHO assessment also showed that not all health providers know about the relevant regulations or how to apply them in young peoples best interests. One of the assessments policy recommendations is that legislation on adolescents right to access to sexual and reproductive health services without parental consent be clearly communicated to all health workers to ensure that it is understood and applied uniformly across different levels of care. It is also essential that young people know their rights and entitlements.Reaching every young person, in every villageA big problem right now is that young people from small, remote villages are embarrassed to ask for the help they need in the regular local health services, adds Dr Leco. The plan to create mobile teams will address this issue and ensure privacy and confidentiality in small communities.The teams will consist of nurses and volunteers who regularly visit the communities based on an established programme. Like this, young people will benefit from more confidential services, for free, she explains.Ms Alina Racu, a young woman from Criuleni in the central part of the country, confirms that a lot of work remains to inform young people in small villages about sexual and reproductive health and the possibility of accessing services in the youth-friendly clinics.Many young people in villages dont know about the basic methods of contraception and dont know where to go for help, she says. Most of them look for solutions on social networks, like Facebook, Odnoklassniki or other sites. Its totally different when you go to a qualified specialist, who explains in detail the risks, challenges and ways of protecting yourself. Its very important for teens to know about these centres and not be afraid to ask for qualified help on time.Making a difference in young livesMany health professionals at the youth-friendly clinics have modest working conditions and low salaries. Despite such challenges, they find gratification and great value in their work.I will never forget when our centre, Neovita, celebrated its 10-year anniversary. A young girl came to the reception and I saw from her clothes and appearance that she probably lived on the streets. She wanted to make an appointment with a gynaecologist at the recommendation of her friend, who had visited the centre earlier. This friend had a mental health issue and had needed an abortion when she was 14 years old, remembers Dr Leco.I realized that if this young girl convinced a friend to visit us now, it means that when she was here, she felt safe with us, thought of us as friends and received the help she needed. This makes us proud of our achievements, no matter how small they may be.The outcomes of the assessment of sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in the context of universal health coverage in 6 countries, including the Republic of Moldova, are available through the link below. Quick links Help Contact us Careers Cyber Security Privacy s Privacy Legal Notice 2024 WHO","The Republic of Moldova has made significant strides in providing sexual and reproductive health services to young people, setting an example for other countries in the WHO European Region. Between 2002 and 2017, Moldova established 41 youth-friendly clinics across the country, offering free counseling and medical services, such as contraceptives, HIV testing, and support from multidisciplinary health professionals like gynecologists, psychologists, and social workers. The clinics cater to adolescents aged 10–24, with the goal of improving access to sexual and reproductive health services, particularly for those in rural and remote areas.

The success of this initiative has been supported by international organizations, including the Global Fund, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), UNICEF, and WHO, which helped fund and expand these services. Despite challenges such as insufficient financial support, youth clinic staff migration, and legislative barriers related to age of consent, the program has seen positive outcomes. For instance, the fertility rate for 15–19-year-olds in Moldova has dropped by 25%, and the number of abortions in this age group has decreased by 20% in recent years. Additionally, the proportion of 15-year-olds who have initiated sex has decreased, while the use of contraceptives among sexually active teenagers has increased.

However, challenges remain, including inconsistent condom use, stagnant HIV rates among youth, and insufficient financial resources for sustaining the clinics. There are also concerns about the legislative framework, which currently requires parental consent for minors under 16 to access health services. WHO’s assessment has recommended clearer communication of adolescents’ rights to access these services, especially in cases where parental consent might be an obstacle.

To address privacy concerns, Moldova is planning to create mobile teams of healthcare workers to provide outreach services in villages, where many young people still feel uncomfortable seeking help at local health centers. Despite these challenges, the work at youth-friendly clinics is making a tangible difference in the lives of young people, providing them with essential services and fostering a sense of safety and trust. The positive feedback from youth in rural areas, like Alina Racu from Criuleni, highlights the need for continued education and outreach on sexual and reproductive health.

Sue Glick said Tuesday, especially in areas where they struggle to receive primary care.Glick, who sponsored the states abortion ban, called the bill a furtherance of the bills we heard this summer.We have individuals who have been referred to their primary physicians or to a primary physicians. Many of them dont go to the doctor, they cant afford it or they dont have access, she said before the 28-20 vote. This is an effort to give care to individuals who need it. Its an effort to help these individuals have healthy families at their time. If approved by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, pharmacists could be reimbursed for their services to Medicaid patients. They would also be able to object to prescribing the medications under ethical, moral, or religious grounds.

Eric Holcomb signs proclamation condemning antisemitism while vetoing bill defining it After dangerous tornadoes in Ohio and Indiana, survivors salvage, reflect and prepare for recovery Prescriptions, however, cannot last more than six months, and pharmacists cannot prescribe a contraceptive to a woman after twelve months unless the woman has been seen by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant in the past year. If you are against abortion, you ought to be for contraceptives, Republican Sen. Vaneta Becker said before voting for the bill.To opponents who want birth control to only be prescribed by physicians, the bill is unequivocally lowering the standard of care, Republican Sen. Tyler Johnson said Tuesday. The emergency medicine doctor also questioned whether access to birth control would decrease abortions in Indiana.State legislatures across the U.S. have introduced at least 30 bills related to birth control access this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy earlier this year signed a law that would allow women in the state to receive some hormonal contraceptives without a prescription. That law goes into effect in May. While the Indiana legislature seeks avenues for contraceptive access, the states abortion ban remains on hold pending a decision from the Indiana Supreme Court. Abortion clinic operators filed a lawsuit against the ban, which has not been enforced since September.But the drive for pharmacist-prescribed birth control has cropped up in Indiana before this year most recently this summer, when Democratic Rep. Rita Fleming introduced an amendment with such language into a spending bill for low-income women and children that lawmakers advanced alongside the abortion ban.That amendment fell short by one vote.We were awfully close then, Fleming told the Associated Press on Tuesday. I think the good of providing this for women in a safe manner is incredibly important. A House committee earlier Tuesday also unanimously approved a bill that could allow long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices, to be transferred between Medicaid patients, something that is currently prohibited.If a Medicaid patient does not return for an insertion appointment after 12 weeks for a device they requested, a medical provider could reissue that contraceptive to a different patient, under the bill, which now goes to the full House.Providers do not typically keep the implant devices on the shelf because of their high costs, leaving thousands of dollars of these unclaimed, Democratic Sen. Shelli Yoder, the bills author, said Tuesday.Health care providers are only able to recoup that cost after its inserted or implanted, she said. The only thing they can do is wait. And if they expire, they throw them away.This story was first published on April 11, 2023. It was updated on April 14, 2023, to correct the type of access to birth control in the Indiana bill. It would be available with a pharmacists prescription, not over the counter. Arleigh Rodgers is a corps member for the Associated PressReport for America Statehouse News Initiative. Report for America is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues. Follow her on Twitter at Arleigh Rodgers Indiana statehouse and education reporter mailto","Indiana lawmakers are considering new bills aimed at improving access to birth control, including a proposal to allow pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives. This move comes in response to the state’s abortion ban, which was enacted last summer but has not been enforced due to a pending decision from the state Supreme Court. The bill, introduced by Republican Sen. Sue Glick, seeks to make birth control more accessible, especially in areas where healthcare access is limited. If signed into law by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb, pharmacists could prescribe birth control, with some limitations: prescriptions would be valid for no more than six months, and after 12 months, a woman would need to consult a healthcare provider.

Opponents of the bill, including some Republican legislators, argue that it could lower the standard of care, while others, such as Republican Sen. Vaneta Becker, support the bill as a pro-life measure, linking birth control access to reduced abortion rates. This proposal reflects broader national trends, with states like New Jersey also exploring ways to make contraceptives more accessible without a prescription.

In addition to the birth control measure, the Indiana legislature is also considering a bill to allow the transfer of long-acting reversible contraceptives like intrauterine devices (IUDs) between Medicaid patients. Currently, unused devices are discarded, leading to unnecessary waste. If passed, this measure would allow these devices to be reallocated to other patients, addressing both cost concerns and supply shortages. These legislative actions reflect ongoing efforts in the state to navigate the intersection of abortion policy and reproductive health care."

President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a March for Life rally, Friday, January 24, 2020, on the National Mall in Washington. Patrick SemanskyAP Editors Note Terry Schilling is the executive director at American Principles Project, a conservative nonprofit think tank. Follow him on Twitter Schilling1776. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his. View more opinion at CNN. CNN On Friday, Donald Trump became the first President to speak in person at the March for Life in Washington. This is a really big deal. Terry Schilling Courtesy of Terry Schilling Every year, hundreds of thousands of pro-life demonstrators come together in our nations capital to commemorate the anniversary of the Supreme Courts wrongly decided Roe v. Wade decision and demand political action that would protect the right to life for the unborn. Now in its 47th year, the march has become the premier event of the pro-life movement. Trumps historic appearance was a boon for marchers, as it helped draw increased attention to the event and highlight the pro-life movements considerable political success in recent years. It also presents an enormous opportunity for him to reach the many Americans who are on the fence about abortion by drawing a contrast with the extreme positions of his 2020 Democrat opponents. While abortion rights proponents love to cite polling data showing that the vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade, the reality is that many Americans also reject the abortion on-demand including at a late stage of pregnancy, in some cases regime created by that ruling. A Gallup poll last year showed that a majority of Americans support restrictions on late-term abortion. Nevertheless, in recent years, too many on the left appear to have abandoned any sort of moderate consensus on the issue, with the pragmatism of safe, legal and rare in some cases even giving way to the ideological purism of shout your abortion, presumably hoping no one in middle America would notice. Pro Life supporters gather at the Washington Monument to hear Vice President Mike Pence speak at the March for Life rally on January 27, 2017 in Washington,DC. Tasos KatopodisAFPGetty Images Related article Open your eyes, pro-life feminists are everywhere Unfortunately for the Democrats electoral hopes, the American people did notice, and the Republicans are taking advantage politically. We saw a prime example of that in 2016, when Trump highlighted Hillary Clintons extreme position on abortion in their third presidential debate If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that thats OK and Hillary can say that thats OK, but its not OK with me Thats not acceptable. At the time, Clinton said Trump was using scare rhetoric she had said in earlier comments that she believed mothers should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy at any point up until birth if her life is in danger. But just last year, Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York invited heated controversy by supporting legislation that would legalize abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy the week at which a live birth may be viable when the life or health of the mother is in jeopardy or if the fetus would be unable to survive outside of the womb. That same radical position has also been embraced by the national Democratic Party, and no current 2020 Democrat candidate with the exception of Tulsi Gabbard has indicated they would support restrictions on late-term abortions. Theres no doubt all this extreme ideology may be popular among the wokest progressive activists on Twitter, but it is decidedly not among many Americans. Indeed, a new KFF poll found that fully half of Republicans think it is too easy for women to access an abortion. As a candidate, Trump recognized the political wisdom of engaging on this issue, and as President, he has continued to call out Democrats over their views on abortion, notably condemning Virginias Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam last year for his comments on a radio show about a bill before the Virginia House of Delegates, which some initially construed as supporting infanticide. Northams spokeswoman later said his comments were intended to address the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor. Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinions new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook Even more importantly for Fridays marchers, Trump has achieved a number of pro-life accomplishments in his first term such as signing a bill that would allow states to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, and appointing right-leaning justices to the Supreme Court and, if re-elected, is promising to do even more in his second. Now as the 2020 race approaches, the March for Life offered Trump the perfect chance to make abortion a defining issue of the campaign. He can point out how 2020 Democrats are arguing for few restrictions on abortion but also for funding by taxpayers as well, for women on Medicaid. He can draw attention to how Democrats in Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation that would compel doctors to provide lifesaving treatment to babies who have survived abortions. Opponents said one recent bill was unnecessary because a similar law already exists, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002. All of these contrasts should strongly benefit him with voters even outside his pro-life base. As the Democrats impeachment spectacle falls flat, President Trump has positioned himself to respond by attacking them on what is perhaps their weakest ground, unveiling their true priorities for all American voters to see.

CNN Sans 2016 Cable News Network.","In the opinion piece, Terry Schilling highlights President Donald Trump’s historic appearance at the March for Life in Washington, making him the first sitting president to speak at the event. The March for Life, a pro-life rally marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, has become a key moment for the pro-life movement. Schilling emphasizes how Trump’s participation drew attention to the growing political success of pro-life advocates and presented a significant opportunity for him to contrast his views on abortion with those of his 2020 Democratic opponents, who, according to Schilling, hold more extreme positions on abortion rights.

Schilling argues that while polls suggest most Americans support Roe v. Wade, many also oppose late-term abortion, with a Gallup poll showing that the majority favor restrictions on abortions performed later in pregnancy. He criticizes the left for shifting away from a more moderate stance of “safe, legal, and rare” to an extreme position that embraces unrestricted abortion, even at late stages, which he claims is unpopular among many Americans. He points to controversies such as Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s support for legislation allowing late-term abortions and how no leading Democratic candidates, except Tulsi Gabbard, have voiced support for restrictions on late-term abortions.

Schilling also praises Trump for his actions on the issue, including signing a bill defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing conservative judges to the Supreme Court. Trump’s consistent criticism of Democrats over their abortion stance, such as condemning Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s comments on abortion and infanticide, is seen as a strategic move to solidify his pro-life base and appeal to a broader electorate. Schilling concludes that the abortion issue is likely to play a central role in the 2020 election, with Trump using it to highlight the contrast between his pro-life stance and the Democrats’ more permissive approach to abortion."
Opinion: Is it possible to be pro-life and pro-choice?,"Opinion Is it possible to be pro-life and pro-choice?Local News Sports Opinion For Subscribers NKY Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals OPINIONOpinion Is it possible to be pro-life and pro-choice?Susan VogtOpinion contributorI am a pro-life Catholic. But before you put me in an ideological box and assume you know who I will vote for this fall, let me complicate the issue.My conscience and faith lead me to oppose abortion. Indeed, Catholics are taught not to take the life of an unborn child. However, Catholic or not, this is a moral question which women facing an unwanted pregnancy have to wrestle with. There are indeed, situations in which even a rigorist conscience might pause when faced with rape, incest, or risking the death of the mother.Add to this that we live in a pluralistic society. One groups religious and moral convictions should not be imposed on another without broad societal consensus. Our country does not have consensus about abortion. Therefore, the emphasis should be on persuasion and compassion rather than seeking a political solution to abortion like overturning Roe v Wade.It is not honest to talk about being pro-life without also talking about what Cardinal Joseph Bernardin called ""the Seamless Garment,"" or the Consistent Ethic of Life. Of course, this includes opposition not only to abortion, but also taking a life through euthanasia, capital punishment and unjust war. Equally unacceptable are failures to protect life by tolerating poverty, racism, lack of affordable health care and similar societal injustices that threaten the lives and dignity of human beings.Thats a tall order, but to be pro-life one must stand in solidarity with all humanity and work to protect all life. Unfortunately, too often the loudest voices against abortion are weak on protecting the lives of vulnerable human beings after they are born.Would it not be better toPrevent unplanned pregnancies through education and reliable family planning?Persuade those who want to overturn Roe v Wade that there are better ways to support women and protect human life.Support women facing a crisis pregnancy by providing financial and emotional support not only to give birth but also to raise their child to adulthood and providing adoption services This is already broadly done.Care for women who chose abortion but who now are seeking peace and reconciliation through programs like Project Rachel.The evidence is that such holistic caring for pregnant women and children reduces the abortion rate more than restrictive laws.So, is it possible to be pro-Life AND pro-choice? First, this is a false binary choice. Being pro-choice does not equal favoring abortion. It remains a tragic choice.The answer, however, I believe, is simple and complex Who is my neighbor? If my neighbor is everyone, then how do I love, respect and protect their lives and dignity? To be pure about protecting human life means that I have to respect all human lives born and unborn.In order to be a fully pro-life voter I propose askingWho among our candidates has the more comprehensive understanding of protecting life both unborn and born? Society must reckon with the causes.What will you do to decrease the demand for abortion?As regretful as abortion is, I believe the decision rests within the conscience of the pregnant woman. This should not primarily be a legal issue, but a moral one. It must be won by persuasion and support, not law.Susan Vogt lives in Covington and was employed for over 25 years as a Family Life Minister in two Catholic dioceses, including responsibility for overseeing the pro-life work of the Diocese of Covington.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Cincinnati Enquirer Store Licensing Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Sports Betting Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events 2024 All rights reserved.","In her opinion piece, Susan Vogt explores the complexity of being both pro-life and pro-choice, suggesting that these positions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As a pro-life Catholic, Vogt personally opposes abortion due to her faith and conscience, but acknowledges that this is a moral decision for the women facing an unwanted pregnancy, particularly in difficult cases like rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. She argues that abortion is a deeply moral issue that should not be determined solely by political decisions, as the U.S. lacks a broad societal consensus on abortion.

Vogt invokes Cardinal Joseph Bernardin’s “Seamless Garment” approach, which opposes not only abortion but also euthanasia, capital punishment, and unjust wars. She emphasizes the need for comprehensive approaches to life, which include combating societal issues such as poverty, racism, and lack of healthcare. Vogt criticizes those who oppose abortion but fail to advocate for vulnerable populations after birth, pointing out that being truly pro-life involves protecting all human life, not just the unborn.

She proposes practical solutions to reduce abortion, including preventing unplanned pregnancies through education and access to family planning, supporting women facing crisis pregnancies with emotional and financial help, and providing care for women who regret their abortion decisions. These actions, according to Vogt, are more effective in reducing abortion rates than restrictive laws.

Vogt ultimately suggests that being pro-choice does not mean endorsing abortion but recognizes it as a tragic choice that should be made by the pregnant woman based on her conscience. She believes that this decision should be influenced by persuasion, care, and support, rather than by legal restrictions. The core question for a pro-life voter, she argues, should be which candidates have a comprehensive understanding of how to protect all life, born and unborn, and how they aim to decrease the demand for abortion."

And their Declaration changed the course of human historythat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it. But after we won our independence as nation, our Founders failed to ensure everyone was free. And nearly 90 years later, our fight for freedom continued on through the abolition movement, a bloody Civil War, and then decades of marching in streets to ensure full citizenship for Black Americans. This was our second fight for freedom. Friends, I believe it was no mistake as to why our founding fathers listed LIFE as the very first of those God-given rights in the Declaration of Independencefor without life, none of our other rights matter. Abortion advocates want to claim that they are defending freedom of choicewhat we call violence, they call a womans right to choose. But no one has a right to choose death for another innocent human being. The Founders understood that freedom can only survive within the constraints of justice. If a king, slave holder, or even an abortion facility . can take away a persons life at will, then no ones rights are truly secure. And when the protection of these rights become disordered, with ones pursuit of happiness or liberty preceding anothers right to life the result has always been the same devastation resulting in subjugation to a foreign crown, slavery for those of a different skin color, and, since 1973, death for those whose existence is an inconvenience. So, today, on this the 49th anniversary of handing down of the Roe v. Wade Doe v. Bolton decisions, which together legalized abortion in all nine months of pregnancy, I propose to you that it us, our generationeach of us born after 1973 who all could have been aborted for the mere price of a playstationwho have been called to launch what will be the third and final fight for freedom in our nation. To end the predatory lies and violence of the abortion industry. To serve every woman and family in crisis on our campus and in our community with hope, love, and tangible support. To protect every baby and their very first freedomthe right to be born, no matter their genetic code, race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or circumstance of conception. To ensure Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton never see their 50th anniversary. To accomplish our full mission of making abortion unthinkable and unavailable in our lifetime. To finally make good on our Founders promise of a nation devoted to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for every citizen, without exception. No matter their age, size, location, development, or circumstance. And as we anxiously, impatiently await the Supreme Court decisions in the Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization case this June, a decision that may very well throw Roe v. Wade on to the ash heap of history, right where it belongs right alongside Dred Scott and Plessy, and launch the next legal phase of the anti-abortion movement from Washington, D.C. to every state capitol. Its time for us to work harder than weve ever worked before. At Students for Life, I proud to say that this Pro-Life Generation is a diverse army, thats more than 1300 campuses and more than 100,000 supporters strong. Every day, you have the most mind-changing conversations with those most-directly targeted by the abortion industrys create-a-customer business model.

She noted that the Declaration of Independence highlighted “Life” as the first unalienable right, asserting that without life, other rights are meaningless. Hawkins criticized abortion advocates who claim to defend “freedom of choice,” arguing that the right to choose does not extend to taking the life of an innocent human being. She highlighted the historical context of the abolition movement and the Civil War as pivotal struggles for freedom, claiming that the fight against abortion is the next chapter in America’s fight for true liberty.

Hawkins framed the pro-life cause as a “third and final fight for freedom,” targeting the abortion industry’s predatory practices and advocating for the protection of the unborn. She urged the attendees, primarily students, to work toward making abortion both unthinkable and unavailable, emphasizing the need to create a society where every life is protected regardless of circumstances. Referring to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade through the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, Hawkins called for continued activism and engagement, both on college campuses and in local communities. She also highlighted the expansion of chemical abortion pills as a new threat and encouraged attendees to take action by sharing educational resources and joining efforts to support women in crisis pregnancies.

Ultimately, Hawkins’ speech was a call to action, urging the next generation to continue the fight for life and freedom, echoing the founders’ call for a nation committed to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens. She closed by pledging her honor, fortune, and life to the cause, emphasizing the importance of the moment in history and the significance of the pro-life movement’s mission."

But pro-choice doctors in Malta are leading the charge with the first ever pro-choice advisory service which, they say, will be fighting the spread of misinformation by anti-choice groups who attempt to dissuade women from seeking out the adequate services. As front-line pro-choice organisations, we came face to face with some of the dire situations that women in Malta experience. Unfortunately, we also came across situations where women in Malta were given wrong information or even tricked by local anti-choice pregnancy helplines, Doctors for Choice member, and psychiatrist Christopher Barbara said. Barbara said the restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic had limited womens access to abortion, apart from witnessing a rise in domestic abuse cases and the temporary inaccessibility of certain types of contraception. Doctors at work Chris Barbara centre at the first pro-choice gathering. Maltas pro-choice doctors have done much to raise the level of debate on abortion to a more, medically-based and rational discourse This service does not in any way absolve the State from its obligations, but at least women in Malta can now find reliable and unbiased information on sexual and reproductive healthcare and options without fear of judgement, Barbara said of the Family Planning Advisory Service FPAS. The FPAS is being billed as a service that is filling a gap of advice sorely lacking in Malta. Run by volunteers who are either health or social professionals, it will also include persons who are already part of pro-choice organisations with experience in the area. Womens Rights Foundation WRF chairperson Andrea Dibben said that back in 2018 when WRF had launched its position paper on sexual and reproductive health and rights, it had commented on the lack of community-based family planning and sexual health services and made recommendations to the State to implement such measures. Since then, Doctors for Choice and Womens Rights Foundation as well as the administrators of the social media group Women for Women on Facebook, have consistently received messages and calls from people asking for information and support on contraception, abortion access, and other reproductive health issues. Since there is a clear need for such a service, it made sense for us to pool our resources and set up FPAS, Dibben said. The FPAS will provide information, advice, and support on anything related to sexual and reproductive health, including contraception, morning-after pills, and on all pregnancy options including abortion without fear of being judged or worse, reported, Dibben said. We are working hand in hand with the UK charity Abortion Support Network ASN, and referring clients to ASN if financial support is needed to access abortion abroad. We are also collaborating with a network of local pro-choice professionals including gynaecologists, family doctors, clinical and counselling psychologists, and psychotherapists who we can refer callers to as needed. The service also provides help to access contraception for those with financial difficulties and hopes to expand in the future, depending on the needs identified by women. Our helpline is free of charge and we have volunteers who speak multiple languages. We thought that we would not get any requests for the first few weeks until we kick off with advertising campaigns and media coverage however, in the first two days we have already had a good number of people use the service, Dibben said. The service has already received several messages of support and several requests from people to volunteer. The general feedback we got from the public was that such a service was much needed in Malta. Misinformation and intimidation On his part, Barbara said that misinformation against abortion services and related reproductive health choices is also rife. Unfortunately, it is not an exaggeration to say that women in Malta who need unbiased and reliable information on reproductive healthcare face a dire situation, Barbara said, adding that often people seeking an abortion cannot speak to their family or to their regular doctor out of fear that they may be snubbed. And when they try to search for information online they are tricked by anti-choice groups that pretend to give advice but actually dish out misinformation to suit their anti-abortion and anti-contraception agenda. This is not right, and women in Malta deserve better than this. Likewise, Dibben said that women in these dire situations, need advice and support on sexual and reproductive health issues in order to make a properly informed decision. We just wanted to give women the option to have a pro-choice advisory service. Our response to groups who spread misinformation about us is to be consistent in providing a quality service based on the latest scientific and medical evidence with kindness and compassion, she said. Barbara said the FPAS service was created to be a catalyst for change. We wanted to give women a truly unbiased and compassionate pro-choice advisory service that will support them in whatever decision they make. Word travels fast in Malta and we know that FPAS will have an impact, not just by directly helping women, but also by eliminating the stigma that surrounds abortion and contraception once and for all, he said.

This situation worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, which restricted access to abortion services and other reproductive healthcare options, while also leading to a rise in domestic abuse cases. To address this, a new initiative, the Family Planning Advisory Service (FPAS), was launched by pro-choice doctors and organizations, including the Doctors for Choice and the Women’s Rights Foundation (WRF).

The FPAS is a volunteer-run service providing unbiased, medically accurate advice on various reproductive health topics, such as contraception, abortion, and morning-after pills. It aims to counter the misinformation spread by anti-choice groups, offering women a safe space to seek guidance without fear of judgment. The service also partners with the UK charity Abortion Support Network to assist women needing financial support for abortion services abroad.

In response to the clear demand for such services, the FPAS has been well-received, with numerous inquiries within its first days of operation. Volunteers, including health professionals and social workers, offer assistance in multiple languages and are working to expand the service to better meet the needs of women in Malta. The initiative seeks to eliminate stigma surrounding abortion and contraception, while empowering women to make informed decisions about their reproductive health."
Can Catholics support ‚ÄòBlack Lives Matter‚Äô? | Catholic News Agency,"Can Catholics support Black Lives Matter?

Protesters march during a ""Black Trans Lives Matter"" march against police brutality on June 17, 2020 in the Brooklyn Borough of New York City. Angela Weiss AFP via Getty Images CNA Staff, Jun 17, 2020 1629 pm Catholic leaders say the Church has an important role in working for racial justice, but that protesting for justice does not imply endorsement of the positions taken by Black Lives Matter organizations. The phrase ""BlackLivesMatter"" began to trend online following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a movement grew amid protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 after the shooting of a young black man, Michael Brown, by a police officer. ""Black Lives Matter"" has become the rallying cry for a broad social movement. But there are also specific organizations which take the name ""Black Lives Matter."" The largest and best-funded of those groups is the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, which has a network of local chapters around the U.S. and in other countries, and operates the website blacklivesmatter.com. The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation promotes LGBT ideology and opposes the nuclear family. The group's platform aims to ""dismantle cisgender privilege,"" and ""disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure."" ""We foster a queeraffirming network. When we gather, we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking,"" the group's website says. At least one Black Lives Matter network affiliate has incorporated spiritual rituals into protests, drawing from animistic religions by calling forth deceased ancestors and pouring out libations for them. The leaders of Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles say their efforts are more than a movement for racial justice, but are a ""spiritual movement."" Other organizations also use the phrase ""Black Lives Matter,"" some with different agendas and goals than the global network. But the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation is often correlated directly with the movement itself, and its affiliates often organize local protests. The organization should be distinguished from the broader social movement for racial justice, said Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers, a black Catholic deacon of the Diocese of Portland, Oregon, author, and co-host of EWTN's Morning Glory radio show. ""Marching to protest the inequitable treatment of black people by those in authority-that's good,"" the deacon said. However, the policies espoused by the Black Lives Matter organization on family and sexuality constitute ""a radical feminist agenda disguised as a movement for 'Black Lives Matter,'"" he said. ""No Catholic can support the national organization, whatsoever,"" he added. Burke-Sivers encouraged Catholics to act for racial justice, but to pray first. ""Take the life that God has given us in these sacraments, and become the heads and the hands and the face and the heart of Jesus in the world,"" he said. ""Start with that and then put that into action."" Saying ""Black Lives Matter"" is important, EWTN radio host Gloria Purvis, who is African-American, told CNA. She added that neither the phrase nor the movement should be viewed through the lens of only one organization. ""It's a mistake to say that Black Lives Matter-the organization-is the head of this movement."" ""That's like saying that one organization is the head of the pro-life movement,"" she explained. The phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" represents a whole ""movement for racial justice,"" she said, one which is now global and without one single leader. Using the phrase ""doesn't mean you are now de facto a member of this organization,"" she said. ""For me, as a Catholic, a devout Catholic, as a loyal daughter of the Church, I have no problem saying 'Black Lives Matter,'"" she said. More in US Priest sues Indiana diocese after no evidence found in sex abuse investigation Read article ""I know it doesn't make me a member of the organization."" Some Catholics hesitate to attend protests or other events because they say that not only ""black lives matter,"" but that ""all lives matter,"" she noted. Purvis explained that the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" is not meant to devalue the lives of others, and while all lives do matter, she has observed that ""in practice"" in the U.S., ""what we've seen is that black lives don't."" As a pro-life Catholic, Purvis said she recognizes the eugenist roots of abortion, but said fighting racism in America shouldn't be limited to opposing abortion. She said racism is manifested through police misconduct, housing policies, and other aspects of American public life. Ryan Bomberger, a black pro-life activist and co-founder of the Radiance Foundation, says he does not support the Black Lives Matter movement, because of its hostility to Christianity. ""Every life unjustly killed deserves justice. The question is, how do we pursue that justice? And for me, as a Christian, I cannot embrace a secular movement that is unapologetically hostile to Christianity, in order to pursue justice,"" Bomberger told CNA. While ""a lot of people involved"" with the movement are acting ""out of compassion and love,"" he said, ""the ones leading are very clear about the objectives of the movement,"" Bomberger said. Story continues below Subscribe to our daily newsletter ""It's the entirety of that manifesto that doesn't make any attempt to be Biblical in any sense,"" he said. ""They're not looking for forgiveness or reconciliation, they're looking for political power."" On the relationship of Christians to the Black Lives Matter movement, he said that ""my issue is that the church should be leading, instead of sheepishly following a broken secular movement."" For his part, Bishop Shelton Fabre, chair of the U.S. bishops' committee on racism, told CNA that Catholics should join efforts to call for racial justice. ""Black Lives Matter has a broad agenda covering many social issues, some of which are not in harmony with Catholic teaching. However, on the issue of standing against the injustice of racism, it is my understanding that Catholic Social teaching and Black Lives Matter are in accord,"" the bishop said. ""Because we have a responsibility to bring our faith to the public square, it is appropriate to protest racial injustice,"" he added. In recent weeks, mass protests have occurred in dozens of cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a 46 year-old black man in Minneapolis. Trending In some cities there have also been riots, and a section of Seattle has been declared an ""occupied protest."" A Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while arresting him, Derek Chauvin, was fired by the department and has since been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Two other officers who knelt on Floyd, and one bystanding officer, have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Amid the weeks of protest, both the Black Lives Matter movement and organization have gained increased national attention. Now-retired Bishop Edward Braxton of Belleville, who is African-American, wrote a 2016 pastoral letter on the Catholic Church and the Black Lives Matter movement. In that letter, Braxton said the Black Lives Matter movement doesn't have one leader or organizer. ""The phrase is more a call to action against racial profiling, police brutality, and racial injustice than a specific organization. The media and the public often associate a variety of unconnected groups with Black Lives Matter, when they are actually not structurally connected,"" the bishop noted. However, Braxton noted that most leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement he had encountered reject the Church's teaching on sexuality, marriage and abortion. Others in the movement, he said, are reluctant to work with the Church because they think Catholics have not done enough to fight racism, he wrote. Braxton wrote that there are ""profound differences"" between the teachings of the Church and the Black Lives Matter movement, and that many leaders in that movement do ""not embrace traditional Christian theological ideas about praying to keep the peace and change hearts."" ""They embrace a radical theology of inclusion inspired by a revolutionary Jesus,"" he wrote. The bishop nevertheless encouraged Catholic engagement with leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement. Do differences ""necessarily mean that a representative of the Church cannot have a meaningful conversation with representatives of the movement about these and other issues where there may be greater accord?"" the bishop asked. Braxton wrote that his dialogue with members of the movement had allowed him to present Church teaching on poverty and race, as well as on marriage, sexuality, and human dignity. The bishop said that in dialogue, he ""explained that the Church's social doctrine may be more forceful than they think. I also pointed out that Catholic beliefs about the nature of marriage, the meaning of human sexuality, and the dignity of human life from conception to natural death are not mere cultural norms or social issues. The Church cannot and will not change these moral doctrines. These beliefs represent what the Church firmly holds to be fundamental moral principles rooted in human nature, natural law, biblical revelation and the teachings of Jesus Christ."" Braxton wrote that all Catholics have an obligation to work for racial justice in the framework of Catholic teaching about the dignity of the human person, and the sanctity of human life, and to work, above all, for conversion. ""The Church has a grave responsibility to contribute to the ongoing conversion and spiritual transformation of us all. Working tirelessly day by day, we are co-workers with Christ."" Amid the ongoing protests, Bishop Fabre encouraged Catholics to take seriously the unique role they can play in promoting an end to racism. The present moment, Fabre said, presents an ""extraordinary opportunity"" with many Americans taking an active part in protests against racism and police brutality. However, he said, the work still remains to be done ""to dismantle racism."" ""We should be seeking what unique role God might be asking the Catholic Church to play in transforming opportunity into a watershed moment in eradicating racism,"" he said. African-American Catholics have suffered from racism within the Church for ""decades and centuries,"" he said sometimes it has taken the form of ""parishes not welcoming the ministry of a black priest or deacon,"" he said, ""or parishioners not wanting to receive the Eucharist from an African-American extraordinary minister of holy communion."" Black Catholics ""long for the eradication of racism in the Church through encounter, accompaniment, repentance, justice, action, charity, and prayer,"" he said.

Catholic leaders emphasize that while the Church has a vital role in advocating for racial justice, supporting BLM as an organization is not straightforward due to its controversial positions on issues like family and sexuality. The BLM Global Network Foundation, a major organization associated with the movement, promotes LGBTQ+ rights and opposes the nuclear family, positions that contradict Catholic teachings. As such, some Catholics, such as Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers, believe that Catholics cannot support the organization itself.

However, many Catholics agree that the broader social movement for racial justice—embodied by the phrase “Black Lives Matter”—aligns with Catholic values, particularly on issues like racial injustice. Gloria Purvis, a Catholic proponent of racial justice, stresses that using the phrase “Black Lives Matter” does not imply membership in the controversial organization but reflects support for the larger movement. Ryan Bomberger, a pro-life activist, however, does not support the BLM organization due to its secular, anti-Christian stance.

Bishop Shelton Fabre of the U.S. bishops’ committee on racism acknowledges that the BLM movement has a broad agenda, some of which contradict Catholic teachings, but agrees with the movement’s stance against racism. He encourages Catholics to engage in efforts to end racial injustice, in line with Catholic Social Teaching. Retired Bishop Edward Braxton also notes that while there are doctrinal differences between the Church and BLM, Catholics should engage in dialogue to promote racial justice.

Ultimately, Catholic leaders advocate for addressing racial injustice within the framework of Catholic teaching, highlighting the importance of prayer, conversion, and working for racial reconciliation. Bishop Fabre sees the current moment as a significant opportunity for the Church to play a unique role in eradicating racism, both within society and within the Church itself, where African-American Catholics have faced historical discrimination."
"AAP releases updated guidance on male teen sexual, reproductive health | MDedge Pediatrics","AAP releases updated guidance on male teen sexual, reproductive health MDedge Pediatrics Skip to main content Pediatrics ALL Specialities Diseases ConditionsAsthma Diabetes Injuries Musculoskeletal Disorders Obesity Rare Diseases SubspecialtiesAdolescent Medicine Cardiology Dermatology Gastroenterology Infectious Diseases Neurology Endocrinology Hematology Mental Health Oncology Immunology Neonatal Medicine Nephrology Pulmonology Transgender Health COVID-19 Updates From the Journals AAP releases updated guidance on male teen sexual, reproductive health Publish date April 30, 2020 By Jeff Craven FROM PEDIATRICS The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence has updated its guidance on addressing sexual reproductive health in male adolescents. Since the last guidance was published by AAP in 2011, new data have been released that focus on adolescent male sexual behavior, their use of media, sexually transmitted infections STIs, vaccination for human papillomavirus HPV, discussions surrounding consent, and information for LGBT individuals.Of all these recommendations, the most significant changes are to provide more STI screening for higher risk males and vaccinate all males for HPV starting as early as age 9 years old, lead author Laura K. Grubb, MD, director of adolescent medicine at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, said in an interview.AAP recommends pediatricians consider the following when discussing sexuality and reproductive health with adolescent malesDiscuss the topics of sex and sexuality during routine visits and appropriate opportunities, taking the time to screen for sexual activity and identifying who is at higher risk.Ask male adolescent patients about social media use, how often they view pornography, and how they perceive sexually explicit material. If there is a concern that sexually explicit content is having an adverse effect on the patient, pediatricians should counsel patients and their parents on how to safely and sensibly use the Internet and social media.Screen for nonconsensual sexual activity during well visits and other visits, as appropriate. The principles of consent and nonconsent in the context of sexual activity should be discussed.For patients who are sexually active, screen for sexual problems, including any mental health issues and sexual dysfunction, and initiate counseling or pharmacotherapy where warranted.Coach male adolescent patients on broaching discussions about sex and family planning with their partners, including joint decision making on sexual and reproductive health. Contraception and barrier methods should be discussed and encouraged as appropriate.Assess each patient for appropriate STI risk, testing, and treatmentprevention for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.Consider HPV vaccination for children at least 9 years old and start administration starting at 11 years old. Pediatricians should aim for complete HPV vaccination for all male patients, especially for those patients who engage in high-risk behaviors, according to the guidance.Dr. Grubb said she hopes this guidance helps start a conversation between pediatricians and their adolescent male patients. Talk with your male adolescents about puberty, sexuality, and reproductive health! When pediatricians are informed about these issues and take the initiative to discuss these topics with adolescent males, they are uniquely situated to help them navigate this challenging time safely and confidently.I am especially excited about the significant resources this report provides for pediatricians in the supplemental document, Dr. Grubb added. There are so many great resources out there, especially on the Internet, for adolescents, parents, and pediatricians. Dr. Kelly Curran Kelly Curran, MD, adolescent medicine specialist and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, said in an interview that the guidance information on sexting, sextortion, and sexual dysfunction are important updates for pediatricians. Sextortion is defined as the threatened dissemination of explicit, intimate, or embarrassing images of a sexual nature without consent, usually for the purpose of procuring additional images, sexual acts, money, or something else.We have all seen how social media and technology has transformed adolescence, especially with the rise of sexting. We must remember that males are often the victims of sextortion and sexual assault, especially sexual minority youth, and men may not have the support and services to which female victims have access, said Dr. Curran, who was not a member of the committee.Another important area where pediatricians can help educate adolescent males and their parents is the concept of consent during sexual encounters.As we as a society are having more frank discussions around sexual assault and rape, I think it is essential there is a continued dialogue with young people about consent. Pediatricians have an important role to play in the discussion with their patients, especially in regard to paying attention to verbal and nonverbal cues, and recognizing that consent is an ongoing process, instead of a one time thing, said Dr. Curran, who is a member of the Pediatric News editorial advisory board.One area of the new AAP guidance that surprised Dr. Curran was the number of adolescent males reporting sexual dysfunction 4. While its something I ask about periodically in young men, I havent been consistently asking in visits for those who are at risk, she said. This guideline reminds me to screen more frequently, especially as patients may be too embarrassed to ask.Concerning STI screening, Dr. Curran feels guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF dont go far enough, and the AAPs guidance to provide routine STI risk assessment for all patients is more appropriate.We know that STIs are on the rise and adolescents experience high rates of STI, yet there are only routine screening guidelines for adolescent and young adult women and at-risk populations or in areas of higher prevalence, she said. In my experience, all sexually active adolescents are at risk. I think there should be universal screening of all sexually active adolescents and young adults.The paper had no funding source, and the authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest. Dr. Curran also reported no relevant conflicts of interest.SOURCE Grubb L et al. Pediatrics. 2020 Apr 271455e20200627.

Key changes include:
	1.	STI Screening and HPV Vaccination: The AAP now recommends more frequent STI screenings for high-risk males and universal HPV vaccination for all males, starting as early as age 9. This update emphasizes the importance of early prevention, especially for adolescents engaging in high-risk behaviors.
	2.	Sexuality Discussions: Pediatricians are encouraged to routinely discuss sexuality, consent, and reproductive health during well visits, screening for sexual activity, and assessing risks. These discussions should also address topics like the impact of social media, pornography, and consent.
	3.	Consent and Sexual Health: The AAP highlights the importance of teaching adolescents about consent—emphasizing that it is an ongoing process—and addressing potential issues like sexual assault and sextortion, particularly among sexual minority youth. Pediatricians should also screen for sexual dysfunction and mental health concerns in sexually active teens.
	4.	Sexting and Sextortion: With the rise of digital technology, the AAP stresses the importance of educating adolescents about the risks of sexting and sextortion, where explicit images may be used to coerce sexual acts or money. Male adolescents, especially those in sexual minority groups, are at higher risk and may lack support systems available to female victims.
	5.	Counseling and Contraception: Pediatricians are advised to guide adolescents in discussing family planning and contraception with their partners. This includes encouraging the use of contraception and barrier methods as part of responsible sexual health practices.

The updated guidance underscores the pediatrician’s role in guiding adolescents through this critical developmental period, promoting safe, informed decisions regarding their sexual and reproductive health. Dr. Laura K.

Photograph Suzanne CordeiroAFPGetty ImagesAbortion This article is more than 7 months oldTexas judge rules abortion ban too strict for risky pregnanciesThis article is more than 7 months oldState attorney general immediately appeals against ruling that says doctors must be allowed to end unsafe pregnanciesAssociated Press in AustinSat 5 Aug 2023 09.49 BSTLast modified on Sat 5 Aug 2023 10.58 BSTShareA judge in Texas has ruled that the states abortion ban is too restrictive for women with serious pregnancy complications and must allow exceptions without doctors fearing the threat of criminal charges.The ruling in Austin was the first to undercut the law since it took effect in 2022 and delivers a major victory to abortion rights supporters, who see the case as a potential blueprint to weaken restrictions elsewhere that Republican-led states have rushed to implement.However, the injunction was immediately blocked by an appeal to the Texas supreme court, the state attorney generals office said.The trial courts injunction is ineffective, and the status quo remains in effect, the spokesperson Paige Willey said.The ruling by the state district judge Jessica Mangrum granted a temporary injunction to prevent Texas from enforcing the ban against physicians who in their good faith judgment ended a pregnancy that, because of complications, created a risk of infection or was otherwise unsafe for the woman to continue.The injunction also applied to women who had a condition exacerbated by pregnancy who could not be effectively treated during their term and cases where the foetus had a condition that made it unlikely to survive after birth.For the first time in a long time, I cried for joy when I heard the news, the lead plaintiff, Amanda Zurawski, said. This is exactly why we did this. This is why we put ourselves through the pain and the trauma over and over again to share our experiences and the harms caused by these awful laws.Texas women give harrowing testimony on impact of extreme abortion banRead moreMangrums decision said the injunction would run until the completion of the case, which is scheduled for a trial to begin next March.However, the first assistant attorney general Brent Webster said in a statement that the states appeal stays an activist Austin judges attempt to override Texas abortion laws pending a ruling by the Texas supreme court.The immediate impact of Mangrums decision was unclear in a state where all abortion clinics have shut in the past year.The challenge to the state law is believed to be the first in the US brought by women who have been denied abortions since the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v Wade, which for nearly 50 years had affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion.In a six-page ruling, the judge found that portions of the abortion law violated the rights afforded to pregnant people under the Texas Constitution.The court found that the patients who were challenging the law each experienced emergent medical conditions during pregnancy that risked their health or lives and required abortion care.However, they were delayed or denied access to such care because of widespread uncertainty about the impact on physicians, the ruling said.Todays ruling should prevent other Texans from suffering the unthinkable trauma our plaintiffs endured, said Nancy Northup, the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which helped bring the lawsuit.During two days of emotional testimony in an Austin courtroom, women gave accounts of learning their babies would not survive birth and being unable to travel long distances to states where abortion was still legal.The challenge, filed in March, does not seek to repeal Texass abortion ban, but aims to force more clarity on when exceptions are allowed under the law, which is one of the most restrictive in the US.In Texas, doctors who perform abortions risk life in prison and fines of up to 100,000. Opponents say that has left some women with providers who are unwilling to even discuss terminating a pregnancy.The majority of US adults, including those living in states with the strictest limits on abortion, want it to be legal at least through the initial stages of pregnancy, according to a poll released in late June by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Explore more on these topicsAbortionTexasWomennewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUS appeals court upholds restrictions on abortion pill access16 Aug 2023Girl, 13, gives birth after she was raped and denied abortion in Mississippi14 Aug 2023Texas questions rights of fetus in prison guard lawsuit despite arguing opposite on abortion12 Aug 2023Ohio saw through the con abortion rights advocates celebrate Issue 1 result9 Aug 2023Republicans pushed a special election in Ohio what does it mean for abortion rights?8 Aug 2023Judge blocks Idaho from prosecuting doctors who refer patients out of state for abortions1 Aug 2023Republicans target abortion pill access as government shutdown threat looms25 Jul 2023They railroad them the states using fetal personhood laws to criminalize mothers25 Jul 2023Group using shield laws to provide abortion care in states that ban it23 Jul 2023Why Maryland became a haven for abortion care after Roes fall22 Jul 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The decision, made on August 5, 2023, granted a temporary injunction allowing doctors to perform abortions in cases where continuing the pregnancy would risk the woman’s health, including situations of infection or fatal fetal conditions. This ruling marked a significant challenge to Texas’ 2022 abortion law, which had imposed criminal penalties on doctors for performing abortions, with the risk of prison sentences and hefty fines.

The case was brought by Amanda Zurawski and other women who experienced medical complications, but were denied timely access to abortions due to the uncertainty around the law. The judge’s ruling, which temporarily blocked the enforcement of the ban on such procedures, was seen as a win for abortion rights supporters and could influence future legal challenges in other restrictive states.

The Texas Attorney General’s office quickly appealed the decision, and the Texas Supreme Court temporarily halted the injunction, meaning the state’s abortion restrictions remained in effect. The case, expected to go to trial in March 2024, does not seek to overturn the state’s abortion ban but instead aims to clarify the law’s exceptions. Abortion rights advocates hope this case could set a precedent for challenging extreme abortion bans across the U.S.

The legal challenge highlights the dire consequences women have faced under the state’s abortion law, with many unable to travel to other states for abortions due to logistical or financial barriers."

Michele Goodwin, sheherhers, Chancellor's Professor of Law, University of California, Irvine Share This Page July 1, 2020 In 1851, Sojourner Truth delivered a speech best known asAint I A Woman? to a crowded audience at the Womens Convention in Akron, Ohio. At the time, slavery remained in full force, a vibrant enterprise that fueled the American economy. Various laws protected that system, including the Fugitive Slave Act, which resulted in the abduction of free Black children, women, and men as well as those who had miraculously escaped to northern cities like Boston or Philadelphia. Bounty hunters then sold their prey to Southern plantation owners. The law denied basic protections for Black people caught in the greed-filled grasps of slavery. Ms. Truth condemned this disgraceful enterprise, which thrived off not only uncompensated labor, but also physical and psychological terror. Most will remember Ms. Truths oration for its vivid descriptions regarding physical labor Black women were forced to plough, plant, herd, and build just as men. Yet far too little attention centers on her condemnation of that system, which made sexual chattel of Black women, and then cruelly sold off Black children. This was human trafficking in the American form, and it lasted for centuries. Ms. Truth pleaded I have borne 13 children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mothers grief, none but Jesus heard me! And aint I a woman? Following the Supreme Courts decision in June Medical Services v. Russo this week, it is worth reflecting on the racist origins of the anti-abortion movement in the United States, which date back to the ideologies of slavery. Just like slavery, anti-abortion efforts are rooted in white supremacy, the exploitation of Black women, and placing womens bodies in service to men. Just like slavery, maximizing wealth and consolidating power motivated the anti-abortion enterprise. Then, just as now, anti-abortion efforts have nothing to do with saving womens lives or protecting the interests of children. Today, a person is 14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion, and medical evidence has shown for decades that an abortion is as safe as a penicillin shotand yet abortion remains heavily restricted in states across the country. Prior to the Civil War, abortion and contraceptives were legal in the U.S., used by Indigenous women as well as those who sailed to these lands from Europe. For the most part, the persons who performed all manner of reproductive health care were women female midwives. Midwifery was interracial half of the women who provided reproductive health care were Black women. Other midwives were Indigenous and white. However, in the wake of slaverys end, skilled Black midwives represented both real competition for white men who sought to enter the practice of child delivery, and a threat to how obstetricians viewed themselves. Male gynecologists claimed midwifery was a degrading means of obstetrical care. They viewed themselves as elite members of a trained profession with tools such as forceps and other technologies, and the modern convenience of hospitals, which excluded Black and Indigenous women from practice within their institutions. History would later reveal that it was literally on the backs of Black womens bodies that such tools were developed. Dr. Marion Sims famously wrote about his insomniac-induced epiphanies that stirred him to experiment on enslaved Black women, lacerating, suturing, and cutting, providing no anesthesia or pain relief. Only recently have the terrors that Black women endured through nonconsensual experimentation by gynecologists of the 19th and 20th centuries been acknowledged. Successful racist and misogynistic smear campaigns, cleverly designed for political persuasion and to achieve legal reform, described Black midwives as unhygienic, barbarous, ineffective, non-scientific, dangerous, and unprofessional. Dr. Joseph DeLee, a preeminent 20th century obstetrician and fervent opponent to midwifery, stated in a much-quoted 1915 speech, Progress Toward Ideal Obstetrics The midwife is a relic of barbarism. In civilized countries the midwife is wrong, has always been wrong The midwife has been a drag on the progress of the science and art of obstetrics. Her existence stunts the one and degrades the other. For many centuries she perverted obstetrics from obtaining any standing at all among the science of medicine Even after midwifery was practiced by some of the most brilliant men in the profession, such practice was held opprobrious and degraded. At the root of these stereotypes were explicit efforts to destroy midwifery and promote white supremacy. As the surge of lynchings, separate but equal laws, police violence, and the decimation of successful Black communities during Jim Crow revealed, Black Americans post slavery suffered greatly due to white supremacy, as did Chinese and Japanese workers and their families. Indeed, the racist campaigns launched by doctors against Black midwives extended to anti-immigration legislative platforms targeted at Chinese and Japanese workers. The Page Act, which restricted Chinese women from entering the United States, is a part of this shameful legacy. This broader 20th century anti-Chinese campaign became known as yellow peril. DeLee and Horatio Storer urged white women to spread their loins across the nation, a dog whistle about the threat of too many Blacks and Asians in the U.S. Gynecologists explicitly revealed their motivations in undermining midwifery They desired financial gains, recognition, and a monopoly. As Dr. DeLee wrote in a 1916 article published in the American Journal of Obstetrics Disease of Women Children, There is high art in obstetrics and that it must pay as well for it as for surgery. I will not admit that this is a sordid impulse. It is only common justice to labor, self-sacrifice, and skill. They believed that men should be paid, but not women particularly not Black women. To better understand racial injustice in the anti-abortion movement, remember that American hospitals barred the admission of African Americans both in terms of practice and as patients. And, the American Medical Association AMA barred women and Black people from membership. The AMA, founded in 1847, refused to admit Black doctors, informing them, You come from groups and schools that admit women and that admit irregular practitioners. For this reason, Black doctors formed the National Medical Association in 1895. In 2008, the organization issued a public apology for its active campaigns to close Black medical schools, deny Blacks membership, and other efforts to marginalize Black patients and practitioners. Gynecologists pushed women out of the field of reproductive health by lobbying state legislatures to ban midwifery and prohibit abortions. Doing so not only undercut womens reproductive health, but also drove qualified Black women out of medical services. For these groups, there was no meaningful path to the formalized skill set DeLee claimed necessary. Abortion was an expedient way to frame their campaign to create monopolies on womens bodies for male doctors. The American Medical Association explicitly contributed to this cause through its exclusion of women and Black people. Today, as people debate whether anti-abortion platforms benefit Black women, the clear answer is no. The U.S. leads the developed world in maternal and infant mortality. The U.S. ranks around 50th in the world for maternal safety. Nationally, for Black women, the maternal death rate is nearly four times that of white women, and 10 to 17 times worse in some states. In the wake of both Whole Womans Health and June Medical Services v. Russo, keep in mind that both Texas and Louisiana, where these cases originated, are considered the deadliest in the developed world for a woman to give birth. Sadly, pregnancy has become a death sentence for many in the very places that make reproductive health care access the most fraught and hard to reach. Many of these states though not all are former slave states, such as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas. As Black people in these states continue to fight for equal access the reproductive care they need, Sojourner Truths 1851 speech continues to resonate. And as the Supreme Court demonstrated this week, the fight for justice in reproductive health care and equality in abortion access is far from over. The decision does not advance the equality of poor Black women it maintains all other burdensome restrictions already in place. We have much more work to do such that not only DeLees words, but also his racist and exploitative viewpoints, are relegated to history.

Lawrence George Canady III","The article discusses the historical roots of abortion restrictions in the United States, emphasizing the connection to white supremacy and the exploitation of Black women. It links the current anti-abortion movement to ideologies stemming from slavery and racism, focusing on how these movements sought to control and limit Black women’s autonomy.

Key points include:
	1.	Historical Context of Reproductive Health Care: Before the Civil War, abortion and contraception were legal, with women, including Black and Indigenous women, performing reproductive health care. However, after slavery ended, Black midwives became a target of racist campaigns led by white male gynecologists, who sought to monopolize the field.
	2.	Racist Campaigns Against Midwifery: White male obstetricians framed Black midwives as dangerous and unprofessional, aiming to push them out of the field and consolidate their own power. These campaigns were not only racist but also financially motivated, as gynecologists sought financial and professional dominance.
	3.	Medical and Social Exclusion of Black People: The American Medical Association (AMA) excluded Black doctors and women from membership, contributing to the marginalization of Black people in medical practice. These efforts were mirrored in legislation that banned midwifery and abortion, which reduced access to reproductive care for women, particularly Black women.
	4.	Racial Disparities in Maternal Health: Today, the U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world, with Black women facing disproportionately high risks. In states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama—many of which were former slave states—the maternal death rate for Black women is significantly higher than for white women.
	5.	Modern Implications and Ongoing Struggle: Despite progress in reproductive rights, the article argues that the current legal framework still disadvantages Black women, especially in states with restrictive abortion laws. The legacy of racism in medical and legal systems continues to affect access to reproductive health care, and much work remains to ensure equity in abortion access.

In conclusion, the article traces the racist and sexist history of abortion and midwifery bans, demonstrating that these issues are deeply intertwined with the history of slavery and the ongoing struggle for racial and gender justice in the U.S."

Jackson Womens Health Organization and ruled that states are free to restrict or prohibit abortion access. In Texas, a pair of laws together ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest, and with narrow exemptions for pregnant people at risk of death Senate Bill 8 SB 8, signed by Gov. Greg Abbott, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021. This law outlaws abortion around six weeks of gestation, even in cases of rape and incest. SB 8 is currently in effect. House Bill 1280 HB 1280, a so-called Trigger Ban, which creates harsh criminal penalties for providers and doctors for performing or aiding abortions at all stages of pregnancy, without exception for rape or incest, and with narrow exemptions for the life and health of pregnant people. As of August 25, 2022, this trigger has been pulled. Finally, the State of Texas maintains that the criminal laws at issue in Roe v. Wade, long-since held unconstitutional, remain in effect. These laws prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exception. But the law does not support this and we are challenging the States position in court. The ACLU of Texas and partners are challenging the validity of the pre-Roe statutes in the courts. On June 28, 2022, a judge in Harris County sided with abortion providers and issued a temporary restraining order blocking any prosecutions under the pre-Roe statutes. Shortly thereafter, Attorney General Ken Paxton, who does not have the authority to prosecute criminal violations, sought emergency relief from the Texas Supreme Court. The Court granted such relief to Paxton, while maintaining the prohibition against prosecution by district attorneys. We will update this information as the lawsuit moves through the courts. Please check back regularly. This content is intended to serve as general information it is not legal advice nor intended as legal advice. Is abortion legal in Texas? No, not unless an examining physician determines that a pregnant person's life is in danger. It is important to know that Texas homicide, or murder statute cannot be used to prosecute a person for the outcome of their pregnancy. If you are in Texas and need abortion care, visit the following websites for logistical andor financial support How far into pregnancy can I have an abortion? Texas bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, unless you have a life-threatening medical emergency. The law does not provide exceptions for cases that involve rape or incest. Is it illegal for me as a Texan, or anyone helping me, to get an abortion in another state or country? No. First, neither the pre-Roe statutes, the Trigger Ban, nor SB 8, allow prosecutions or lawsuits directly against people who receive abortions. Second, while it is not possible to guarantee that people attempting to enforce these criminal laws or SB 8 will not bring a lawsuit against Texans who refer or provide assistance to patients seeking abortion care out of state, these laws do not apply to out-of-state abortions. Therefore, assisting someone to access out-of-state abortion care would not violate these laws. Can I get an abortion in Texas if Im under 18 years old? If you are under 18, live in Texas, and need to access abortion confidentially, please call or text Jane's Due Process' hotline at 866-999-5263. Is it considered aiding and abetting under Texas law if I donate to a Texas abortion fund? Donating money to a charity is a protected First Amendment activity. While it is not possible to guarantee that people will not attempt to enforce these laws against such constitutionally-protected activities, the risk of liability is very low. However, some abortion funds in Texas might cease operations in light of the Supreme Court ruling. You can also choose to contribute to the National Network of Abortion Funds. What are my options for an abortion procedure outside of Texas? Visit the website ineedana.com to find the clinic nearest to you and get connected with a verified abortion provider. Is abortion covered by my health insurance plan? As of December 1, 2017, Texas law forbids insurers from covering abortion as part of your overall health insurance plan, unless you need an abortion to save you from death or serious physical injury. Military insurance and Medicaid only cover abortion in cases of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions. Is abortion safe? Yes, abortion is an extremely safe and common procedure. Currently, about one in four Americans who can reproduce have had an abortion by the age of 45. Abortions happen without any major complications in more than 99.975 of cases. That means an abortion is about as safe as a colonoscopy. Will having an abortion put me at an increased risk for breast cancer? No. Although Texas requires your doctor to read you a statement suggesting that there is an increased risk of breast cancer after an abortion, its not true. Cancer experts and reproductive health experts agree that there is no such risk. For example, the American Cancer Society concluded that there are no scientific research studies demonstrate a causal relationship between abortion and breast cancer. Will I still be able to get pregnant again if I have an abortion? Yes. Abortion hasnt been shown to cause complications in subsequent pregnancies, and there is no scientific evidence that abortion is linked to infertility. Is it true that Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S.? Yes. Texas abortion laws are some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose some of Texas abortion laws because excessive restrictions on abortion care jeopardize patients' health. As a result of these laws, there are not enough abortion clinics to serve people in Texas, the nations second-most-populous state. About 900,000 people who are able to reproduce in Texas live more than 150 miles from the nearest abortion clinic. Werent these laws struck down by the Supreme Court? Several times. Not only Roe v. Wade, but several Supreme Court opinions since have rejected Texass criminal abortion laws and regulatory enactments. The Supreme Courts about-face in 2022 undermines this well-established precedent, and leaves Texas free to prohibit and regulate abortion with limited federal oversight.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization (June 2022). This ruling overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to regulate abortion access, which Texas took full advantage of through two laws:
	1.	Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), enacted in September 2021, bans abortion around six weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest, only allowing abortions when a pregnant person’s life is at risk.
	2.	House Bill 1280 (HB 1280), a “trigger ban,” imposes criminal penalties on those performing abortions at any stage of pregnancy, except when the pregnant person’s life is in danger.

Both laws significantly restrict abortion access in Texas, and the ACLU is challenging the state’s interpretation of pre-Roe statutes that were previously deemed unconstitutional.

Regarding the legality of abortion:
	•	Abortion is illegal in Texas except when a life-threatening medical emergency occurs.
	•	There are no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest.
	•	Texans seeking abortion care outside of the state are not subject to prosecution under state law.
	•	Under-18s seeking abortions in Texas can access confidential support through Jane’s Due Process.

Other considerations:
	•	Health insurance in Texas does not cover abortions unless the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the individual, with limited exceptions for military insurance and Medicaid.
	•	The safety of abortion is emphasized, with over 99.975% of procedures being complication-free, and no evidence linking abortion to breast cancer or infertility.
	•	Texas has some of the strictest abortion laws in the U.S., with many people in the state facing significant barriers to accessing care due to the limited number of clinics.

The ACLU also provides resources for financial and logistical support, as well as options for obtaining abortions outside Texas."

Share full article The pro-life movement has been fighting to overturn Roe v. Wade for decades. So it was striking that in the wake of Roes demise, the pro-life Americans who participated in one of our latest focus groups expressed a range of emotions about last months decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization. Complicated and debatable were a few of the words participants used to describe the decision, with several calling it challenging and expressing surprise that it happened. One participant said, Its important that the government is in sync with the public opinion, but I dont think they are. Some of the participants, who spoke with us last week from around the country, said that despite identifying as pro-life, they believed that women should be able to make the choice about whether to have an abortion. Its their bodies, said one man. Many from the group said that abortion should be available in some circumstances, such as early in pregnancy or when a woman is the victim of rape or incest. Abortion was an obviously emotional issue for the group, with several participants expressing a desire for women who get pregnant unexpectedly to take responsibility for their actions. A number were clearly moved by the claims of anti-abortion lawmakers who have worked to ban abortion after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, starting around six weeks of pregnancy. Most medical experts say there is no real heartbeat at six weeks, and many women do not know theyre pregnant at that stage. But those claims have a clear emotional pull, as expressed by the group They believe that even very early pregnancies are babies, with rights of their own. As with the pro-choice focus group we conducted on the same evening, many of the pro-life participants thought abortion to be much more dangerous than it is. Fewer than a quarter of 1 percent of abortions result in serious complications, and childbirth is 14 times as likely to result in death as an early abortion. But it was the emotional weight of this moment in American history that the participants came back to again and again in our conversation. As one participant said, I feel like the good days are long gone. Raising my 2-year-old in this world terrifies me. In both focus groups, participants used the phrases pro-life and pro-choice to describe themselves as well as others, and to describe viewpoints these edited versions retain that language to reflect how the participants spoke about these issues.

Vincent, The economy. Anthony, Education. Marcia, Economy as well. Lola, Economy. I would say security. Crime. Eileen, Christina, Richard, Lifestyle Gwendolyn, Sue, So thinking a little bit more broadly Do you think Americas best days are ahead of us, behind us or happening now? Theyre happening now, but very slowly. I want to be optimistic and say theyre ahead of us. I feel like the good days are long gone. Raising my 2-year-old in this world terrifies me. Its unsafe, and nobody can afford to live. Its not the world that I grew up in. Definitely behind us. People dont care for one another enough nowadays. All this random killing. People have changed a lot. And I think its for the worse. Tonight, were going to be talking about something thats been in the news recently, and thats abortion. In your view, whats the debate around abortion about? Roe v. Wade. When it comes down to abortion, I believe women should have the right. Its their bodies. I think that If youre going to have an abortion, it should be done before six weeks. Im more pro-life, unless its through something you cant control, like incest or rape. I think sex is made for people that are responsible. And if youre responsible, then you should know the outcomes and face the consequences of what could happen. How would you describe your position on abortion? I feel like the choice should be left up to women. It does take a toll on them, financially, physically, emotionally. So its their choice. But I just dont believe in taking a life. Im pro-life. But educate, educate, educate. Im a mother of three, and I wanted an abortion at some point. But from my own research, at four weeks, theres a heartbeat. I couldnt do it. Who is going to speak up for that baby at five weeks, six weeks, seven weeks ? Youre killing someone. In the case of incest or rape, youre going to find out youre pregnant before you get that baby to three weeks, four weeks. You can dissolve that clot of blood. But after four weeks, theres a heartbeat, so I dont think that women should have that right. Wheres the right for the kid? Sue, tell me more about your position on abortion. After a certain period of time, people make conscious choices, and there are consequences to those choices. It shouldnt be taken out on the fetus. Within the first six weeks, those kinds of decisions can be made. But after that, theyre a baby, and they deserve to be protected, too. Four weeks. Not six weeks. I get your four weeks, but I think a lot of people dont pay attention till after their menstrual cycle, and sometimes it takes them a little bit. What about this debate is important to you? The baby. I think very, very early term abortion should be a womans choice. Things do happen. No form of birth control is 100 percent. My son is proof of that. But I dont agree with abortion after more than four to six weeks or so. OK, Richard, what about this debate is important to you? Life is too beautiful and should not be wasted, by any means necessary. Every human being deserves a right to be born. And once theyre already on that process, they should go with it. I dealt with infertility for years. I knew a girl that had nine abortions by the time she was 25 because she used it as birth control. With my son, when we went at six weeks and three days, there was no heartbeat. But when we went back a few days later, there was one. So its not going to be the same time frame for every single person. And Destinee, what about this debate is important to you? Everyone is going through different things. But across the board, there are tons of families that are willing to adopt. And that is why I am so pro-life. Even though it might not be the best situation for you or your life at that point, there is someone who would love to love that baby, and thats how I see it. And people believe that abortion should be fine up to 16 weeks. I could feel my baby move at 14 weeks, and she reacted to my touch by 16 weeks. So that just is mind-blowing to me. If you were describing someone who feels differently than you on this issue, how would you characterize them? Its a complicated topic. Its an emotional topic. I dont think badly of them. But I get concerned that maybe they dont understand the full impact of the consequences of the decision that theyre saying should be allowed to be made. And Eileen, how would you characterize someone who feels differently than you on this issue? I assume that they are probably Democratic and Not necessarily. But I try not to judge people based on their opinions about things like this. OK, Christina, how would you characterize someone who feels differently than you on this issue? I might still be friends with them. But every time Id see them, Id think, Oh, theyre baby killers. What percentage of abortions happen after the first trimester? Im going to say its a high percentage. I would say a very low percentage, probably no more than 5 percent. If youre still pregnant when youre 12-plus weeks, you probably want that child. I would say probably 95 percent or more happen in the first, probably, six to 10 weeks. Based on what I have observed over time, I believe that number is a little bit higher than what is deemed moral in my perception. What percent of the time do you think women face serious complications after an abortion in the first trimester? Im going to guess 10 percent, a small percentage. I think about 20 percent, not very high. About 15 percent. Which tends to be more physicallydangerous to the woman an abortion orchildbirth? How many say abortion? Which tends to be morephysically dangerous to thewoman an abortion or childbirth? How many say abortion? 6 people raised their hands.2 out of 10 people raised their handsin the pro-choice focus group. Olivia, 27, Oklahoma, white, leans Republican Destinee, 30, Pennsylvania, white, leans Republican Eileen, 29, Missouri, white, leans Republican Marcia, 57, Georgia, Black, independent Anthony, 33, Georgia, Black, independent Lola, 41, Arizona, white, Republican Vincent, 51, Georgia, Black, independent Dwyarrn, 55, New York, Black, leans Democratic Christina, 40, Pennsylvania, white, Democrat Richard, 30, New York, Hispanic, leans Republican Sue, 60, Illinois, white, leans Republican Gwendolyn, 55, Florida, Black, Democrat I feel like thats an invasive procedure and its stopping a life from fully developing. There might be other complications that arise the next time the woman wants to have a child. You may end up damaging an organ or something. Well, both are very traumatic on our bodies. I believe childbirth can be a little bit more detrimental to a woman because I do know of two women who actually died after childbirth. I think abortions a little more dangerous. Once the child gets to a certain stage in gestation and you start snatching stuff thats connected to your body, I think theres a possibility you could have long-term effects. What have you heard about abortion medications? As far as you know, is it legal? And what percentage of abortions do you think are done this way? Not enough testing has been done to say that its safe. And that its just a way for people not to be responsible adults. I dont really know much about the abortion medication. I would say half of them are probably done with this abortion medication. I felt like a lower percentage are done that way. Who feels like a higher percentage is done this way? Because its like a one-pill-and-done thing, they dont have to take the responsibility of remembering to take a pill every day. So theyre like, Oh, well, Ill just go have unprotected sex, and Ill just get the pill and take it tomorrow, and itll be done and over with. What do you feel that most elected Democratic officials believe on abortion? What do they want abortion policy to look like in this country? I always get the impression that the Democrats are very liberal about it and feel like everythings fine. Just let everything happen. And we shouldnt stop anybody from getting abortions. OK, and how about Republican elected officials? Richard, what do Republican elected officials want abortion policy to look like in this country? Well, I live in Oklahoma, a very Republican state, and our governor is very pro-life. He said that he will sign any pro-life legislation that goes to his desk. Oklahoma is very, very pro-life. Democrats, on the other hand it doesnt make sense. Democrats want women to have freedom over their bodies and say they should be able to make that choice. But yet they want mandated vaccines, which wouldnt give you control of your body. The Supreme Court recently overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to have an abortion in 1973. Now its up to the states to decide their own laws. Whats the first word that comes up for you when you think about this ruling? Fair. Pray. Challenging. I would also have to agree challenging. Yeah, challenging, I would say. Complicated. Great. Wonderful. Unpredictable. I agree with challenging. Glad. Frustrating. Debatable. Moderator, Vanessa Mobley Were you surprised by the decision to overturn Roe? I would have been more surprised if the document hadnt been leaked two months ago. But otherwise, yeah, I am surprised. The people who are for abortion are a lot more vocal than the people who arent. I would have been, like she said, had it not been leaked ahead of time, because a lot of pro-life people dont speak out because there is such negative opinions of people like us, so we keep our opinions to ourselves. Can I ask you what about the reaction to the decision? I expected the reaction to be stronger than it was. I thought there was going to be more rioting. I thought there would be a lot more violence. I was honestly really surprised. And happy that it wasnt that way and that people were just peacefully protesting. Whats the impact of this ruling on your families, personally? And how about the impact on women overall? Well, it really doesnt affect me personally. Well, I shouldnt say that. I do have a young daughter. She and I did talk about it, and she asked me what was my stance on it. And I did tell her I was more pro-life than pro-choice. And she, being 13 shes, I guess, leaning more pro-choice. And what about the impact on women overall? Are you asking me that question? Yes. Well, its like this. I respect peoples choices and decisions. Even though Im mostly pro-life, I do feel like there should be some allowances for abortions, such as rape or if a womans life was in jeopardy her or the child that type of situation. But I just feel like we just have to accept that its been overturned and its going to be for the life. In my household, I have two girls. If you get pregnant by being irresponsible, maybe you should have the baby and give it up for adoption. Now I think the women are going to lose their minds. Some think, hey, abortion gives them an excuse to be more irresponsible sometimes. Mm-hmm. Its all about morals and ethics, morals and ethics, because you know what? At the end of the day, youre going to be accountable for it. What one word best describes how you feel about the Supreme Court? Controlling. Courageous. Yeah, Im going to go with Sue courageous. It does take courage to make decisions. Courageous. Disappointed. I agree with Vincent disappointed. I would say difficult. Challenging, probably. Yeah, challenging. Brave. Eileen, you said difficult. Can you tell me more about that? I think that they are just in a difficult position. Gwendolyn, you said disappointed. Man is in control of the earth. Im just going to stick to my religion and what I believe in. I wouldnt want the blood on my hands. So I wouldnt dare to make decisions. How would you describe the overall direction of the Supreme Court right now? I think theyre making the right decision because theyre letting issues be put in each states hands. Were the United States. Olivia, if you had to say, do you feel like they are moving in too much of a conservative direction, too liberal or middle of the road? I think it really depends on each issue. But this ruling was definitely a conservative ruling. More toward conservative. But I will say this marijuana is legal over there, but its not legal here. Decisions are being made from higher up, but then you go state to state, and people can do what they want to do. Destinee, just based on what you know, how in sync do you think the Supreme Court is with public opinion on abortion? Not very in sync at all, because I think a lot of people are pro-choice. I feel like the Supreme Court is going more conservative, and I think that the United States as a whole is more liberal. I dont think they made their decision based on public opinion. They tried to make it based on the letter of the law. Thats really what their job is supposed to be. How much does it matter if the court is in sync with public opinion? I think they should definitely put into consideration the people that theyre actually making the law for. So I think the people are what youre hired for, anyway. Exactly. I agree. Its important that the government is in sync with the public opinion, but I dont think they are. If youre going to make drastic changes like that, you need to have more public opinion involved before you make those decisions. I would just say that the Supreme Court needs to follow the law. Thats what they were trained to do. But if the laws are doing things that would harm people or otherwise enforce corruption or damage the country as a whole, then maybe its time to rewrite the laws and look at it differently. Do you think the Supreme Court maynow re-examine other decisions, like theones allowing gay marriage, birth control,sexual intimacy or interracial marriage? Do you think the SupremeCourt may now re-examine otherdecisions, like the ones allowinggay marriage, birth control, sexualintimacy or interracial marriage? 7 people raised their hands.9 out of 10 people raised their handsin the pro-choice focus group. Its constantly going to be like, Well, why is that law OK and this ones not? The current Supreme Court ruling returns abortion laws to the states. As far as you know, whats happening in your state? What are the current laws on abortion? I live in Pennsylvania, so nothing changed for us. Youre still allowed to get an abortion, I think, up to 16 weeks here. Im in Missouri, and with the trigger law, it immediately made abortions illegal. What would you like to see your states elected officials do on abortion? I would just like them to make it so that its only permissible for a woman who may have been raped or incest or real early term. There are only two reasons for abortion if youre raped or if it was incest. But it needs to be within the first two weeks. Is it reasonable to ban abortions at a certain point in pregnancy? I think that as soon as they can find a heartbeat with a fetal Doppler, it should indefinitely be banned, unless it is going to affect the mothers life like, shes going to die if she doesnt get an abortion. I just think after the first six weeks, unless its a danger to the life of the mother, it should be banned. . I would go with what Sue said. Yeah, I would agree up to six weeks. And then after that point, its not permissible, unless its a life-or-death situation. I dont think it should be four weeks, five weeks, six weeks, whatever. It needs to be if you hear a heartbeat or not. Whats your reaction to passing a law protecting the right to abortion in your state? I think that abortion should only be OK in the event that theres rape, incest or its medically necessary. Vincent, when I say, Pass a law protecting the right to an abortion in your state, give me your reaction. Im in agreement with it. People have their rights. As far as religious purposes and different things, thats between them and God. When it comes to the law and religion, you have to separate that. When it comes down to morals and emotions, people have their rights, whether you agree or disagree. How about a proposal to make sure abortion laws have an exception for rape or incest? I think you should be able to have an abortion if you are raped, but you cant just show up to a clinic and say, I was raped. I think you need to have hospital documentation proving that you were, because otherwise, anybody could say they were raped just to get an abortion. You need to report to the police. You need to go to the hospital, have them do an exam, because now that this is illegal in some states, everybodys going to be saying that they were raped. Make sure abortion laws have exceptions for the health of the woman whats your reaction to that? I think you have to have exceptions because sometimes its not till just before the birth that they know that there has to be a decision between the life of the mother and the life of the baby. I agree, and not just physically. Theres also mental health. Well, I just want to clarify physical health of the mother, not mental health, not other things. Theres too much room for making up reasons. It has to be related to the physical health. That actually brings me to my next question What do you think about making sure that abortion laws have exceptions for the health of the woman, including if the woman is suicidal? She needs mental help sooner than an abortion. I dont think jumping to getting an abortion is the answer. What about cases of ectopic pregnancy, which implants outside the uterus and is never viable but can be dangerous? Should there be exceptions there? What about a woman who has cancer and needs an abortion to get a lifesaving treatment? Should there be exceptions for the health of the woman? If its for a lifesaving treatment, the law definitely needs to have that space for consideration. Yes, definitely. You can always have more kids. How about allowing abortions in cases of fetal abnormalities? It would depend on what the abnormality is. Missing an arm, a leg thats an abnormality that I dont think should be allowed. But if they dont have a brain or organs that arent functioning or something, then I think thats OK. Should abortion be criminalized, potentially imprisoning abortion doctors or abortion patients? No, I dont think they should. I dont think jail time should be one of the things that they face. Should somebody be prevented from crossing state lines to get an abortion in another state? I think you should have to prove that youre a citizen of that state to get an abortion. Should the law prevent someone from having an abortion because of the preference for a baby of a certain gender? Well, its just like in China Oh, we wanted a boy, so we birthed our baby girls, and we left them in a crying room to die. Thats not OK. How would you feel if the federal government passed legislation to make abortion illegal in every state, and how likely is it that that will happen? I think I would need more details of what that actually means, but I dont think its very likely. How would you feel if the federal government passed legislation to protect the right to abortion in every state? I think that it should be illegal across the entire country unless youre raped, a victim of incest or the mother is going to die. If its state by state, unless they make it illegal to cross state lines, I think the issue theyre going to run into is, Hey, you can come stay with me and get an abortion in my state. Ive already seen posts all over Facebook where people are offering to let people come to their house and take care of them and everything while they can get an abortion in their state. How important is the issue of abortion to you personally, in terms of your voting? I think its very important. If you leave it up to somebody, theyre just going to take advantage of it. And like a couple other people said, theyre just going to use it as a form of birth control if they change it to pro-choice. What do you want to hear Democrats say about abortion? I just feel like I want them to be more reasonable. I know a lot of them on the far left think that you should be able to get an abortion up to the moment you give birth. I would just like them to try to maybe see the other side of everything and realize that this is a viable child. I want Democrats to be more educated about the topic, be more educated about the loss-of-life issue, because its not just your body. And what would you like to hear Republicans say? That theyre pro-life. I would like them to also say that there are exceptions, like very early on, in the case of rape or incest or the mothers life is at risk. If you agreed with a candidate onmost things but disagreed with thatcandidate on abortion, raise your handif you could still vote for that person. If you agreed with a candidateon most things but disagreedwith that candidate on abortion,raise your hand if you couldstill vote for that person. 8 people raised their hands.2 out of 10 people raised their handsin the pro-choice focus group. Roe v. Wade was the law for 50 years. Fifty years from now, what do you think the debate around abortion will be? Itll probably be the same thing the right of a woman, if she has the right to have an abortion, regardless of the reason. And they will probably want to overturn it again so that we will be more pro-choice. Well, I think well have more data. So a lot of people are throwing out numbers right now about back-alley abortions and stuff like that. But I think well just be better educated, so we can have a more scientific discussion about it. Thank you. And Sue, do you think well still be debating this subject 50 years from now? I think theres always going to be people that are going to want to have a discussion about it, because theres always going to be people who are in disagreement.

	1.	Feelings About the Supreme Court: Participants were divided in their feelings toward the Supreme Court. Some viewed the Court as courageous for making tough decisions, while others were disappointed, seeing its direction as increasingly conservative. A common theme was that the Court’s decisions were seen as difficult, especially regarding controversial issues like abortion.
	2.	Impact on Public Opinion: Several participants felt that the Supreme Court’s decisions, particularly on abortion, did not align with public opinion, which they believed leaned more pro-choice. There was also a sentiment that the Court should be more in tune with the public’s views, especially when making drastic changes. However, some believed the Court’s primary role is to interpret the law, not to reflect popular sentiment.
	3.	State vs. Federal Abortion Laws: The group discussed how abortion laws vary across states. Some participants lived in states where abortion was still legal (like Pennsylvania), while others were in states with stricter laws, like Missouri, where abortion was immediately banned due to trigger laws. There was a debate about whether abortion laws should be decided at the state level or federally mandated.
	4.	Abortion Laws and Exceptions: Participants had strong opinions on when abortion should be allowed. Many agreed that abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life was at risk. Some supported allowing abortion within a limited window (such as up to six weeks or when a heartbeat is detected). There was also significant support for making exceptions in cases of fetal abnormalities, ectopic pregnancies, or life-threatening conditions for the mother.
	5.	Criminalization and Cross-State Abortions: Participants were largely against criminalizing abortion or imprisoning doctors or patients involved in abortion procedures. There was also a division over whether people should be allowed to cross state lines to obtain an abortion, with some believing that states should impose restrictions, while others supported the ability to travel for reproductive healthcare.
	6.	Future of Abortion Debate: The group predicted that the debate over abortion would persist for years, as it touches on deeply held beliefs and moral values. They anticipated continued disagreement on whether abortion should be legal and under what conditions, even 50 years from now.
	7.	Political Implications: The issue of abortion was seen as crucial in shaping voting behavior. Participants emphasized the importance of understanding and respecting both the pro-life and pro-choice perspectives, with some expressing a desire for more balanced and reasonable discourse from both political parties. The group also considered the role of the government and elected officials in shaping abortion laws, especially in balancing personal freedoms and moral considerations.

In conclusion, the discussion highlighted the deep divisions and complex viewpoints on abortion in America. The focus group participants shared a range of opinions about the role of the Supreme Court, the alignment of abortion laws with public opinion, and the potential future of abortion legislation. Their views were shaped by religious, moral, and political beliefs, with an emphasis on balancing personal rights with societal values."

New 538 articles can be found at By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux Filed under Supreme Court Published Jun. 29, 2020 On Monday morning, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the courts liberals yet again to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that could have left the state with a single clinic. This case was one of the most-watched items on the docket this term for a reason. It was the first ruling on abortion since President Trump appointed two new justices to the court, which meant abortion-rights opponents were optimistic that a new conservative majority might be willing to undo past decisions on abortion rights even though the Louisiana law was basically identical to a Texas restriction that was struck down by the court in 2016. The laws banned doctors from providing abortions unless they had admitting privileges at a local hospital. Related The Supreme Court Put DACAs Fate In The Hands Of Voters It turned out this was a bad bet. Roberts ultimately wasnt willing to backtrack on what the court had so recently decided. The Louisiana law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons, he wrote in a separate opinion from the majority. Therefore Louisianas law cannot stand under our precedents. But this could turn out to be only a temporary setback for anti-abortion activists. Roberts made it clear that he still thinks the 2016 ruling was incorrect. This means abortion rights will likely be back on the Supreme Courts docket soon, and its very possible that in a future case, Roberts will be willing to uphold other restrictions that could severely limit access to the procedure. As the map below shows, states have passed plenty of different types of restrictions already. Todays ruling means that the center of gravity in the abortion debate will likely shift away from requirements placed on clinics particularly those that are similar to the ones struck down in Texas and Louisiana. According to the Guttmacher institute, a research organization that supports legal abortion, 14 states, including Louisiana and Texas, have passed admitting-privileges restrictions since 2011. The Supreme Court striking those laws down is a significant victory for abortion-rights supporters, because those types of restrictions were very onerous for doctors to comply with. A ruling in favor of Louisiana in this case would have almost certainly made it even harder to get an abortion in the state and perhaps also in other parts of the country. But as you can see in the chart above, there are still hundreds of other laws that limit abortion rights on the books. And a few kinds of laws that several Republican-controlled legislatures have recently passed could turn into the next big front in the abortion wars. Related If The Supreme Court Lets The Electoral College Vote However It Wants, Will Chaos Ensue? One such category includes bans on a specific second-trimester abortion procedure that involves dilating the patients cervix and removing the fetus in pieces on the chart, these are represented by the blue dots the category for restrictions on a certain type of abortion or for specific reasons. And according to Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law and the author of Abortion and the Law in America Roe v. Wade to the Present, anti-abortion advocates could argue that these bans are in line with a Supreme Court case decided in 2007, where the court upheld a federal ban on another commonly used method of second-trimester abortion. Another possibility is that anti-abortion opponents will start to focus on laws that ban abortion solely for specific reasons like when the fetus has genetic abnormalities, or if the goal is to ensure a child of a specific sex or race these are also represented by blue dots on the chart. The Supreme Court sidestepped ruling on one of these bans last year, leaving the possibility that they could return to the court in the future. Related Heres Why The Anti-Abortion Movement Is Escalating There are also many outright bans on abortion at different stages of pregnancy including laws like the one passed earlier this month in Tennessee, which would prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion starting around the sixth week of pregnancy.1 As I wrote last year, these types of bans are increasingly popular in the anti-abortion movement. But theyre riskier propositions from a legal perspective, because they directly challenge the courts original precedent in Roe v. Wade and theyre also not really in line with most Americans views about when abortion should be legal. That is, most Americans think Roe v. Wade should not be reversed, and many think abortion should be legal in the first trimester. Related Will The Supreme Court Finally Force Trumps Tax Returns To Be Released? So another option that could be more palatable both to Roberts and the general public is a set of restrictions that land closer to the threshold for fetal viability, which is around 22 weeks. That wouldnt necessarily involve a full-scale reversal of precedent, which Roberts seems reluctant to consider at this point. For instance, in todays case the court brushed aside anti-abortion advocates request to revisit several decades of precedent that allows abortion doctors to sue to protect or expand abortion rights on behalf of their patients, rather than forcing patients themselves to sue. Its hard to predict which of these restrictions are most likely to end up at the Supreme Court or how quickly that would happen. But Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said that while Robertss emphasis on maintaining precedent may prompt anti-abortion advocates to change their strategy, some of these other laws could get a warmer reception from the chief justice. There are just so many varieties of restrictions on abortion that the Supreme Court hasnt definitively weighed in on, she said. This kind of ruling is an invitation to bring them different kinds of restrictions.

This decision, made with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court’s liberal justices, reaffirmed the 2016 ruling against a similar Texas law. Despite this victory for abortion-rights supporters, Roberts indicated that he believed the 2016 ruling was incorrect, suggesting that future challenges to abortion rights could still be likely.

The ruling is significant for abortion rights advocates because it prevents the imposition of onerous requirements on abortion providers, which could have left Louisiana with only one clinic. However, anti-abortion activists are likely to focus on different types of restrictions in the future. These may include second-trimester abortion bans or laws targeting abortions for specific reasons, such as fetal abnormalities or sex selection. Such laws may be more strategically aligned with the Supreme Court’s precedents, particularly the 2007 ruling upholding a federal ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure.

There is also a growing trend of laws that outright ban abortions after a certain point in pregnancy, such as Tennessee’s law, which bans abortion after about six weeks. However, such laws present greater legal challenges as they directly conflict with the court’s Roe v. Wade precedent. A more likely path forward for anti-abortion advocates may be laws that limit abortion around the time of fetal viability, typically at 22 weeks. This would not necessitate a reversal of Roe v. Wade, making it potentially more palatable to Roberts and the public.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court’s decision in this case leaves open the possibility for a future shift in abortion policy, especially as a variety of new restrictions await potential challenges. Legal experts suggest that Roberts’ focus on maintaining precedent might prompt a change in strategy for anti-abortion groups, but they could bring different kinds of restrictions to the Court in the coming years."

By Sara Weissman You have 5 articles left.Sign up for a free account or log in. Create Free Account Login Benedictine College president Stephen D. Minnis and Catholic Healthcare International founder and president Jere D. Palazzolo sign an agreement to start plans for a new Catholic medical school. Benedictine College Officials at Benedictine College, a private Catholic institution in Atchison, Kan., recently announced plans to house a new, independent Catholic medical school on its campus. Part of the goal of the institution is to train physicians in an environment steeped in Catholic values related to contraception, abortion and end-of-life issues. The initiative, which is expected to cost 120 million, is a partnership with Catholic Healthcare International, an organization that aims to be a model of Christian healthcare delivery based on the work of Padre Pio, a Catholic priest and saint who opened a historic hospital in Italy. Catholic Healthcare International signed a collaboration agreement with Benedictine in early September to start planning the proposed medical school, dubbed the St. Padre Pio Institute for the Relief of Suffering, School of Osteopathic Medicine. It will be independently run and financed. The hope is for the medical school to gain accreditation and open its doors by 2026 it hopes to eventually enroll about 180 students annually who will earn a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree and take coursework in and potentially earn masters degrees in Catholic bioethics. Stephen D. Minnis, president of Benedictine, said he believes this will be one of the most faithful Catholic medical schools in the world. It is vital to train future doctors at a place like Benedictine College that understands the essential role of faith and morality in the sciences, Minnis said in a press release. The campus culture of community, faith, and scholarship that we have worked so hard to create will be the perfect home for the proposed Padre Pio medical school at Benedictine College. The announcement comes not long after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this past summer, ending federally protection for abortion rights and prompting student protests across the country. The decision elicited statements from campus leaders that ranged from denunciatory to celebratory to carefully neutral, and it plunged colleges and universities into uncharted legal waters on how to serve students who may want to terminate pregnancies while adhering to a patchwork of new state laws. The University of Idaho, for example, advised faculty members to refrain from sharing public opinions on the issue to avoid possible legal problems. The people behind the new medical school, however, are clear about where the schools policies will stand on abortion and forms of contraception, such as the morning-after pill, which Catholic doctrine views as a method for ending a life. Even if its in 24 hours, if its preventing the implantation of a fertilized ovum, under the Catholic doctrine, thats considered a person, said George Mychaskiw, the founding president and CEO of the future of the school. And you can use whatever euphemism you want, whether you sayits a clump of cells, an embryo, a fetus or a baby Its undeniably two things under the Catholic view Its undeniably alive. Its undeniably human. Its not kittens. Its not chicken eggs. Mychaskiw, who is currently professor and vice chair of anesthesiology and director of perioperative services at the Oschner Louisiana State University Health Science Center, said there are nine Catholic medical schools in the United States, but theyre nominally Catholic, essentially secular institutions under a religiously affiliated college or university. The St. Padre Pio Institute will be the first medical school in the country to adhere to Ex corde Ecclesiae, an ordinance issued by the late pope Saint John Paul II that governs whats expected of Catholic colleges and universities. As a result, the medical school will have a majority Catholic faculty, Catholic lay leaders and a Catholic Board of Directors. Instructors will also be required to sign a pledge of loyalty to Catholic principles, which includes life issues, such as continuing to give nutrition and fluids to terminal patients as part of palliative care and not performing abortions. He noted that these restrictions dont mean students wont be taught about abortion from a scientific perspective, but theyll also be taught the Catholic perspective on the subject and taught to counsel patients on carrying pregnancies to term and considering options such as adoption. Students will also learn Catholic doctrine on which contraceptive methods are acceptable and which are not. Theyll understand what abortion is, how theyre done, what medical issues are around abortion and complications, he said. But the school will also have the firm moral, Catholic position on the acceptability of abortion and any instances where its involved. So, it does take a moral position on that, but it doesnt shy from actually teaching about the science and technology. Carol Hogue, professor emerita of epidemiology and Jules and Uldeen Terry Professor Emerita of Maternal and Child Health at Emory University, expressed concern that training physicians in a rigid Catholic approach to medicine could contribute to maternal mortality. From the public health perspective, maternal mortality is the sixth leading cause of death among women age 16 to 34, and much of what Catholic doctrine forbids in Catholic hospitals speaks directly to saving womens lives who are pregnant and to avoiding pregnancy with effective contraceptives when they dont want to be pregnant, she said. I want to prevent lives from being lost, and they do not. Abortion is only a small part of it. Hogue pointed out that there have been lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for not providing timely abortions to women with ectopic pregnancies and other potentially fatal pregnancy complications. Daniel Sulmasy, director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics and a professor of medicine and philosophy at Georgetown University, a Jesuit institution, said he sees the new medical school as a positive development. He believes a faith-based medical education can foster a real sense of calling and mission in future doctors and train them to pay more attention the spiritual beliefs and needs of patients. He also noted that the student body at St. Padre Pio Institute will likely differ from most Catholic medical schools, which tend to attract high percentages of nonreligious students and hold a range of perspectives on issues like abortion. He said medical students at these institutions often train in Catholic teaching hospitals that adhere to Catholic principles and are taught Catholic perspectives on medical issues, but theyre also presented with secular perspectives, and robust discussions frequently happen in the classroom. For example, Sulmasy teaches a medical ethics course that includes the philosophy of Peter Singer, a bioethics scholar who argues that abortion is ethical. Sulmasy sees Georgetown as a place where students who are both in favor of and opposed to abortion rights can comfortably air their views and have a dialogue thats actually refreshing and open, where people are actually talking respectfully in ways I think cant happen about abortion in secular institutions. He believes even for a mostly antiabortion student body, Catholic medical ethics has to be taught in dialogue with opposing viewpoints, if for the only reason that if you want people to believe it, they have to be able to defend it, he said. Mychaskiw hopes to train physicians to work at Catholic hospitals across the country that would benefit from having doctors who are culturally comfortable in Catholic settings and familiar with the restrictions they follow. But he also foresees some of the students going on to work in secular hospitals. He believes training medical professionals, with a focus on high-quality academics but also Catholic philosophical underpinnings, is its own form of religious outreach. Our view of evangelization is that our physicians and their practice through the care and respect of every human life and dignity of life will then, through their work, serve as an example of how physicians in the Catholic tradition care for human beings, he said. Were not here to stand on the street corner and preach. Were here to take care of the sick and suffering, and through that, demonstrate, live out our faith. Health care is short all over, he added. I think, at the end of the day, whatever hospital Im in, I want a physician that really cares for me as a human, as a patient, and respects my life and dignity.

The proposed school, the St. Padre Pio Institute for the Relief of Suffering, School of Osteopathic Medicine, is a collaboration with Catholic Healthcare International. It will adhere strictly to Catholic teachings on issues like abortion, contraception, and end-of-life care, aligning with Catholic doctrine. This initiative aims to offer a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree, with an option for students to earn a master’s in Catholic bioethics. The school plans to open by 2026, enrolling around 180 students annually.

The medical school will be fully independent, and its faculty, board, and leadership will be Catholic, with instructors required to pledge loyalty to Catholic principles, particularly concerning life issues like abortion and euthanasia. While students will be taught scientific perspectives on topics like abortion, they will also receive Catholic moral guidance, focusing on options like adoption over abortion and rejecting contraceptives like the morning-after pill, which Catholic doctrine views as abortive.

This school is positioned to be the first in the U.S. to fully adhere to Ex corde Ecclesiae, an ordinance issued by Pope Saint John Paul II, ensuring its Catholic identity in all aspects. Critics, such as public health experts, express concerns that such an approach could negatively impact maternal health, particularly in situations requiring emergency care, but proponents argue that the school’s focus on ethical care will equip students to serve both Catholic and secular hospitals, with a special emphasis on compassion and the dignity of life.

The initiative, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, is seen as a response to the growing demand for healthcare professionals trained in faith-based principles, providing a distinct alternative to secular medical education. The goal is to prepare physicians who are equipped not only with medical expertise but also a deep understanding of Catholic ethics, which they can apply in a variety of healthcare settings."

The Democratic governors pre-emptive lawsuit, filed in Oakland County against prosecutors in 13 Michigan counties with an abortion clinic, came as the US Supreme Court considers allowing states to ban abortion much earlier in pregnancy and potentially overturning the right.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Jacksons US Supreme Court nomination moves forward in Senatelist 2 of 4Barrett takes US Supreme Court oath, deepening conservative griplist 3 of 4Brett Kavanaugh sworn in as US Supreme Court justicelist 4 of 4The US war on abortion rights will harm women everywhereend of list Planned Parenthood of Michigan and its chief medical officer filed a similar suit in the state Court of Claims to block enforcement of the 1931 law, which dates to an 1846 ban. With the old law still on its books, Michigan is one of 28 US states that would ban or be likely to ban abortions if the US Supreme Court reverses its 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade legalising abortion rights nationwide. Whitmer was expected to request that the Michigan Supreme Court quickly take her case rather than let it wind through lower trial and appellate courts. A favourable decision in Whitmers case would allow abortions to continue in Michigan even if the top federal court reverses Roe v Wade. It was important for us to take action now, to ensure that women and providers across the state of Michigan know whether abortions will still be available in the state because it impacts their lives and our healthcare providers practices, Whitmer told The Associated Press, saying nearly 2.2 million women may lose access to a safe, legal medical procedure. Its crucial that we take this action now to secure and ensure that the Michigan Constitution protects this right that we have had available for 49 years, she said. Michigans unenforced abortion ban was enacted before the 1973 Roe decision that legalised abortion. States on both sides of the abortion issue have been taking a variety of steps to prepare for Roe being eroded or rescinded, including making it a crime to perform an abortion or banning legal action against people who aid or receive an abortion. Michigans law makes it a felony to use an instrument or administer any substance with the intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman unless necessary to preserve her life. Stephen Parlato of Colorado holds a sign that reads Hands Off Roe! as rights advocates and protesters demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court in December 2021 File Andrew HarnikAP Photo Whitmer wants the Michigan Supreme Court to declare a state constitutional right to abortion and to strike down the 1931 law, a near total ban that the governor called one of the most extreme laws in the country. Her lawsuit argues that the law is invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. Calls to repeal the law have gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature. Whitmer will ask that the court intervene in part to avoid legal uncertainty when the federal high court issues its ruling on Mississippis ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The complaint says that while the Michigan Supreme Court in 1973 ruled that Roe limited the effect of the state ban, the right to abortion has been undermined over 50 years of litigation in federal courts. The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in 1997 that there is no constitutional right to abortion, but the states high court has never ruled on the question. Former President Donald Trumps seating of three justices gave the court a new, 6-3 conservative majority Jose Luis MaganaAP Photo Abortion rights advocates in Michigan have launched a ballot drive to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution,s but need about 425,000 voter signatures to put the initiative up to a vote in November. Meanwhile, seven Democratic county prosecutors who were named in Whitmers lawsuit pledged to not enforce the anti-abortion law. The other six elected prosecutors named are Republicans. We cannot and will not support criminalizing reproductive freedom or creating unsafe, untenable situations for healthcare providers and those who seek abortions in our communities, said a joint statement from the elected prosecutors of Michigans Wayne, Oakland, Genesee, Washtenaw, Ingham, Kalamazoo, and Marquette counties. Instead, we will continue to dedicate our limited resources towards the prosecution of serious crimes and the pursuit of justice for all. Whitmers case will be decided by four Democratic and three Republican justices on the state high court.

Wade. The lawsuit, filed in Oakland County, seeks to establish a right to abortion under Michigan’s state constitution and to invalidate the 1931 law, which bans most abortions and makes performing them a felony. This law, originally enacted in 1846, is one of the strictest in the U.S.

The lawsuit was filed as the U.S. Supreme Court was considering a case that could overturn Roe v. Wade and allow individual states to impose abortion bans. Whitmer’s legal action aims to ensure that Michigan residents have access to abortion services, even if the federal ruling changes. She emphasized the need to resolve the issue preemptively to avoid uncertainty for women and healthcare providers, noting that nearly 2.2 million women could lose access to legal abortions if the law is reinstated.

Whitmer’s lawsuit argues that the 1931 ban violates the state constitution’s due process and equal protection clauses. The Michigan Supreme Court has never ruled on abortion rights, and while the state Court of Appeals ruled in 1997 that there is no constitutional right to abortion, Whitmer’s lawsuit seeks to overturn this precedent.

In addition to the lawsuit, abortion rights advocates in Michigan launched a petition to amend the state constitution to explicitly protect abortion rights, aiming to gather enough signatures for a November vote. Meanwhile, seven Democratic county prosecutors in Michigan pledged not to enforce the 1931 law, emphasizing their commitment to protecting reproductive rights."

Chad Robertson Media Shutterstock.com After FIRE wrote to UNC Chapel Hills student government late last month about its repressive executive order cutting off a source of funding for pro-life student groups, both UNCs general counsel and its student body president, Taliajah Teddy Vann, assured FIRE that student group funding will continue in a viewpoint-neutral manner consistent with the First Amendment. FIRE appreciates UNCs commitment to ensuring student organizations have equal access to university resources, regardless of their views. On July 6, Vann issued a sweeping executive order banning contracts or funding to any individual, business, or organization which actively advocates to further limit by law access to reproductive healthcare. As written, the order plainly applies to student organizations, specifically the UNC Students for Life chapter, which is dedicated to pro-life advocacy. FIREs July 28 letter to Vann explained how the First Amendment bars student governments from restricting funding to student clubs due to their mission or advocacy even when their expression may be controversial or offensive. However, UNC Associate Vice Chancellor and Senior University Counsel Kara E. Simmons assured FIRE that the executive order does not apply to student groups because there is no mechanism for them to request funding from the executive branch. Simmons promised that, even if clubs could request executive branch funds, the student government and university administration would ensure that any funding would be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, per UNC policy and the First Amendment. Simmons further clarified that the executive order would in no way limit groups like Students for Life from receiving student activity fee funding from the broader student government. Student governments cant selectively fund student groups whose views they share, while denying resources to clubs whose views they dislike In an Aug. 5 letter to FIRE, Vann herself clarified that the viewpoint-neutral allocation of funds to RSOs registered student organizations at UNC is not officiated by the Executive Branch and is not threatened by Executive Order No. 2. FIRE routinely engages with universities when their administrations or student governments appear poised to deny resources to student groups with unpopular or controversial views. The UNC episode underscores how carefully student governments must tread when making rules that could impact other students expressive rights. Student governments at public universities act as agents of the government when doling out the student activity fee to campus clubs seeking funding, and are therefore bound by the First Amendment. Supreme Court precedent allows the collection of mandatory student activity fees by public universities, so long as every student group has an equal opportunity to obtain funds regardless of their creed or mission. Student governments cant selectively fund student groups whose views they share, while denying resources to clubs whose views they dislike. This viewpoint-neutrality requirement fosters the free exchange of ideas by protecting the right of minority and unpopular student organizations to function as viable campus groups. The vibrant diversity of clubs affords UNC students ample opportunities to find like-minded individuals to add their voices together. One need look no further than UNC itself to see this system in action. As a school with strong free speech policies earning FIREs highest, green light rating, UNC has more than 800 different student groups many with opposing missions all able to flourish on campus. The vibrant diversity of clubs affords UNC students ample opportunities to find like-minded individuals to add their voices together. If student leaders and administrators defunded every group that potentially offended them, there would be precious few clubs left for students to join. While student leaders may take stances on contested political issues such as abortion, they may not condition funding on student groups adhering to these stances. Despite the initial uncertainty, were glad to see UNCs student government commit to funding student organizations in a viewpoint-neutral manner that respects a diversity of voices. Going forward, we encourage all student government leaders to draft executive orders with clarity, precision, and an eye toward protecting their constituents First Amendment rights.

The executive order, issued by student body president Taliajah Teddy Vann on July 6, sought to prevent funding for organizations that advocate to restrict reproductive healthcare access, specifically targeting the UNC Students for Life chapter.

FIRE wrote to the student government, emphasizing that the First Amendment prohibits restricting funding for student groups based on their views, even if their stances are controversial. In response, both the university’s general counsel and Vann clarified that student funding would continue in a viewpoint-neutral manner. They assured FIRE that student groups, including those with pro-life advocacy, would still be able to receive funding from the broader student government, which distributes student activity fees without discrimination. Vann further emphasized that the executive order did not affect the funding process for registered student organizations (RSOs).

FIRE stressed the importance of viewpoint-neutral funding policies at public universities, highlighting that student governments, as agents of the government, cannot selectively fund organizations based on the political or ideological alignment of their views. The case illustrated the importance of protecting diverse student organizations and ensuring equal access to university resources, which promotes free expression and campus dialogue. UNC, known for its strong free speech policies, reaffirmed its commitment to these principles.

FIRE concluded by urging student governments to ensure clarity and precision in their executive orders to avoid infringing on the First Amendment rights of students."

Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Sitt signed a bill Tuesday that would make providing an abortion a felony punishable by a maximum fine of 100,000 or a 10-year prison sentence. In one of the strictest abortion restrictions to date, the law makes exceptions only for medical emergencies. Oklahoma had become familiar with picking up after its neighbors since Texas' Senate Bill 8 was enacted, effectively outlawing abortions past six weeks of pregnancy. Now, Oklahomans may lose their own access to abortion, causing a ripple effect for residents of neighboring states who have relied heavily on the state for abortion care. ""Overall, we saw about a 2,500 increase in patients coming to Oklahoma's health centers from Texas,"" said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which serves Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. 'You can't really be prepared' Oklahoma has only four abortion centers. Since September, when Texas' ban was passed, those centers have seen several thousand more people from out of state. It's resulted in longer wait times for patients seeking abortions, more hours for physicians to meet demand and increased staffing to ensure coverage. ""You can't really be prepared,"" Wales said, as the need for abortion care in Oklahoma skyrocketed almost overnight after Texas' law went into effect. To meet that demand, Oklahoma allowed ""fly-in"" physicians, or providers from other states who came to offer care for people flooding from Texas. But Oklahoma's abortion providers not only found themselves facing the sheer rise in patient numbers, they struggled with the unique emotional burdens that came with them. ""So many patients were coming with really high emotional needs,"" Wales said. ""It's already really challenging because of state restrictions, but you add on to that, potentially, a trip overnight, finding a place to keep your kids while you are seeking care in another state and just feeling like your actions are criminalized in your home state. That was a level of intense support needs that our team has really struggled to fill."" Anticipating the fallout from her own state's restrictions, Wales said that it leaves even fewer options for a safe abortion in that part of the country. ""When you take out another state that's been a huge provider of services for the region, the system is going to break. It's not a question of whether that will happen, it's just when,"" Wales said. She said Planned Parenthood plans to try to block the measure in court before it can come into effect. ""The fact that the same nightmare we've been living -- with our Texas patients -- is now going to happen in Oklahoma is heartbreaking for us on the provider level,"" Wales said. People in Oklahoma may have to travel to Kansas, New Mexico or Colorado to get abortions. ""Bans do not eliminate the need for abortion care they just make it a lot less safe,"" she said. Crossing state lines Oklahoma's abortion providers aren't alone. Several states across the country have found themselves turning into potential safety nets for abortion care as their neighbors move to limit access. For several months before Republican Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed his state's version of Texas' notoriously restrictive abortion law, abortion providers just across state lines in Washington and Oregon have been preparing for the consequences. ""We have been tracking and watching this bill for the past six months, once Texas passed and we began to understand how many states were going to be lined up to do the same thing,"" said Anne Udall, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette, the branch overseeing seven clinics in Oregon and Southwest Washington. Idaho's Senate Bill 1309 was set to go into effect April 22 before it was temporarily blocked by the state's Supreme Court. The measure would allow a fetus' family members to bring legal action against any health care worker who helps provide an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is generally around six weeks of gestation. ""We knew this was coming. . We were getting ready for it, and we continue to get ready for it, because it will impact Oregon,"" Udall said. Though Idaho's Supreme Court decision has temporarily paused its legislation that could limit access to abortion, a US Supreme Court decision, expected in June, that could overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling has abortion providers in neighboring states still bracing for an influx of patients. ""There's been a decrease of 60 of abortions in Texas since the law was passed in September, and I'm sure that's going to happen to Idaho, as well,"" said Dr. Mark Nichols, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University. ""Because the biggest population in Idaho is in Boise, likely they will be coming across the Oregon border and seeking abortion care in Oregon,"" which has one of the least-restrictive abortion laws in the country. As of 2019, the latest year for which data is available, 9 of abortions provided in Oregon were for out-of-state residents, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number could increase significantly if Idaho's abortion law is enacted. According to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, nearly 70 of abortions there take place after six weeks. That accounts for over 1,000 people a year who would no longer have access to an abortion in Idaho. The easternmost abortion clinic in Oregon is in the city of Bend, about 300 miles from Boise -- how far most people would have to travel to get an abortion if Idaho's bill were to go into effect. In preparation, Planned Parenthood is ensuring that all of its clinics are fully staffed. In states like Oregon and Washington, non-physician health care providers, such as nurse practitioners and midwives, can provide abortions, which helps support the provider base to meet increasing needs. Idaho's law would affect access to abortion not only for Idahoans but for Oregonians. According to Dr. Erin Berry, Washington medical director and director of clinical research at Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Kentucky, the closest clinic for some people seeking abortions in eastern Oregon is in Idaho. Idaho also serves people from Nevada and Montana, said Berry, an obgyn and abortion provider in Idaho and Washington. Anticipating the ramifications of Idaho's abortion bill, the Oregon State Legislature passed House Bill 5202, which includes a 15 million allocation for the state's Reproductive Equity Fund. The money ""will provide meaningful and immediate support to patients, health providers and community advocates to prepare for Idaho's imminent passage of a six-week abortion ban and an anticipated Supreme Court decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade,"" the organization Pro-Choice Oregon said in a statement. The costs of acquiring an out-of-state abortion go beyond just the procedure itself. Things like child care, taking time off work, traveling and lodging compound the logistical hoops pregnant people have to jump through. According to Udall, this funding will help offset travel expenses and lodging for people seeking abortions in Oregon. Nevertheless, Idaho's abortion bill, like many other forms of legislation that restrict abortion access, will disproportionately affect low-income and minority populations. ""When you talk about funding for abortion care, it's those women who most need abortions who I think are going to be most impacted poor women, women of color, who don't necessarily have the ability to, for example, travel from Boise to the current clinic in Bend, Oregon,"" Nichols said. Pushing wait times Oregon's northern neighbor, Washington, will also probably see an influx of patients from Idaho. One thing Berry is concerned about is the effect this will have on wait times for abortion care. There is now a one- to three-week wait in Idaho and a wait of up to two weeks in Washington. ""Covid has put a major stress on the health care system. There's staffing shortages across health care, and that affects abortion clinics as well. It's very common for us to be scheduled two or even three weeks out to get an appointment for an abortion,"" she said. Those couple weeks can be the difference between being able to get a legal abortion in Idaho and being beyond the gestation limit. Even if people in Idaho decide to have an abortion before six weeks of pregnancy, they may not be able to book an appointment until it's too late and would have to go elsewhere. Postal care Those who will be seeking an out-of-state abortion can choose a surgical abortion or a medication abortion, the most common type of abortion provided. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, most patients at 70 days, or ten weeks, gestation are eligible for a medication abortion. Medication abortions can now take place over telehealth patients can do a telemedicine intake and then receive a two-drug combo. Just this past year, the US Food and Drug Administration decided to permanently allow these pills to be sent through the mail. However, according to providers in Washington and Oregon, patients will still need to be physically present in those states to receive telemedical abortion care. Once they complete their intake, they can return home to get and take the mailed pills. Not all states have the same policies surrounding telemedical abortions. In places like Oklahoma, patients have always needed a clinician to be physically present when taking the pills. Five states, including Arizona and Texas, ban telemedical abortions altogether. For those choosing to undergo surgical abortions, which makes up a minority of procedures, patients might be able to get the care they need in a day. ""Folks from Idaho . could come to a clinic in Oregon, be seen by a provider with an Oregon license, receive their care and go back to their home in Idaho. In most cases, that will all happen in one visit,"" Nichols said. Unlike several other states, Oregon and Washington do not have mandatory waiting periods for abortion. Looking to Roe Even as some states push forward on laws to restrict abortions, others are responding with laws meant to safeguard access. Last month, Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that would block lawsuits brought against abortion providers, by the state or by private citizens, in response to Texas' law. Last week, Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill that establishes the right to an abortion there. And this past weekend, Maryland's legislators overrode Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's veto of the Abortion Care Access Act to secure a bill that expands eligible abortion providers. Many of these decisions are motivated by concerns over the increasing possibility that Roe v. Wade will be overturned. The 1973 Supreme Court ruling made access to safe abortion during the first two terms of pregnancy a constitutional right. In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, fetal viability became the new benchmark for protected abortions. A fetus is generally considered viable, or capable of surviving outside the womb, at 22 to 24 weeks, so state laws that ban abortions before then would be considered unconstitutional -- though that hasn't stopped states from passing and enforcing those laws. ""There is nothing that prevents a state legislature from passing a law that is unconstitutional, either under the federal constitution or that state constitution,"" said Elisabeth Smith, director for state policy and advocacy with the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""The ability to enact unconstitutional laws is not prohibited that ability is alive and well."" Only a court can decide whether a law is unconstitutional, but the law needs to make it to the docket in the first place. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization, 26 states will probably move to prohibit abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned. States like North Carolina, which would continue to allow abortions, will see an over 4,600 increase in patients coming from surrounding states that enact total bans, Guttmacher estimates. ""People are likely going to have to seek abortions for thousands of miles,"" Berry said of a future without Roe. ""It's going to lead to a lot of people being forced to carry pregnancies to term.""

Not Now Turn On","As several states, primarily Republican-led, move to restrict abortion access, neighboring states are bracing for an increase in demand for abortion services. For example, after Texas enacted a law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, Oklahoma became a key provider of abortion care for Texans. However, Oklahoma is now introducing its own strict abortion law, which could force residents to travel to states like Kansas or Colorado. This has already caused a surge in demand at Oklahoma’s four abortion centers, resulting in longer wait times and increased emotional strain on providers.

Other states, such as Idaho, are also enacting restrictive abortion laws similar to Texas, prompting concerns in neighboring states like Oregon and Washington. In preparation for the influx of patients, these states are increasing staff and funding, such as Oregon’s allocation of $15 million to support abortion care. The situation disproportionately affects low-income and minority individuals who may not have the resources to travel long distances for care.

Additionally, some states, including Oregon and Washington, are expanding access to abortion services by allowing non-physician providers to perform abortions and removing mandatory waiting periods. In contrast, some states are pushing laws to safeguard abortion access, such as Washington’s law blocking lawsuits against abortion providers and Maryland’s expansion of eligible providers through the Abortion Care Access Act.

The potential overturn of Roe v. Wade could further intensify the situation, with an estimated 26 states expected to prohibit abortions. This would lead to a significant increase in out-of-state patients seeking care, potentially forcing many individuals to travel long distances and face financial and logistical barriers."

Photo Tom WilliamsCQ-Roll CallGetty Images Commentary By Father Dave Pivonka, TOR, is the president of Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio. Ive attended the March for Life in Washington, D.C., numerous times since they began in the mid-1970s, but this year, I have a sense of anticipation and excitement like Ive never experienced before. Along with other pro-lifers around the country, Im encouraged to see better protections for our smallest citizens in Texas and Alabama. Im also encouraged to see the U.S. Supreme Court take up Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, a case out of Mississippi that some observers think could open the door to overturning Roe v. Wade almost 50 years after it effectively removed every legal protection from preborn human beings. We can celebrate those milestones as real progress, and if even one innocent baby is saved as a result, then the decades of struggle, prayer, and sacrifice have been worth it. Every single human life has such profound value, meaning, and purpose, beyond anything we can imagine. Tragically, abortion will not disappear in the United States even if Roe v. Wade, the 1973 high court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, is overturned. Instead, the battleground will simply shift, and the fight against abortion will continue as each state seeks to regulate abortion for its residentsand depending on where we live, the new abortion laws may very well be more horrific than they are now. Thats why we do well to remember that a change of hearts, not merely a change of law, must be the goal of the pro-life cause. Thats because abortion is ultimately a question of the heart, a question of recognizing the beauty of each human life. The heart of a baby starts beating about 22 days after conception. Her heart will continue to beat until she is called home. This babys heart will experience all that a human heart can experience a heart full of joy and peace a heart broken a heart full of love. We pray for the hearts of all babies, that abortion will not stop them from beating. Yet our endgame must also include a change of millions of older hearts, so our whole culture respects human life at every stage. Now, only God can create a human heart. Only He can change the hearts of those who do not yet recognize the dignity of each personbut we can help. An article I read recently about one of our online masters degree students at Franciscan University illustrates this beautifully. Nineteen and unmarried, Kelly planned to abort her baby for the sake of her careerand attempted to do so three times. The first time, she was put off by a chance remark from the abortion clinic receptionist the second, by people praying outside the clinic and the third time, stalled in traffic as her appointment time came and went, Kelly saw a Choose Life license plate on the car ahead of her. I doubt the people praying outside the clinic or the owner of that license plate have any idea how powerful their prayers and witness were. But at least in part because of them, Kelly and her boyfriends hearts were changed, and they chose life for their son. They married, and Kelly went on to start a pregnancy resource center. Later, convinced that abortion is the consequence of a culture thats denied the dignity of the human person and of the need to reach women before they head to an abortion clinic, she co-founded the Pelican Project, an online resource to support parents in educating their children about the sanctity of life. Like Kelly, we need to pray and work for the transformation of hearts to love for life, particularly for the hearts of those most vulnerable and particularly those who cannot see the innate dignity of the human person. We need to be Christ for others, to love them, to show them kindness and mercy, and trust that God will use our efforts to bring changethe change that does not depend on the courts or the legislature, but on the conviction of our culture that every human life deserves protection and should receive it from conception to natural death.

While legal victories, such as the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade and the implementation of abortion restrictions in states like Texas and Alabama, are significant, the article argues that abortion will not truly end until there is a widespread cultural shift that values the sanctity of life at every stage.

Father Pivonka reflects on his experiences at the March for Life and expresses hope that legal protections for the unborn will increase. However, he warns that even if Roe v. Wade is overturned, the fight against abortion will continue in different forms, as states will vary in their abortion laws, some potentially becoming more extreme.

The article then shifts to focus on personal transformation, using the story of Kelly, a young woman who initially considered abortion but changed her mind due to external influences such as prayers and witnessing pro-life messages. Kelly later became an advocate for life, founding a pregnancy resource center and an online project to educate parents on the sanctity of life. This example illustrates how individual hearts can change through prayer, kindness, and compassionate outreach.

Father Pivonka concludes by urging the pro-life movement to work not only for legislative changes but also for a cultural shift where every human life, from conception to natural death, is respected. He advocates for showing Christ-like love and mercy to others, believing that this can bring about lasting change in society’s views on life."

Photo Sue OgrockiAP The states new ban is the most extreme in the country, going further than Texass notorious S.B. 8 by banning abortion after fertilization. Jordan Smith May 20 2022, 1215 p.m. In the waning days of their legislative session, Oklahoma lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that would immediately outlaw all abortion in the state. The bill is awaiting the signature of Gov. Kevin Stitt, who has vowed to sign any anti-abortion legislation sent to his desk. Theres no denying This is a very dark day, and unfortunately, dark days are ahead, Rabia Muqaddam, senior legal counsel with the Center for Reproductive Rights, said on a press call. The latest attack on abortion in Oklahoma comes on the heels of Politicos publication of a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito in a pending Mississippi case that would topple the constitutional right to abortion first acknowledged in Roe v. Wade. The final opinion in that case, Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, is expected late next month. Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I'm in The new Oklahoma ban is modeled after the notorious Texas Senate Bill 8, which banned abortion after six weeks, long before many people even know theyre pregnant. Texas lawmakers sought to shield their law from court challenges by outsourcing its enforcement to private individuals as opposed to a state actor like the attorney general. The law allows literally anyone to bring a private civil suit against any health care provider they believe may have violated the ban or person they believe may have aided or abetted a patient seeking an abortion after six weeks. That could include a friend or family member who lends a patient money or drives them to a clinic. S.B. 8 also allows individuals to sue those who intend to take action that might violate the law. Although S.B. 8 is blatantly unconstitutional under current law, which protects the right to abortion up until fetal viability, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene, allowing Texass ban to take effect last fall. The courts decision to look the other way has unmoored states from adhering to the rule of law, prompting a host of copycat legislation, including Oklahomas latest and most extreme House Bill 4327. Most Read Secret Pentagon Program Echoes Pedophile Ring in True Detective Series Ken Klippenstein Lawsuits About FBI Warrantless Search of Safe Deposit Boxes Allowed to Proceed Shawn Musgrave TikTok Threat Is Purely Hypothetical, U.S. Intelligence Admits Oklahomas ban goes further than Texass. Not only does it outlaw all abortion, but it also attempts to strip Oklahomas state courts from any jurisdiction to consider whether the law violates state constitutional protections. Thats important because the states constitution has been interpreted as granting wide privacy protections, and state courts have repeatedly blocked various abortion restrictions from taking effect. The bill also contains an emergency clause that would allow it to take effect immediately, which would deliver a crushing blow to abortion access across the region. When S.B. 8 took effect last September, Texas patients flooded into Oklahoma and the surrounding states in search of care. That in turn has displaced home-state patients, delayed appointments, and forced more people to seek care farther from home. If Oklahoma lawmakers are successful in shutting down access altogether even if only temporarily the consequences will reverberate across the regions increasingly stretched network of providers. Our government is not interested in keeping us safe or healthy. They are interested in surveilling and criminalizing our communities. Oklahoma lawmakers have long pushed the envelope in their efforts to legislate abortion out of existence. Just this year, theyve passed three separate bans on abortion. In addition to H.B. 4327, lawmakers passed a ban in April that would criminalize abortion and subject providers to prison time. That measure, slated to take effect in August, contains an exception in the case of a medical emergency, defined in part as a condition which cannot be remedied by delivery of the child. Weeks later, lawmakers passed a six-week copycat ban, Senate Bill 1503, which also strips state courts of jurisdiction to consider legal challenges. The ban includes an exception for a medical emergency, but none for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. The newest ban, H.B. 4327, does include a rape or incest exception, but only if the assault has been reported to police. Stitt readily signed the first two bills into law. The six-week ban took effect May 3. During the April signing ceremony for the criminalization bill, Stitt was asked what Oklahoma could do to deal with all the Texans coming to the state in search of care. You mean have Highway Patrol arrest the Texans that come across our border? he joked as laughter broke out in the room. This bill will take care of that. We certainly dont want Texans coming up to Oklahoma. Dr. Iman Alsaden, medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which provides abortion services in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas, was anything but amused during the call after H.B. 4327 passed. The fact that Oklahoma politicians are proud of passing todays total abortion ban is an embarrassment to our state, she said. Todays actions make clear that our government is not interested in keeping us safe or healthy. They are interested in surveilling and criminalizing our communities. There is no aspect of what is happening with these abortion bans in Oklahoma that is normal. It is truly insane. Oklahomas passage of multiple bans has created confusion. In addition to the three passed this year, the state already had a trigger law on the books that would ban abortion if Roe is overturned. Two additional bans were passed in 2021, both of which are currently in litigation. The Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to block the six-week copycat law from taking immediate effect in May, but that measure is also the subject of pending litigation in the lower courts. When H.B. 4327 is signed, Muqaddam said, it will be added to the growing pile of legal challenges. The Oklahoma Legislature repeatedly enacts overlapping laws in an insane way that makes no sense, Muqaddam said. There is no aspect of what is happening with these abortion bans in Oklahoma that is normal. It is truly insane. Which of Oklahomas bans might be the controlling law should the U.S. Supreme Court strike down Roe as expected remains to be seen. The situation has also confused patients, who have been calling clinics wondering if abortion is still legal. It is, said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, but it has never been more in danger. Still, providers and advocates said they will continue to do everything possible to help patients navigate their way to care. Theres really no rhyme or reason to how Oklahoma is proceeding, Muqaddam said, other than a radical attempt to just confuse people, create chaos, and wreak as much havoc as they can possibly do on people who are seeking abortion and the providers who provide it.

All rights reserved","Oklahoma’s recent abortion ban, House Bill 4327 (H.B. 4327), represents the most extreme abortion restriction in the U.S., going further than Texas’ Senate Bill 8 (S.B. 8). This new law completely bans abortion from the moment of fertilization and removes state courts’ jurisdiction to challenge the law, a significant move given that Oklahoma’s constitution has historically protected privacy rights. The law is set to take effect immediately, disrupting access to abortion care not only in Oklahoma but throughout the region, particularly as neighboring states like Texas have already implemented similar restrictions.

H.B. 4327 is part of a broader series of anti-abortion legislation passed in Oklahoma, which includes a criminalization bill that penalizes providers and a six-week ban that mirrors Texas’ law. This intense legislative push is fueled by a larger movement to dismantle abortion access, particularly as the U.S. Supreme Court nears a decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which may overturn Roe v. Wade. In response, Oklahoma has created a confusing and chaotic legal environment with overlapping and sometimes contradictory bans, causing uncertainty among both patients and providers.

Critics argue that the law aims to surveil and criminalize those seeking abortions, with some even joking about using law enforcement to prevent Texans from coming to Oklahoma for care. Abortion advocates, including medical providers like Dr. Iman Alsaden of Planned Parenthood, emphasize that the real goal is not public health but a radical agenda to criminalize reproductive rights. The situation in Oklahoma underscores the growing efforts to restrict abortion access nationwide, as well as the dangers of increasingly restrictive and chaotic state laws. Despite these challenges, abortion rights advocates vow to continue helping patients navigate these changes and provide care where possible."

Join our Lenten Campaign 2024. PLEASE MAKE A DONATION TO ALETEIAAleteia spoke with the actor Eduardo Verstegui, who has has taken the occasion of the coronavirus pandemic to call on the world to pray the Rosary together.Aleteia A million people praying the Rosary an incredible undertaking and a beautiful inspiration. How did you decide to take up this challenge with your friends on social networks, from various places in the world, cultures and languages?Eduardo Verstegui I believe that even without speaking the same language, we can create unity we understand each other because we pray. Its a form of reconciliation of the world across the borders, cultures and languages of different nations. Were a family and we complement each other.The pandemic has caused us to lock ourselves up in our homes. It was very difficult for me because I didnt know what was going to happen. I was accustomed to traveling continuously, and the lockdown meant that someone had clipped my wings. Thats how I felt during the first two weeks. I thought about the fact that my parents were at our family home elsewhere, my siblings were in the United States, and I was at my home. In the end I realized I had to thank God for having a place to live and having the means to live, and that was beautiful.fot. archiwum prywatneHowever, I couldnt think only about myself, but also about other people, wholike meare also locked up in their homes, but have no financial means or credit cards. There are poor families, mainly big ones, who live from day to day. They dont have the internet or access to social networks, so I thought I had to do something to help these families that are in such a difficult situation. So, through a movement called Viva Mxico, I contacted Caritas to join forces with them and help these people. We created a movement called Dona Despensas Donate Food Baskets. In this movement, we make food baskets for the poor, and weve already managed to prepare 60,000 packages for the neediest families. However, this wasnt enough for me. I felt I had to do more. Id made a daily schedule for myself during the pandemic hours of work, study, and physical exercise, and also time for prayer. But I was home alone all day. I know that man is never alone and Im aware that God is always with me, but humanly speaking, I was alone.Therefore, I thought that I could use social networks to pray together. Why not? I didnt want to pray alone anymore. I wanted to connect with people. It was before Sunday, March 22, that I spontaneously wrote that we could pray together for life. I thought that possibly some people would be interested, maybe a hundred, or that maybe I would pray alone on the internet. But it was a great surprise to see that 10,000 people joined me in my initiative for this prayer. I was pleasantly surprised, because the Rosary is a long prayer and when transmitted on the internet it lasts almost an hour. I told everyone Well, if weve done this on a Sunday, lets also pray on Monday. And so it was on Monday, Tuesday, and continued every day. As May 13 approached, I told them that we had a new challenge, which was to pray exceptionally on this day. I thought that there would be about 50,000 people joining us. It turned out that there were over 200,000 people praying. It was the Rosary of Fatima!For me, it was a miracle that there were so many people. The next day, after May 13, I was so moved that I said on the social networks that we should prepare for a new challenge one million people by May 31, at the celebration of Pentecost.Were celebrating the centenary of the birth of St. John Paul all year long. Did you have the opportunity to meet him?Yes, and I thank God very much for that. The meeting was beautiful that was where I began my new way of life in which I discovered my new mission. I can say that my life changed when I met John Paul II I received a rosary from his hands and I asked for his blessing. I told the pope that I make films in defense of life and the Holy Father listened to me, blessed me and made a cross on my forehead. A few months later he died. The meeting took place in the Paul VI Hall in November 2004 and he died in April 2005.For me, he is not only a saint, but also a man who had his passions. There was a time when he was an actor like me, so I appreciate him more and feel more attached to him. He used art to show true values and to fight against evilcommunism, for example. I believe that art, such as cinema, influences society a great deal, and therefore can become a tool for spiritual combat. Art in this sense can also help transform the world.fot. archiwum prywatneThe life and example of John Paul II continues to be a great inspiration to me. He dedicated part of his life to helping and saving his country, Poland I also want to fight spiritually for my country, Mexico. I want to inspire others to love more, to live life with love and faith, and thus to change the world. John Paul IIas a priest, and later as a bishop and popehad a great impact on society. He left his mark on our history. Through his encounters with young people, as at World Youth Days, he changed the world. I must also admit that I admire how he lived his old age, when he was already very weak and sick despite these difficulties, he had extraordinary spiritual strength and intellect. He is an example for me to follow.What are your family and relatives memories of John Paul IIs first historic pilgrimage to Mexico?Not only my family, but everyone remembers this pilgrimage. John Paul II wasnt only a pope whom the whole world admired here in Mexico we received him as someone very closewe Mexicans treated him as just another Mexican. During his pilgrimages, the Pope said that Mexico is always faithful. The Holy Father had a special devotion and love for the Mother of God of Guadalupe. It was he who, more than 500 years after the apparitions, canonized Juan Diego, whose indigenous name means messenger eagle. Thats why St. John Paul II is very much loved and recognized as a friend in Mexico. Im convinced that now, as a saint from heaven, hes interceding for us and joins us all when we pray the Rosary.You recently composed a song called Quiero vivir I Want to Live. What inspired you to write it?I imagined how children in the womb would sing to their mother if they had a voice. What would these children talk to their parents about? Thinking about that, this song Quiero vivir arose we put our skills, our voices in the mouths of these children who cannot sing yet. I also believe that its a mission that God has entrusted to me to use my talents and my abilities to fight in defense of life, especially that of the unborn, those little unborn and defenseless children, because they have no voice and cannot defend themselves, but they have a right to life.Being pro-life encompasses more it also means defending children who have no food, as well as those who are kidnapped, sold and sexually abused. Human trafficking is a big problem, and we must do everything possible to stop this crime. Its hard to believe, but millions of children are abused and sold. Being pro-life means protecting the life and dignity of every child. Pro-life also means supporting young people who need help because theyre addicted to drugs or alcohol. We have to do something for them for me, all of this is part of being pro-life. It means defending those who are unjustly condemned or imprisoned and dont have the economic means to defend themselves, to hire a lawyer. Being pro-life is also about helping the elderly. There are several programs that put young people in touch with the elderly. In retirement homes, there are many lonely, abandoned people who dont receive any visits, even from anyone in their family. We create programs for young people to be with older people. All these activities are also pro-life. Pro-life means protecting life from conception to natural death. This is a beautiful and unique mission for me.If every mother had a womb like glass so that she could see her child before birth, none of them would have an abortion. Everything Ive mentioned is very important to me thats why my film Bella and the short films I make talk about this. The film Unplanned managed to bring together various kinds of people involved in pro-life activitiesartists, politicians, etc.to defend life. Last year we advertised the film Unplanned for months. We traveled around the 32 states of Mexico with this film. Thats when the idea of the song Quiero vivir came up.Youre an actor, musician and film director. Do you feel like a warrior fighting for a good cause you believe in?If God gives you the possibility and the perspective of supernatural life, after a time during which you wasted many years of life, when you realize it, you want to give everything for Jesus and entrust your life to Him. Now I feel like a child of God who does everything to change this world for the better, and I want to live like that. I hope that in this way I can reach the holiness to which God calls us all. Thats how I want to live, overcoming all difficulties.Thank you very much for the interview.Note Eduardo Verstegui will be leading the praying of the Rosary in Spanish for the intentions of respect for life and an end to violence in the United States of America, on Sunday, June 7, at 1 p.m. Central Daylight Time, the time zone of cities including Chicago and Mexico City.

Verástegui recounts how the COVID-19 pandemic led him to unite people globally through prayer, organizing a worldwide online Rosary for life. This initiative started as a spontaneous idea to pray together for life, and quickly gained momentum, attracting hundreds of thousands of participants, reaching over a million by May 31, 2020.

Verástegui also reflects on his personal encounter with Pope John Paul II in 2004, which profoundly influenced his life and mission. During their meeting, Verástegui shared his passion for creating films that defend life, and John Paul II blessed his work. He admired the pope’s commitment to fighting for life, his spiritual resilience in old age, and his deep devotion to Mexico, which Verástegui shares. The actor also expresses admiration for the pope’s role in shaping history, particularly his impact on the youth through World Youth Days and his defense against communism.

Verástegui’s commitment to the pro-life cause is highlighted in his work, including his film Bella and the song Quiero Vivir (“I Want to Live”), which expresses the imagined voice of unborn children. For Verástegui, being pro-life means advocating for the rights and dignity of every human being, from conception to natural death. He emphasizes that the pro-life movement goes beyond abortion and includes efforts to protect children from abuse, human trafficking, addiction, and neglect, as well as supporting the elderly.

Throughout the interview, Verástegui frames his activism as part of a larger spiritual mission. He views his artistic talents as tools for promoting good and inspiring others to embrace a life of faith, love, and service. His conviction is that every life, from the unborn to the elderly, deserves protection and respect. His commitment to this cause continues to drive his career, especially in his efforts to create art that reflects and promotes these values."

Tate Reeves pauses during applause as he delivers his State of the State Address from the south steps of the State Capitol in Jackson, Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022. In an op-ed titled The New Pro-Life Agenda, Gov. Tate Reeves wrote that the pro-life movement must be more than anti-abortion but he offered few specifics about plans to improve the lives of mothers and babies in Mississippi, which ranks last in the country in most indicators of child well-being. Reeves said in the op-ed published Thursday that Mississippi will strengthen our social services infrastructure and build grant programs for expectant mothers following the likely end to legal abortion in Mississippi. Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the country and the countrys highest rate of children living in poverty. And in 2020, the state recorded the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reeves office did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today about how much money his administration would invest in those programs and whether the governor would support extending postpartum Medicaid coverage for new moms a measure that died in the Legislature this year. About 60 of pregnant women in Mississippi are on Medicaid. The opinion piece was published in the Washington Stand, a news outlet run by the Family Research Council, a conservative evangelical organization that opposes abortion and LGBTQ rights. The op-ed covered much of the same ground Reeves presented in interviews on national television in May after the leak of a draft opinion showing the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe. The ruling in the Mississippi case, Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, will likely come later this month. Being pro-life is about more than just being anti-abortion, he wrote. It requires working to ensure that every child who is brought into the world, no matter their situation, is given every opportunity for future success. During the 2022 legislative session, Sen. Kevin Blackwell, R-Southaven authored a bill to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to a year after childbirth. He pitched it as a pro-life measure, and it garnered broad bipartisan support in the Senate, but Speaker of the House Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, killed the legislation. Gunn claimed it would expand Medicaid, which he opposes. Reeves largely stayed quiet on the topic during the legislative session. When CNNs Jake Tapper mentioned the failure to pass the extension, along with the states lack of paid maternity leave and poor child health outcomes, Reeves said the root of the states issues is poverty. But his proposed solution didnt include direct assistance or more accessible health care. When you talk about these young ladies, the best thing we can do for them is to provide and improve educational opportunities for them, he said. Despite his claims about the importance of education, Reeves has had at times a contentious relationship with public education officials and advocates. He has not made any serious efforts to fully fund public education. During his tenure as lieutenant governor and governor, the formula that provides the bulk of the states share of funding for local school districts the Mississippi Adequate Education Program has been underfunded more than 2 billion. He also opposed a citizen-sponsored initiative that would have incorporated in the state Constitution more of a commitment to public education. That proposal was narrowly defeated by voters after an intense campaign by Reeves and others. Reeves has advocated for teacher pay raises, but the salary increases that have passed the Legislature have routinely been larger than what he originally proposed. And, of course, he famously filmed his 2019 political ad touting his teacher pay raise proposal at the New Summit private school in Jackson that was later closed during a federal corruption probe. Among other things, the probe accused the schools owners of collecting money from the state for students they did not educate. As for increasing health care access for mothers, Reeves office did not respond when Mississippi Today asked whether he would support postpartum Medicaid extension during the next session. During an April 19 press conference, a reporter asked Reeves about his stance on the issue. He said he had not spoken with the director of the Division of Medicaid about it. Were continuing to look at that and many other topics that exist out there that didnt make it through the legislative process, he said. Well make a decision in the future. Mississippi Republicans have refused to allow debate on expanding Medicaid eligibility for Mississippians, which would provide healthcare coverage for more than 200,000 people at no net cost to the state. In the op-ed this week, Reeves again mentioned plans to increase adoption access in Mississippi. He wrote that the state will extend safe haven laws that allow for mothers to give up children they cant care for, but his office also did not respond to a question about what that would look like in practice. Missisisppis current law allows parents to relinquish an infant up to seven days after birth at a hospital, fire station, adoption agency, or mobile ambulance. Parents are not required to provide any identifying information. Were going to strengthen adoption services and help more children find their forever homes, he wrote. Were going to build grant programs that support mothers in getting the care they need before, during, and after pregnancy. And were going to strengthen our social services infrastructure. The op-ed offered almost no specifics in terms of policy or funding proposals. He wrote that over the last five months, his office has conducted an analysis of our states laws and regulations in order to identify any possible existing rules that might present an obstacle to expectant mothers. His office did not answer a question about what the review had found. As an example of steps his administration is already taking, Reeves cited the 3.5 million tax credit for the states crisis pregnancy centers, which he signed into law in April. Choose Life Mississippi offers grants to about 40 such centers around the state. They aim to dissuade women from getting abortions and generally offer pregnancy tests and ultrasounds as well as baby supplies and parenting classes. Nationally, abortion rights and womens health advocates have criticized the centers as manipulative, focused on getting women in the door to try to stop them from seeking an abortion at any cost. Though many of the centers in Mississippi offer free ultrasounds and medical advice to pregnant people, they are not subject to any regulations from the state department of health. Theyre also not evenly distributed around the state. A map on the Choose Life Mississippi website shows few centers in the Delta and southwest Mississippi, parts of the state that are predominately Black. And the tax credit legislation contains no rules or reporting requirements as to how they spend the money. Reeves and other Republican leaders in the state have repeatedly invoked the centers as a solution for pregnant women, with no mention of other investments in health care or financial support. Weve got to make sure that those expectant mothers, whether they want to be pregnant or not, have access to our pregnancy resource centers, Reeves said during a press conference on May 18. We have 37 of them in Mississippi, situated in every region in our state. Reeves wrote that Roe paved the way for the slaughter of over 60 million children and that abortion is an unthinkable wrong that has wiped out an entire American generation, suggesting that women rarely sought abortions prior to the ruling. But historians say thats not true Abortion has taken place around the world throughout human history. In the 1920s, for example, about 15,000 women died following abortions every year. According to Justice Samuel Alitos draft opinion, Mississippi was late to formally ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy. It did not do so until 1952 half a century after nearly every other state.

Mississippi Today is a proud member of the following organizations 2024 Nonprofit Mississippi News. Powered by Newspack","In his op-ed, Governor Tate Reeves proposes a “new pro-life agenda” for Mississippi, emphasizing the importance of addressing issues beyond abortion. He suggests that the state should strengthen social services, offer grant programs for expectant mothers, and improve the infrastructure to support them, all while Mississippi grapples with significant child well-being issues, such as the highest infant mortality and teen pregnancy rates in the nation.

Reeves stresses that being pro-life means ensuring children born in the state have the best opportunities for success, yet he offers few concrete details or funding plans for these proposed changes. His administration is reportedly working on identifying obstacles to expectant mothers and strengthening adoption services. Reeves also highlights the state’s crisis pregnancy centers, which aim to prevent abortions, although they are criticized for lacking regulation and being unevenly distributed across the state.

Despite these proposals, there is little to no discussion of expanding Medicaid or increasing direct healthcare access for mothers, such as extending postpartum Medicaid coverage—a measure that was blocked in the legislature. Critics argue that Reeves’ broader focus on education and poverty, while important, does not directly address the state’s healthcare challenges for mothers and children.

Overall, the new pro-life agenda emphasizes abortion opposition, but offers vague policy solutions with little detail on funding, execution, or specific commitments. The article highlights the gap between Reeves’ pro-life rhetoric and the state’s existing healthcare and social service challenges, including the lack of concrete action on Medicaid expansion or support for public education."

The fellowship celebrates her dedication to advocating for the pro-life movement, a cause she embraced in eighth grade after hearing a story about her own birth, where her parents defied medical advice against her birth due to concerns about a potential heart abnormality. Her birth was without complications, solidifying her pro-life stance.

Isabella, along with her peers, co-founded Green High School’s Right to Life Club, which now boasts over 20 members. She is praised for her leadership and motivation by Green High School’s social studies teacher, Mark Tomecko, who oversees the club. The fellowship, established in 2010, connects fellows with pro-life mentors and offers them opportunities for leadership development.

Following high school, Isabella plans to attend college and pursue a career in public service, while continuing her advocacy for the unborn.

Claudia Isakov, the first Green student to receive the fellowship, also reflected positively on the program, noting how it helped her build relationships with other passionate pro-life leaders. She will attend the University of Akron, where she intends to continue her pro-life activism through the Students for Life Club and volunteering at pregnancy centers."

Kim Reynolds, but a judge is still considering abortion advocates request to put the restrictions on hold. The new legislation prohibits almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant. Thats a dramatic shift for women in Iowa, where abortion had been legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. Reynolds signed the measure into law in front of 2,000 conservative Christians barely a mile away from where a court hearing for the request to postpone the states new ban took place. The ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed the legal challenge Wednesday and representatives spoke at the court hearing Friday. That hearing ended with the judge saying a decision on whether to put a hold on the new ban may be made next week. District Court Judge Joseph Seidlin said he could not imagine anything that would be more insulting to either side than for him to flippantly rule from the bench Friday. The split screen punctuates a bitter battle between abortion advocates and opponents in Iowa that has dragged on for years and will likely, for now, remain unresolved as the courts assess the laws constitutionality. AP-NORC POLL Few U.S. adults support full abortion bans, even in states that have them As we gather here today, at this very moment, the abortion industry is in the court trying to prevent this law from taking effect and stop once again the will of the people, Reynolds said before bringing people on the stage to sign the law. But the passage of this legislation by even a wider margin this times sends an unmistakable message. The bill passed with exclusively Republican support late on Tuesday at the conclusion of a rare, 14-hour special legislative session. The new measure will be considered in the context of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and Iowas Supreme Court last year, when both reversed themselves on rulings that had affirmed a womans fundamental constitutional right to abortion. Those decisions prompted Reynolds to ask the court to reinstate her blocked 2018 law, which is nearly identical to the new one. The states high court deadlocked last month, prompting Reynolds to call lawmakers back to the Iowa Capitol. Patients lives are deeply impacted every day that this law is allowed to stand, said Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States. Iowans will be harmed as theyve lost the right to control their bodies and futures. Iowans must have the freedom to make the best medical decisions for themselves and their families. We stand at the ready for our patients as we await the Courts decision and are prepared to help them get the reproductive health care they need regardless of the outcome. Planned Parenthood North Central States was planning to refer patients to other states, but remained hopeful there would not be a long interruption in services. As of Wednesday, 200 patients were scheduled for abortions at Iowa Planned Parenthood or the Emma Goldman Clinic this week and next, according to the court filings. Most of them past the six-week mark in their pregnancies. WATCH House approves GOP-led defense bill that adds abortion restrictions, rolls back diversity initiatives One Planned Parenthood clinic stayed open until about 930 p.m. Thursday in an effort to provide abortion care before the new restrictions, their attorney said. I can only hope that all patients who had appointments this morning have gotten the care that they need and that theyre not sitting at a health center right now, the clinics attorney Peter Im said during Fridays court arguments. Iowa lawmakers passed the law in less time than the 24 hour time period thats required for patients to wait before they get an abortion in Iowa, he said, adding that the status quo for the last 50 years has been for abortion pre-viability to be legal in Iowa. This law, which on Tuesday the General Assembly passed in the dead of night after less than a day of deliberation, will violate Iowans constitutional rights and alter that status quo and have devastating consequences for Iowans, he said. There are limited circumstances under the measure that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days incest, if reported within 145 days if the fetus has a fetal abnormality incompatible with life or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman. Most Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre put out an immediate statement saying Iowas newly signed law is an extreme abortion ban that will take away a womans right to choose. While Republican elected officials advance dangerous laws, President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the majority of Americans who believe personal health care decisions should be between a woman and her doctor, not politicians, and will continue to call on Congress to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law, the statement said. Ballentine contributed from Columbia, Missouri. Left Iowa Gov.

Support for NewsHour Provided By","On July 14, 2023, Iowa’s new law banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy took effect. The legislation, signed by Governor Kim Reynolds, prohibits abortions once cardiac activity is detectable, which typically occurs around six weeks—before many women know they are pregnant. This law marks a significant shift from the previous 20-week abortion limit in Iowa. Governor Reynolds signed the law in front of a large audience of conservative Christians, just before a court hearing that could delay its enforcement.

Abortion rights organizations, including the ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States, and the Emma Goldman Clinic, immediately filed a legal challenge, requesting the law be put on hold while the court assesses its constitutionality. The legal battle has been ongoing for years, particularly following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which shifted the authority to regulate abortion back to the states.

The Iowa law includes some exceptions, such as allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest (if reported within specified time limits), if the fetus has a fatal abnormality, or if the pregnancy endangers the woman’s life. However, it has been widely criticized by abortion advocates as a violation of constitutional rights, as it imposes strict limitations before many women are aware of their pregnancies.

Iowa’s law is part of a broader trend across Republican-led states, which have been implementing similar restrictions since the Roe v. Wade decision was overturned. Planned Parenthood and other organizations have expressed concerns about the harm this will cause to Iowans, particularly women who may no longer have access to abortion services within the state. The White House also condemned the law, calling it an extreme measure that undermines women’s rights.

The legal challenge continues, with the outcome uncertain as courts assess the law’s legality."

Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, identifies as a “pro-choice pastor,” a stance Dungy openly challenged. Dungy questioned whether Warnock’s beliefs align with Christianity, especially given biblical passages like Psalm 139:13-16, which emphasize God’s knowledge of life even in the womb. Dungy argued that if God is seen as the creator of life, it should not be within human authority to end it selectively.

The online conversation expanded as various individuals defended Warnock’s stance by emphasizing personal autonomy, while others echoed Dungy’s viewpoint that protecting life aligns with Christian values. Dungy countered arguments supporting abortion rights by drawing moral parallels, comparing the right to life for an unborn child to the right of a born person, and argued that Christian morality shouldn’t vary based on public opinion or convenience.

Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a known pro-life advocate, joined the conversation, critiquing Warnock’s position. She stated that Warnock’s pro-choice stance misguides his congregation and suggested he should offer alternatives to abortion, promoting life-affirming options instead. King emphasized that Warnock, as a pastor, should prioritize life and guide his parishioners away from choices she views as harmful."

This announcement is part of the Action Funds larger rollout of endorsements of federal candidates committed to protecting reproductive health and rights around the country. For the Action Fund and its 13 million members nationwide, winning a reproductive health majority in the U.S. Senate is a top priority. From judicial nominations to abortion access to funding reproductive health programs, Congress makes critical decisions that directly impact Planned Parenthood patients every day. Statement from Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, President and CEO, Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts We are pleased that the Planned Parenthood Action Fund has endorsed Senator Ed Markey. People across Massachusetts want their elected officials to stand up to the Trump administrations attacks on our health, rights, and freedoms, and Senator Markey has been an outspoken and uncompromising champion of reproductive health care and abortion access for nearly four decades. More than 34,000 patients rely on Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care in Massachusetts. Those patients, and everyone in our Commonwealth, need a champion in Congress like Senator Markey to fight for equitable access to care. From his support for the Affordable Care Acts no co-pay birth control benefit to his support for international family planning, Senator Markey has fiercely fought for the health, rights, and dignity of his constituents, as well as people throughout the country and across the globe. Senator Markey has supported reproductive rights and health care in every vote since the Action Fund started tracking this data in 1995. In the last year alone, he co-sponsored every Action Fund priority bill for reproductive health and rights, including the EACH Woman Act, which would lift the discriminatory Hyde Amendment and restore federal insurance coverage of abortion. In addition, Senator Markey has been an outspoken leader in the fight against the Trump Administrations domestic gag rule, which dismantled Title X, the nations only program for affordable birth control, denying health care to millions of people with low incomes. Last year, 26 abortion bans passed in states across the country, forcing people to cross state lines or wait hours or weeks just to access basic health care. In 2018, the American people sent more women, including women of color, to Congress than ever before and flipped the House of Representatives to a clear pro-reproductive health majority. In 2020, there is a clear opportunity to flip the Senate and usher in a full Congress that will protect peoples health and rights.

This endorsement aligns with the Action Fund’s broader goal to support candidates who will protect reproductive health and rights across the U.S. The Fund, representing 13 million members, prioritizes achieving a pro-reproductive health majority in the Senate to influence decisions on issues like judicial nominations, abortion access, and funding for reproductive health programs.

Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, President and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts, praised Senator Markey for his strong stance against policies from the Trump administration that threatened health care and individual freedoms. She highlighted that over 34,000 people in Massachusetts depend on Planned Parenthood for reproductive services, and emphasized the need for a congressional advocate like Markey who supports equitable health care access.

Senator Markey’s record includes consistent support for reproductive rights, voting in favor of related policies since 1995 and co-sponsoring major bills like the EACH Woman Act. This legislation seeks to overturn the Hyde Amendment and ensure federal insurance covers abortion. He has also opposed the domestic gag rule, which weakened Title X, the federal program providing affordable birth control to low-income individuals.

With 26 abortion bans enacted in various states, the endorsement reflects a broader movement to counter restrictive reproductive laws. Planned Parenthood sees the 2020 election as a key opportunity to secure a pro-reproductive health Senate, building on the historic increase in female and minority representation in Congress in 2018."

DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE 430 South Capitol Street Southeast Washington, DC 20003 Proudly Powered by WordPress Democrats FACT SHEET Trumps Anti-Women Record July 27, 2020 facebook twitter email Trump has an abysmal record on issues important to women using the last three and a half years to undermine access to health care, child care, and paid leave. Trump created barriers to full equality and rolled back workplace protections against discrimination and sexual harrassment. Under Trump, it is increasingly difficult for women to succeed in the workplace, at school, and at home. Trump has blocked womens access to health care through legislation, regulations, judicial appointments, and legal action. In 2016, Trump called for an abortion ban with some form of punishment for women which was too extreme even for many anti-abortion activists. Trump tried to limit access to reproductive health care by supporting legislation that would institute a restrictive 20-week abortion ban and block insurance plans that cover abortions. Trump slashed funding for family planning programs and health care providers that provide abortion services or referrals. Trump issued a regulation allowing employers to refuse to provide no-cost contraception coverage as previously required under the Affordable Care Act. After promising to automatically overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump has packed the Supreme Court and circuit courts with extremist opponents of abortion rights. Trump is fighting to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which could allow insurers to charge women more and not cover maternity care. Trump chose the anti-abortion extremist Mike Pence as his running mate and Betsy DeVos, who compared the choice to have an abortion to the choice to own slaves, as his secretary of education. As president he has aggressively touted his anti-abortion agenda, and the president of the Susan B. Anthony List called Trump the most pro-life president in our nations history. Trump revoked protections against sexual harassment, sexual assault, and discrimination at work and school. During the 2016 campaign, Trump said women would make the same as men if they do as good a job. Trump revoked protections against workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault, discrimination, and pay disparities. Trump rescinded Obama-era campus sexual assault guidelines, which required colleges to take allegations more seriously and hold perpetrators accountable, and narrowed the definition of sexual harassment. Trump has failed to reduce the cost of childcare and made little progress on paid family leave. Trump has defended employers who pay mothers less than men and called pregnancy an inconvenience for employers, so its not surprising he has failed to follow through on his promise to solve childcare. Trumps tax scam reduced the value of the childcare credit for low- and moderate-income families even as it gave huge tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest 1. In the midst of a pandemic in which women are disproportionately losing their jobs, Trump scaled back paid leave requirements, leaving 75 of workers at risk of not receiving paid leave for childcare. Trump touted an insufficient paid family leave proposal that does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.","The fact sheet from the Democratic National Committee criticizes former President Donald Trump’s record on women’s issues, highlighting multiple policies and actions that they claim undermine women’s rights, health, and workplace protections.
	1.	Health Care Access and Reproductive Rights: The document states that Trump actively opposed access to reproductive health care. He supported restrictive abortion measures, such as a 20-week abortion ban and limitations on insurance coverage for abortions. Trump’s policies reduced funding for family planning services that included abortion services or referrals and allowed employers to deny contraception coverage, reversing provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Additionally, the document emphasizes that Trump’s judicial appointments included anti-abortion figures who could endanger Roe v. Wade.
	2.	Affordable Care Act (ACA): Trump attempted to dismantle the ACA, potentially affecting women by allowing insurers to charge more and reduce maternity care options. The choice of anti-abortion advocates like Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos in his administration is highlighted as furthering an agenda contrary to women’s health rights.
	3.	Workplace Protections: Trump is criticized for weakening protections against workplace discrimination, sexual harassment, and assault. He revoked Obama-era policies on equal pay and campus sexual assault guidelines, limiting protections and accountability for perpetrators.
	4.	Childcare and Family Leave: The fact sheet points out that Trump failed to address the high costs of childcare and fell short on promises for paid family leave. His administration scaled back paid leave requirements amid the pandemic, leaving many without needed leave benefits. Trump’s tax policies are also said to have reduced the value of childcare credits for lower-income families while favoring corporations and the wealthy.

Overall, the fact sheet argues that Trump’s policies created barriers to women’s success and equality, negatively impacting health care access, economic equality, and safety in workplaces and educational institutions."

All Rights Reserved 2023 Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc. All Rights Reserved","The Kentucky Supreme Court has upheld two restrictive abortion bans, effectively making abortion nearly illegal in the state. This decision allows the enforcement of both a six-week ban and a “trigger ban,” which was designed to go into effect immediately if Roe v. Wade was overturned.

The court’s ruling determined that the abortion providers who challenged the bans did not have “third-party standing” to make constitutional arguments on behalf of their patients regarding the six-week ban. However, the court noted that a different party could potentially raise such constitutional claims in future cases.

The providers did, however, have “first-party standing” to challenge the trigger ban due to financial harm they have experienced, which the court recognized as a valid legal injury. This means they can continue their legal challenge against the trigger ban based on the direct financial impact on their practices.

The court’s decision leaves both restrictive bans in place for now, maintaining an almost complete prohibition on abortion in Kentucky pending further legal proceedings."

WadeThe Supreme Court will review Mississippi abortion law, which bans abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected. Here's how states handle abortion.Just the FAQs, USA TODAYNEW YORK The coronavirus outbreak has fueled attempts to ban abortions in some states, but providers where the procedure remains available report increased demand, often from women distraught over economic stress and health concerns linked to the pandemic.The calls weve been getting are frantic, said Julie Burkhart, who manages clinics in Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City. Weve seen more women coming sooner than they would have because theyre scared they wont be able to access the services later.Some clinics are seeing patients who traveled hundreds of miles from states such as Texas, which has banned abortions during much of the pandemic on grounds they are nonessential.Dr. Allison Cowett of Family Planning Associates in Chicago said one recent patient was a teen who drove from Texas with her mother. In Atlanta, Dr. Marissa Lapedis said her clinic accommodated a woman who received her initial abortion consultation in Texas but flew to Georgia when the Texas ban postponed a second visit to receive the abortion pill.An influx of women from Texas contributed to the upsurge of abortions at Burkharts clinic in Wichita. She said it performed 252 abortions in March, up from 90 in March 2019.Abortions during pandemic Texas clinics ask Supreme Court to allow certain abortions during coronavirus pandemicWorries of making rent, feeding a family, getting health careDr. Jen Villavicencio, an abortion provider in Michigan, predicts that demand for abortions will continue to increase during the pandemic.I hear it in my patients voices and questions daily, she said by email. Theyre worried about how they will make their rent, feed their family, access a ventilator if the need arises.The pandemic has prompted Planned Parenthood, the nationals largest abortion provider, to make adjustments.In New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., Planned Parenthood has modified medication abortion procedures to minimize travel and potential COVID-19 exposure for patients and staff.Dr. Meera Shah is chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, which serves New Yorks northern suburbs. She says her staff is expanding telemedicine as they see an uptick in patients seeking abortions, often convinced that having a child right now isnt best for them.We provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance, Shah said. We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.Dr. Anne Davis, an OB-GYN at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said all services at her hospital are under stress, and COVID-19 patients are numerous. In most cases, her team refers women seeking abortions to non-hospital clinics.She cited one patient who had wanted to be pregnant but requested an abortion when it became clear her medical condition would require multiple hospital visits. Davis said the woman had received comparable treatment during her first pregnancy but decided this time that the hospital wouldnt be as safe.Women are more likely to go through with procedure now, one clinic reportsOne of the biggest challenges in counseling pregnant women is uncertainty, Davis said.We dont know enough about this to say its going to be fine your pregnancy will proceed in usual fashion and there will be no impact from COVID-19, she said. They want us to say it will be all right. We have to say, We dont know.At Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois, close to Saint Louis, deputy director Alison Dreith says women are now less likely to change their minds once they schedule an abortion. Normally, 50 go through with it amid the pandemic, the rate is 85.Hope Clinic staff member Hannah Dismer said one couple decided to terminate a pregnancy they had planned. The wife worried that giving birth at a hospital might expose her to the coronavirus and create risk for the child they have.It hit me really hard that she and her husband had to make that difficult decision, Dismer said.Another concern is that abortion bans will force some women into continuing with high-risk pregnancies.Without services, very sick babies will be born and families forced to watch them suffer who would, in other times, have made a different decision, said Dr. Maryl Sackeim, a Chicago-based OB-GYN.The push for new bans has added urgency to a campaign providing information about relatively safe options for do-it-yourself abortions.Already, many abortions are induced at home with a two-drug combination, under the guidance of a health professional. Advocacy groups say home abortions using one of the drugs misoprostol can be done without professional oversight.Misoprostol is available only by prescription in the U.S. but is available online from some countries where it sells over the counter.Attorney Jill E. Adams, executive director of IfWhenHow, supports that option and urges prosecutors not to target women who use this method.More people will need abortions during this pandemic, she said. Targeting people who end their pregnancies at home is wrong as a matter of law and dangerous as a matter of public health.Amid debate about whether abortion is an essential service, anti-abortion protesters have mobilized outside numerous clinics in some cases triggering confrontations with police over whether theyre violating social-distancing rules. In North Carolina, eight of about 50 protesters were arrested April 4 after refusing to disperse outside a clinic in Charlotte.Even as many businesses close temporarily, anti-abortion pregnancy centers remain open. Virginia-based Care Net, which oversees about 1,100 centers, evoked the pandemic in a fundraising appeal, noting that unplanned pregnancies may rise during isolation, and our centers need to find creative ways to serve these parents and empower them to choose life.Overwhelmed hospitals, equipment shortages Coronavirus pandemic plays out as state planners expectedOn the front lines Health care workers in Ohio are testing positive for COVID-19 at an alarming rate Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices Copyright Gannett 2024","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted abortion access, increasing demand for abortion services and heightening stress among women seeking procedures. Clinics in states where abortion remains legal have reported a surge in calls and patients, many citing economic concerns and fear of health risks related to the pandemic. Providers, especially in places like Kansas, Chicago, and Georgia, have seen an influx of patients from states with stricter abortion laws, such as Texas, which temporarily banned most abortions during the pandemic.

Abortion providers like Dr. Meera Shah of Planned Parenthood have adapted to the increased demand by expanding telemedicine services, offering medication abortions, and ensuring minimal patient exposure to COVID-19. In some cases, women have traveled long distances for abortion care after services were delayed or restricted in their home states.

Women are increasingly likely to go through with abortions once scheduled, as uncertainty surrounding the pandemic adds to their concerns about bringing a child into the world. Some patients, including a mother who decided against giving birth at a hospital, have cited fears of COVID-19 exposure during childbirth. There is also growing concern about the impact of abortion bans, particularly in cases involving high-risk pregnancies.

Amid these challenges, there is a push for greater access to home abortions, using misoprostol, a drug that can be used to induce abortions under medical guidance. Advocates argue that such methods, though available by prescription in the U.S., are safer than forcing women to continue with unwanted pregnancies.

Despite the demand for abortion services, anti-abortion groups continue to protest outside clinics, sometimes clashing with authorities over social distancing violations. Meanwhile, some anti-abortion centers remain open during the pandemic, using the crisis to appeal for donations.

Overall, the pandemic has heightened the complexity of accessing abortion services, leading to an increase in demand, changes in how abortions are provided, and debates around abortion as an essential service."

Critics were in doubt. They thought no group could draw a crowd as large surrounding such a ""controversial"" issue. ""Everybody said women wouldn't march for abortion rights,"" Feminist Majority President Eleanor Smeal, who helped organise and speak at the march, told The Independent. ""We said, 'Oh yes they will'.""""We wanted to make sure that people understood the overwhelming popularity of this issue, and we wanted it to be big,"" she added. The Feminist Majority was joined with six other feminist and civil rights organisations to organise and guide the march National Organisation for Women NOW, American Civil Liberties Union, Black Women's Health Imperative, NARAL Pro Choice America, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and Planned Parenthood. Toni Van Pelt, current NOW president and organiser of the March for Women's Lives on 25 April, 2004 explained to The Independent that the political environment helped spark the need for a protest.""There was so much government interference and we had no government support for the terrorism that was going on in the reproductive clinics,"" she said. ""We were marching for the right to abortion, birth control, and all reproductive options, including the right to have children and determine when we were going to have families.""That was really important to us.""

""We didn't know it was going to hit over a million. No one could've predicted that,"" Ms Smeal said. ""But we thought we would break all standards, and we did."" BREAKING RECORDSThe March for Women's Lives became the largest march Washington had ever seen. But then the 2017 Women's March, just one day after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, broke all records by boasting a crowd of an estimated 3.2m to 5.2m fighting for women's rights. RecommendedTrump's coronavirus response to be probed by new House watchdog panelSNL at home returns with second remote episodeRicky Gervais says people are mistaken about his jokesCoronavirus revealed who Trump really is. So why is Biden in trouble?Making the 2004 march all the more exciting was the celebrities who also descended on Washington to support the movement. Stars like Susan Sarandon, Whoopi Goldberg, Ashley Judd, and Julianne Moore all attended. Speaker after speaker appeared on one of two stages set up during the march to speak to the crowd about how imperative it was to advocate for women's reproductive rights. ""We are here to take back our country,"" American feminist and political activist Gloria Steinem shouted into the crowd. Signs rooting for presumed Democratic candidate John Kerry were pictured during the march, showing who some activists supported. President George W Bush would later defeat Mr Kerry in the 2004 election. Prominent Democratic leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton were also in attendance. ""We didn't have to march for 12 long years because we had a government that respected the rights of women,"" Mrs Clinton said, according to The New York Times. ""The only way we're going to be able to avoid having to march again and again and again is to elect John Kerry president.""What the senator didn't know then was that her words would hold more impact 16 years after the monumental march. In 2020, America is once again in an election year with a Republican president vying for a second term, all while putting judges in place who vowed to dismantle reproductive and abortion rights across the country. Now more than ever laws like Roe v Wade were at risk despite the pro-choice movement growing in force within the last 16 years. ""They're trying, they're trying,"" Ms Smeal said about the Republican opposition. ""They're trying to stack the courts and they are stacking the courts. Not just the Supreme Court, but the lower courts.""""It's very unpopular. The backlash will be severe,"" she added. LEGAL CHALLENGEAbout 57 per cent of Americans label themselves as ""pro-choice"", a number that has grown since 2004, compared to 35 per cent who define themselves as ""pro-life"", according to a 2019 NPRPBS NewsHourMarist poll. When divided among parties, 74 per cent of Democrats, 60 per cent of Independents, and 29 per cent of Republicans consider themselves ""pro-choice"". Despite the pro-choice movement winning the majority of American support, the opposition has pushed momentum towards decreasing access to abortion and reproductive services. And the coronavirus has only helped this movement with governors in Texas and Alabama, to name a few, attempting to block abortion services by listing them as non-essential, elective surgeries during the pandemic. ""They're driving people out that want to perform these services for these women,"" Ms Pelt said, adding the virus ban was ""egregious"" and ""attacking all these different angles"" when targeting clinics and their doctors. The US Centre for Reproductive Rights issued an emergency lawsuit against five states during the pandemic to ensure clinics could perform their abortion services. In Alabama, US district judge Myron Thompson issued a preliminary injunction on Sunday to prevent the state from forbidding abortions as part of the elective medical procedures ban during Covid-19. The decision would now be up to individual clinics on if they want to halt performing the procedure. RecommendedPrince William jokes he hasnt seen Tiger King during Big Night InTrump allies rebuked by colleagues for not wearing masksTrump adviser Kudlow says businesses shouldn't for employee infectionsCoronavirus Up to 1.6m New Yorkers may already have been infectedWhile the ruling was a victory for abortion-rights activists, the fight remains in other states like Texas and Ohio. Another fight in Alabama could land on the doorsteps of the US Supreme Court and put 1973 Roe v Wade at risk, one of the most landmark court rulings that protects a pregnant woman's right to an abortion without excessive government restrictions. Alabama passed a law in 2019 that was almost a near-total ban on abortions in the state and was expected to go into effect in November before a federal judge blocked it. Judge Myron H. Thompson wrote the law violated the Supreme Court's ruling and ""defies"" the constitution. But activists expected the opposition to push back. ""We think that this case will go to the Supreme Court,"" Ms Pelt warned. ""This might be the one to try to overturn Roe v Wade.""CONSOLIDATING SUPPORTPeople could argue another March for Women's Lives might be needed more than ever 16 years after the last one, as the right to abortion nears what would be another monumental Supreme Court decision. ""A lot of Women's March events that got to be really massive and public took place at moments like this one, where everyone expected the Supreme Court to roll back abortion rights,"" Mary Ziegler, legal historian and author of Abortion and The Law in America, told The Independent. RecommendedPlacards, protests, and pink hats History of the Women's March""It's been a way of bringing people into the Women's March and probably into the women's movement, because of the unique visibility of the abortion issue,"" she added. Despite the fight from the pro-life movement, the political and social landscape for America has greatly changed since the last March for Women's lives. ""In 2004, not only was Bush in, but we were having trouble with both parties,"" Ms Smeal said. ""Now it's 2020 and we have the nominee for the Democratic Party pro-choice. We just have to do something with the other party."" ""You never hear anybody saying, 'The women's vote is not affected by the abortion vote.' Everybody knows that it is very, very strongly held,"" she added. Medical abortions, which occurs when pills are used to aid an abortion, and over-the-counter emergency contraception without prescriptions are also now additions to women's reproductive services. But the ""fight"", as Ms Smeal put it, still goes on for the movement. ""We'll win,"" she said. In case the movement experienced legislative setbacks, though, activist organisations were prepared to provide access to abortion services for all women that were safe, legally or not.

The march was organized by feminist and civil rights groups like the Feminist Majority, NOW, ACLU, and Planned Parenthood, in response to increased government interference with reproductive rights and violence against clinics.

Despite critics who doubted the turnout, the march was a massive success, with notable celebrity participation and speeches from feminist leaders like Gloria Steinem. The event not only advocated for abortion rights but also broader reproductive freedoms, such as birth control and the right to choose when to have children. In 2004, there was widespread concern about the Bush administration’s stance on these issues, with figures like Hillary Clinton stressing the importance of electing a pro-choice president. However, the issue has since remained contentious, and in 2020, abortion rights faced renewed challenges, particularly with the potential for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The article also highlights that public support for abortion rights has increased over time, with about 57% of Americans identifying as “pro-choice” by 2019. Despite this, the pro-life movement has made significant gains, particularly in pushing for legal restrictions on abortion, such as in Alabama, where nearly all abortion services were banned. Activists are preparing for further legal challenges, with some states, including Texas, attempting to restrict abortion access under the guise of non-essential medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite these setbacks, the pro-choice movement remains resilient. Organizers are committed to ensuring safe, legal, and accessible abortion services regardless of the law. The article concludes with a sense of hope, with activists declaring, “We will win,” emphasizing their preparedness to provide access to reproductive healthcare even in the face of legal opposition."

I discovered I was pregnant after taking a pregnancy test following a missed period, and surely enough the test confirmed I was carrying. When I saw the positive pregnancy test result, I immediately knew what I had to do. There was no way I could sustain another life when I didn't even have a complete grip on my own. I was still living at home and just starting my college journey, and I didn't really have a relationship with the person who impregnated me, so I chose to get an abortion.At the time I told no one, except a friend who had once gotten an abortion herself. I was afraid of what other people would think of my choice, but my friend really guided me through the process. She referred me to Planned Parenthood and within a week of finding out I was pregnant, I went into the clinic and terminated my pregnancy.COURTESY OF CASSY JONES-MCBRYDENow, about two decades later, I work at Planned Parenthood. It wasn't something I planned, but I consider it to be a case of serendipity. In my role as the first Black Organizing Program Coordinator for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, I lead organizing efforts and advocacy work centered around the black community and their limited access to reproductive health services. I've only been in the role for less than a year, but my familiarity with the nonprofit goes way back. When I had my abortion, the people at Planned Parenthood could not have been more supportive. They reaffirmed the idea that I was the only one who had the power to decide what was right for me. The day I went in, there were about three or four women across the street holding up signs pushing anti-abortion rhetoric. The signs were graphic images of bloody embryos, but I wasnt fazed by them since I often passed the clinic on my way to school and was already used to seeing the disturbing signs. When I went into the doctors office, it honestly felt like I was at a gynecologists office getting a pap smear. I felt some slight discomfort during the abortion procedure, but it all happened so quickly, much more quickly than I had imagined it would. What I choose to do with my body should be only up to me.After getting the abortion, the one emotion I felt was relieved. The week in between finding out I was pregnant and terminating the pregnancy was difficult. I wasnt conflicted about my choice, but rather the perceptions of what others would have of me. My mother had so much hope for my future and my family didnt even know I was sexually active. Sex was just something we didnt discuss, and though I know they would have been supportive, I didnt want them to feel like I had compromised or limited my future. But if there was one thing I could change about my personal process, it's that I wish I would have told family sooner, instead of worrying what others would think due to the negative stigmas surrounding abortion. I first came to Planned Parenthood in 2019 as a volunteer, more than 20 years after I had my abortion.I was trying to infiltrate different spaces in Detroit to advocate for plus-sized women. In fact, I had founded my own nonprofit called the International Fuller Women Network, which focuses on body positive messaging and connecting plus-sized women to resources that help them celebrate who they are through activities like fashion shows, forums, and peer support groups. Plus-sized women face unfair disadvantages when it comes to reproductive health. For example, there are forms of birth control that are less effective if youre over a certain body mass index percentage and the morning after pill becomes less effective the more you weigh. I wanted to influence policy in my community, so I became a fellow for the Economic Justice Alliance of Michigan, an organization working towards improving the quality of life for working class and low-income communities. It was through them that I first connected with the Planned Parenthood here in Michigan. I knew that getting involved with Planned Parenthood would allow me to effect change in Detroit's health system.Courtesy of CASSY JONES-MCBRYDEMy goal has always been to help people in the Black and plus-sized communities of Detroit and Planned Parenthood gave me an avenue to do that. Through my volunteer work, I'm able to connect with women, especially Black women, who need support from someone who looks like them. I lead sessions on how to use and access health services and how to advocate for yourself, and have shared my story in the hopes of destigmatizing abortion and sexual reproductive health. In order to prepare to tell my story publicly for the first time, I underwent training with other women who are in Planned Parenthoods' Speakers Bureau. Hearing their stories was so inspiring that it made me realize my own story had value too. So when it was my turn to speak in front of an audience for the first time, I didn't really feel nervous. Instead, I felt like I was finally ready.It was actually preparing to share my story publicly that motivated me to open up to my sisters about my abortion, even though I was still nervous to have those conversations. I didnt know what they would think, since it had been over two decades since my abortion. I first opened up to my sister a day before speaking in front of a legislative panel at the State Capitol in Michigan. She was so supportive, and asked why I hadn't opened up sooner. Shortly after, I also opened up to my other sister. I know that if I had told my sisters about my abortion in real time, back when I was in college, that they would have been supportive back then too. But at the time, I didn't want to burden them with thoughts of how they could possibly help me.Unfortunately, I wasnt able to tell my mom about my abortion before she passed, but I feel that she is present in my advocacy work. Shortly after I spoke at the State Capitol in Michigan, a Black woman came up to me and hugged me without saying a word. She didnt know that I needed that, and in that moment, I really felt like that was my mom, like it was a sign that she was present in that space. Courtesy of CASSY JONES-MCBRYDE Right now, the freedom to do what we want with our bodies is under attack. The stakes are really high this election year, especially in regards to reproductive healthcare access. This administration has tried to undermine democracy, deny access to healthcare, and take away reproductive health resources, like abortion, which usually harms the most vulnerable. People of color, LGBTQ, rural communities, plus-sized people, and people in poverty have all been the targets of this administration. So Im eager to vote for someone that will vote for my interests and that won't be Donald Trump. Locally, Im really looking forward to voting for United States Senator from the state of Michigan, Gary Peters, whos running to keep his role in the Senate. Senator Peters has been a champion for fighting to protect and expand our public health and infrastructure, especially in the face of COVID-19. He has also been an advocate for increasing access to reproductive health services, which is why hes been endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and he isn't all talk. Peters is actually co-sponsoring the Momnibus Bill, which attempts to address maternal health in Black women, who are affected by disproportionate mortality rates from childbirth-related complications. But most importantly, his ideologies dont intrude on mine. What I choose to do with my body should be only up to me and not influenced by a politician's view of what they think I should do. This why we need politicians who will fight to protect and expand access to sexual health services, including abortion. Protecting our right to choose is time-sensitive. I feel an urgency Ive never felt before to advocate for my community and thats why Ill be eagerly heading to the polls this November.Watch Next Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowLifePresented by United HealthcareHow To Avoid Unexpected Health BillsFixer Upper The Lakehouse Is Coming in JuneCostco Sells the Coziest Tiny Home We've Ever SeenHow Yesterday's Kate Pic Was Taken.AhemAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAll The Pregnant Celebrities With 2024 Due Dates'The Bachelor' 2024 Spoilers For Joey GraziadeiFans React to ""Offensive"" Christina Hall RumorWhat the Metadata on the Kate Photo RevealsHow Debbie Allen, 74, Balances 'Grey's Anatomy'Who Is Sutton's Ex-Husband, Christian Stracke?Amazon Vacuum Sale March 2024 Up To 86 OffWhere Are Your Fave Love Is Blind Couples Now?Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Women's HealthNewsletterCustomer CareAdvertiseMedia KitOther Hearst SubscriptionsSubscribeGive a GiftA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.2024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

At the age of 19, when she discovered she was pregnant, Jones-McBryde felt compelled to terminate the pregnancy as she wasn’t ready to become a mother and was just beginning her college journey. She sought help from a friend who had gone through an abortion herself and was referred to Planned Parenthood, where she received the care and support she needed. Despite the stigma and anti-abortion protests outside the clinic, she felt relief after the procedure, knowing she had control over her own body.

Two decades later, Jones-McBryde works for Planned Parenthood as the first Black Organizing Program Coordinator for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, focusing on advocating for the Black community’s access to reproductive health services. She reflects on the challenges of not opening up to her family about her abortion at the time, especially her mother, who passed away before she could share this part of her life. However, she found support and strength from her sisters and others in the community, which motivated her to speak publicly about her experience to help destigmatize abortion.

Jones-McBryde emphasizes the importance of protecting reproductive rights, especially during a time when they are under threat. She expresses her support for politicians, like Michigan Senator Gary Peters, who champion reproductive health and access to services, including abortion. She believes it’s crucial to vote for leaders who protect bodily autonomy and reproductive rights, urging people to vote in the upcoming election to safeguard these freedoms, especially for vulnerable communities."
A Brief History of Abortion in the U.S. | Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health Magazine,"A Brief History of Abortion in the U.S. Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health Magazine Skip to main content Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health Magazine Main navigation Menu Articles Archives Search A Brief History of Abortion in the U.S. Abortion wasnt always a moral, political, and legal tinderbox. What changed? By Annalies Winny Abortion laws have never been more contentious in the U.S. Yet for the first century of the countrys existenceand most of human history before thatabortion was a relatively uncontroversial fact of life. Abortion has existed for pretty much as long as human beings have existed, says Joanne Rosen, JD, MA, a senior lecturer in Health Policy and Management who studies the impact of law and policy on access to abortion. Until the mid-19th century, the U.S. attitude toward abortion was much the same as it had often been elsewhere throughout history It was a quiet reality, legal until quickening when fetal motion could be felt by the mother. In the eyes of the law, the fetus wasnt a separate distinct entity until then, but rather an extension of the mother, Rosen explains. What changed? Americas first anti-abortion movement wasnt driven primarily by moral or religious concerns like it is today. Instead, abortions first major foe in the U.S. was physicians on a mission to regulate medicine. Until this point, abortion services had been womens work. Most providers were midwives, many of whom made a good living selling abortifacient plants. They relied on methods passed down through generations, from herbal abortifacients and pessariesa tampon-like device soaked in a solution to induce abortionto catheter abortions that irritate the womb and force a miscarriage, to a minor surgical procedure called dilation and curettage DC, which remains one of the most common methods of terminating an early pregnancy. The cottage abortion industry caught the attention of the fledgling American Medical Association, which was established in 1847 and, at the time, excluded women and Black people from membership. The AMA was keen to be taken seriously as a gatekeeper of the medical profession, and abortion services made midwives and other irregular practitionersso-called quacksan easy target. Their rhetoric was strategic, says Mary Fissell, PhD, the J. Mario Molina professor in the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University. You have to link those midwives to providing abortion as a way of kind of getting them out of business, Fissell says. So organized medicine very much takes the anti-abortion position and stays with that for some time. Early 19th century and before Abortion is legal in the U.S. until quickening 1857 AMA campaigns to end abortion 186080 At least 40 anti-abortion statutes are enacted in the U.S. 1873 Comstock Act makes it illegal to sell or mail contraceptives or abortifacients Late 19th century OB-GYN emerges as a specialty 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut decision finds that the Constitution guarantees a right to privacy, specifically in prescribing contraceptives, paving the way for Roe v. Wade 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade enshrines abortion as a constitutional right 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey protects a woman's right to have an abortion prior to fetal viability 200507 Four states pass trigger laws making it a felony to perform, procure, or prescribe an abortion if Roe is ever overturned June 2022 Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey overturned 13 states ban abortion by October 2022 - In 1857, the AMA took aim at unregulated abortion providers with a letter-writing campaign pushing state lawmakers to ban the practice. To make their case, they asserted that there was a medical consensus that life begins at conception, rather than at quickening. The campaign succeeded. At least 40 anti-abortion laws went on the books between 1860 and 1880. And yet some doctors continued to perform abortions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By then, abortion was illegal in almost all states and territories, but during the Depression era, doctors could see why women wouldnt want a child, and many would perform them anyway, Fissell says. In the 1920s and through the 1930s, many cities had physicians who specialized in abortions, and other doctors would refer patients to them off book. That leniency faded with the end of World War II. All across America, its very much about gender roles, and women are supposed to be in the home, having babies, Fissell says. This shift in the 1940s and 50s meant that more doctors were prosecuted for performing abortions, which drove the practice underground and into less skilled hands. In the 1950s and 1960s, up to 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed each year in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute. In 1965, 17 of reported deaths attributed to pregnancy and childbirth were associated with illegal abortion. A rubella outbreak from 19631965 moved the dial again, back toward more liberal abortion laws. Catching rubella during pregnancy could cause severe birth defects, leading medical authorities to endorse therapeutic abortions. But these safe, legal abortions remained largely the preserve of the privileged. Women who are well-to-do have always managed to get abortions, almost always without a penalty, says Fissell. But God help her if she was a single, Black, working-class woman. Women who could afford it brought their cases to court to fight for access to hospital abortions. Other women gained approval for abortions with proof from a physician that carrying the pregnancy would endanger her life or her physical or mental health. These cases set off a wave of abortion reform bills in state legislatures that helped set the stage for Roe v. Wade. By the time Roe was decided in 1973, legal abortions were already available in 17 statesand not just to save a womans life. But raising the issue to the level of the Supreme Court and enshrining abortion rights for all Americans also galvanized opposition to it and mobilized anti-abortion groups. Roe was under attack virtually from the moment it was decided, says Rosen. In 1992 another Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey posed the most significant existential threat to Roe. Rosen calls it the case that launched a thousand abortion regulations, upholding Roe but giving states far greater scope to regulate abortion prior to fetal viability. However, defining that nebulous milestone a became a flashpoint for debate as medical advancements saw babies survive earlier and earlier outside the womb. Sonograms became routine around the same time, making fetal life easier to grasp and putting wind in the sails of the pro-life movement, Rosen says. Then in June, the Supreme Court overturned both Roe and Casey. For many Americans, that meant the return to the conundrum that led Norma McCorveya.k.a. Jane Roeto the Supreme Court in 1971 being poor and pregnant, and seeking an abortion in a state that had banned them in all but the narrowest of circumstances. The history of abortion in the U.S. suggests the tides will turn again. We often see periods of toleration followed by periods of repression, says Fissell. The current moment is unequivocally marked by the latter. What remains to be seen is how long it will last. Image at top Chichesters English Diamond Brand Pennyroyal Pills. PR 031 Bella C.

Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205","The history of abortion in the U.S. has evolved significantly, shifting from a generally uncontroversial practice to one marked by intense moral, political, and legal disputes. For the first century of the country’s existence, abortion was largely legal until “quickening” (when fetal movement was felt), with abortion providers primarily being midwives who used methods passed down through generations. However, this began to change in the mid-19th century due to a push by the newly established American Medical Association (AMA) to regulate medicine and establish the legitimacy of physicians over midwives and other unregulated practitioners. The AMA targeted abortion providers, framing abortion as dangerous and promoting the belief that life begins at conception, which helped lead to the passage of anti-abortion laws in the late 19th century.

Despite these laws, abortions were still performed secretly by some doctors, especially during the Great Depression when some understood the financial and personal difficulties women faced in unwanted pregnancies. After World War II, however, there was a societal shift toward reinforcing traditional gender roles, leading to stricter enforcement and the criminalization of abortion, which pushed the practice underground, often into the hands of less qualified individuals.

By the 1960s, illegal abortions reached up to 1.2 million annually, contributing to unsafe conditions, with many women dying from unsafe procedures. The medical community responded by supporting legal therapeutic abortions, especially after the rubella outbreak of 1963-65, which could cause birth defects. At the same time, legal battles for abortion access began, particularly among privileged women, eventually leading to significant reforms.

The 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, though it was met with fierce opposition, giving rise to anti-abortion movements. In 1992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed Roe but allowed states more leeway in regulating abortions, which led to increased restrictions. Technological advances like sonograms made the fetus appear more “human,” galvanizing the pro-life movement. The Supreme Court eventually overturned both Roe and Casey in June 2022, leading to a resurgence of state-level abortion bans, particularly affecting poorer and minority women.

The article concludes by noting the cyclical nature of abortion rights in U.S. history, characterized by alternating periods of tolerance and repression, suggesting that the current restrictive phase may not last indefinitely."

Retweeting a Breitbart article on the matter, the rapper used the phrase Get rid of it again, accompanied by stick figures and emojis depicting playfulness and embarrassment.This is not the first time that Hill has clashed with conservatives. In June, the rapper accused Fox News host Tucker Carlson of lying by telling millions of people on national television that I was inciting riots.Carlson listed Hill as one of several celebrities that donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which was providing bail to rioters and led to the release of violent offenders and even a child rapist. While the fund has raised over 3,475,000 only 210,000 has gone to pay people's bail. The Fox News segment came as protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, engulfed cities across the U.S. Many of these protests often turned into violent riots, looting, and arson that destroyed 400 local businesses and is expected to cost over 500 million to rebuild. Following the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the most liberal members of the court, TMZ caught up with Hill and asked him what he thought a replacement for Ginsburg, who would be appointed by President Donald Trump, ""could mean for his rights as a member of the LGBTQ community."" Its terrifying, replied Hill, who is openly gay.Its scary. We have to get out and vote, he added. When asked if he had a message for his followers and fans, Hill urged them to get out and vote and use your voice. He declined to comment, motioning that his lips were zipped, when the TMZ reporter inquired as to whether he had a message for Trump, who had yet to announce Amy Coney Barrett as his designated replacement for Ginsburg.Just last month, Hill got into an exchange with Angela Stanton King, a former Republican congressional candidate, who tweeted out her concerns with a promo image for his song Holiday. The image featured a picture of Hill about to make out with a clone of himself.So this is what black culture is pushing to our youth now? King asked.

The comment, which pro-life groups criticized as insensitive and promoting abortion, led to a backlash. Lil Nas X responded by clarifying that the pregnant fan was joking and that his comment was intended as a joke as well. Despite the criticism, including from the pro-life group Live Action, the rapper remained unrepentant, continuing to use the phrase humorously in a retweet.

Live Action, led by Lila Rose, condemned the joke, calling it misogynistic and harmful, especially given the rapper’s large following. They accused him of encouraging abortion and promoting violence against the unborn. Lil Nas X, however, dismissed the backlash and expressed frustration over the attention his comments had received.

This incident is not the first time Lil Nas X has attracted controversy. He previously clashed with conservative figures, including a dispute with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and has been vocal about political issues, particularly regarding LGBTQ rights and the potential impact of Supreme Court decisions.

One had an alleged altercation last year with an abortion facility escort he said was harassing his young son. The other father allegedly assisted a group of pro-lifers praying and singing hymns outside an abortion business more than a year ago. Peter Breen, vice president and senior counsel at the Thomas More Society, told the Register that these incidents point to a weaponized Department of Justice that is seeking to intimidate pro-life people and people of faith in this country, and they should outrage every American, no matter where they stand on abortion. The charges against Mark Houck, a 48-year-old Catholic father of seven, stem from an incident that took place on Oct. 13, 2021, in which a 72-year-old facility escort, Bruce Love, approached Houck and his son, who were peacefully praying about 50 feet from the center, Breen said. According to Breen, the escort made crude references, sexual and otherwise, to Houcks 12-year-old son. An altercation ensued in which Houck allegedly shoved Love. Breen said the Philadelphia District Attorneys Office declined to prosecute the incident, so Love filed a private criminal complaint, which was dismissed when Love repeatedly failed to show up in court. However, Houck was informed weeks later that federal prosecutors were investigating and that the U.S. Attorneys Office wanted to speak to his attorney. A Thomas More Society attorney advised the U.S. Attorneys Office in a June email, Breen said, that, based on relevant case law in the same district, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances FACE Act that Houck was facing charges under doesnt apply to one-off altercations unrelated to abortion access. The attorneys also agreed to bring Houck in wherever they want him to be brought in and whatever date and time is appropriate. Breen said they received no reply until they were notified that Houck had been taken into custody on Sept. 23. He said the agents had long guns pointed at Mark and his family, they came and pounded on his door, and one gunman was pointing a gun inside the house. Added Breen, His wife is there, looking on, along with his seven children at the top of the staircase. Shes holding them back. Houcks wife, Ryan-Marie Houck, demanded to see a warrant, which the agents initially refused to provide, but did provide one to her. A SWAT team of about 25 came to my house with about 15 vehicles and started pounding on our door, she told Catholic News Agency following the incident. The FBIs Philadelphia office challenged her account, telling Catholic News Agency in a statement that no SWAT Team or SWAT operators were involved. FBI agents knocked on Mr. Houcks front door, identified themselves as FBI agents, and asked him to exit the residence. He did so and was taken into custody without incident pursuant to an indictment. However, an FBI spokesman declined to answer Catholic News Agencys questions about the number of law enforcement personnel at the scene and whether any drew their weapons and pointed them at the family. DOJ Media Spin We found out on the day of the arrest that the Department of Justice was running the media operation out of Washington, D.C., not out of the local U.S. Attorney's Office, Breen said, and we learned that a senior trial attorney from the Department of Justice had actually been running point on this case from the beginning. In its press release regarding the arrest, the DOJ stated that there were two separate incidents involving Houck and Bruce Love referred to as B.L. in the first incident, B.L. was attempting to escort two patients exiting the clinic, when the defendant forcefully shoved B.L. to the ground. In the second incident, the defendant verbally confronted B.L. and forcefully shoved B.L. to the ground in front of the Planned Parenthood center, causing injuries to B.L. that required medical attention. Breen said that the first allegation appears to be fabricated and without evidence. He pointed out that in Loves private criminal complaint, he only alleged one incident of physical contact, not two. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, along with 10 of his colleagues in the Senate, wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Sept. 28 with a series of questions, including, In light of Mr. Houcks alleged cooperation with federal authorities, what factors led to the Justice Department and FBI executing an arrest warrant against him instead of using less aggressive tactics, including a summons to appear? The U.S. senators wrote that the extraordinary fact pattern in Houcks arrest requires additional information from the Justice Department and the FBI relating to why Mr. Houck was not allowed to self-report for his arrest and arraignment and whether political considerations were made to approve and execute the search warrant. A Second FBI Raid Another home arrest occurred just weeks after Houcks, at the home of pro-life leader Paul Vaughn, a father of 11, who recorded a video of fellow pro-life advocates singing and praying outside a Tennessee abortion facility in March 2021. According to the Thomas More Society, he was never arrested by the local police and was recording the protest and serving as a liaison between life advocates and the police to ensure the safety of all involved. Others involved in the protest were arrested for blocking the doors to the abortion facility they were arrested at the time of the blockade. Yet Vaughn had FBI agents appear at his house more than a year later to arrest him as he was preparing to take his children to school. His children were outside, Breen said. He sees a federal agent with a long gun holding his children back, preventing them from moving, and then he is taken into custody. He also referenced a video, taken by Vaughns wife, showing the agents refusing to explain what happened and why they had to come out with guns against him. This idea, that the Department of Justice is now going to come out with big guns against peaceful, pro-life people, is becoming a pattern, he said. There are children involved, and theyre affecting unnecessary arrests with overwhelming force. He said, in the Vaughn case, they didnt just charge him with a FACE violation they are charging them the group of pro-lifers with a violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act, the conspiracy to violate civil rights. A first violation of the FACE Act is supposed to carry a six-month maximum sentence. Its a misdemeanor at the federal level. By contrast, the KKK Act has a 10-year penalty in the federal penitentiary. Theyre at risk to go to federal prison longer than many violent criminals, merely for coming together and sitting and singing hymns and prayers in front of an abortion clinic door. Breen added that, subsequent to Roe v. Wade being overturned in June, abortion is not legal in Tennessee anymore, so why would you even charge these people when that abortion clinic isnt even doing abortions anymore? History of FACE Both men are facing charges under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances FACE Act of 1994, a law prohibiting by force, by threat of force, or by physical obstruction attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person is obtaining or providing reproductive health services. It also prohibits force and threats against places of worship. Catherine Short, chief legal officer at the Life Legal Defense Foundation, told the Register that the FACE Act was passed in the early days of the Clinton administration to address the pro-life organization Operation Rescue by enacting some really stiff federal penalties on clinic blockades that were organized and massive and did tend to go across state lines in a lot of smaller states. However, Short said that, by the time the act was signed in 1994, most organized blockades were discontinued. She said what made the measure first of its kind was that a peaceful blockade could bring in federal felony charges. She said the measure has been used primarily against violence or threats of violence, even though when you rise to the level of violence and threats of violence, the local authorities are perfectly willing to act in that situation, using local criminal-assault laws. Breen pointed out that the Obama administration targeted peaceful pro-life sidewalk counselors under the FACE Act, filing civil injunction lawsuits against peaceful sidewalk counselors and prayer-vigil participants, because they reasoned that handing out literature and talking to people meant obstructing other peoples access to the abortion clinics. The Obama administrations reasoning was rejected by federal judges, including in a case Breen led in Colorado, where pro-lifer Ken Scott faced a 10,000 fine and 10 charges under FACE. The judge ruled in 2012 that the brief discussions Scott had with people handing them leaflets were not unreasonable delays. In another case that took place in Florida, a federal judge ordered the Obama DOJ to pay 120,000 to pro-life sidewalk counselor Mary Susan Pine, who had FACE charges brought against her after counseling someone through their car window. No proof was provided in that case that Pine had obstructed anyones access to the business. Ultimately, Breen said, the administration backed down, and we really didnt have much problem under the FACE Act with the Obama administration in their second term. He is hopeful that similar legal victories will occur for the pro-lifers currently facing charges. Selective Enforcement Katie Glenn, state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told the Register that the FACE Act has a corollary piece that would protect churches and pregnancy centers from the violence theyve been facing. She said, We see that Merrick Garland and the Justice Department are not interested in enforcing the law in that way, even though we know dozens of churches and pregnancy centers have been vandalized and attacked in the last few months, so this is certainly being applied very selectively by the Biden administration to go after people that they perceive as going against their agenda. Short said it is striking that the Biden administration hasnt appeared to make a single arrest related to the vandalism and arson attacks that have occurred at pro-life facilities since the U.S. Supreme Courts Dobbs decision overturned Roe, noting that arson in general has a very low level for the federal government to get involved. She pointed out that the activist group Janes Revenge has claimed credit for some of these attacks. U.S. Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mike Johnson, R-La., recently announced that they were launching a congressional inquiry into the Justice Departments enforcement of the FACE Act. In a letter to Jacqueline Romero, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, they wrote that the Department of Justice has almost exclusively enforced the FACE Act to protect pro-abortion activists while failing to prosecute harassment and intimidation of pro-life supporters. They noted that FACE protects pro-life pregnancy counseling services and any other pregnancy support facility providing reproductive health care. The congressmen cited examples, including the fact that, since the leak of the draft Dobbs opinion, Janes Revenge, a radical anti-life group, has claimed responsibility for at least 18 arson and vandalism attacks on pro-life clinics and organizations. While the FBI says that it is investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics, to our knowledge, the Department and FBI have not executed any SWAT team dawn raids to make arrests of anti-life activists. Glenn said that the Biden administration is sending a message with their enforcement of FACE and the raids at family homes. When you arrest people in that way, they are definitely doing that intentionally, and its because they want people to be afraid to sidewalk counsel.

Sign Up","Legal experts are raising concerns about the aggressive tactics used by the Biden administration’s Department of Justice (DOJ) to target pro-life demonstrators, particularly in light of recent FBI raids on pro-life families. The cases of two fathers, Mark Houck and Paul Vaughn, have sparked outcry. Both men were arrested at their homes in front of their families, with armed agents executing raids, raising questions about the necessity of such force.

Mark Houck, a Catholic father of seven, was charged under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, following an altercation in October 2021 with an abortion clinic escort who allegedly made inappropriate comments to Houck’s son. Despite the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office not pursuing charges, federal prosecutors moved forward with the case, leading to Houck’s arrest in September 2022. His family was present when armed agents arrived, leading to criticism of the DOJ’s heavy-handed approach. The DOJ’s media release about Houck’s arrest contained discrepancies, and lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Grassley, have called for clarification on the DOJ’s use of force and decision to arrest him instead of allowing voluntary surrender.

Similarly, Paul Vaughn, a father of 11, was arrested at his home in October 2022, more than a year after recording a peaceful pro-life protest outside an abortion clinic. Vaughn’s arrest, which also involved a heavy law enforcement presence, led to further concerns about the DOJ’s selective enforcement of the FACE Act. Vaughn is facing charges under both the FACE Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act, with potential sentences far exceeding those for many violent criminals, prompting additional scrutiny from legal experts.

Both men are charged under the FACE Act, which prohibits the use of force, threats, or physical obstruction to interfere with access to abortion services or places of worship. Critics argue that the Biden administration is misapplying this law, particularly as many pro-life protests are non-violent, and claim that the DOJ has been more aggressive in prosecuting pro-life activists while neglecting to address vandalism and violence against pro-life facilities.

Some experts argue that the Biden administration’s enforcement of the FACE Act is politically motivated, selectively targeting pro-life activists while failing to hold accountable those responsible for attacks on pro-life centers and churches. This has prompted investigations from Congress, with calls for transparency and accountability regarding the DOJ’s actions. Legal professionals suggest that the heavy-handed approach could be intended to intimidate pro-life demonstrators and discourage future activism."

Texas and four other states have sought to use the pandemic as an excuse to suspend peoples access to abortion, characterizing it as not immediately necessary. This should go without saying when abortion is needed, its needed immediately. A global pandemic is no time to play political games with Americans access to time-sensitive health care services. And yet, when we should be working together to ensure everyone has access to the health care they need, anti-abortion extremists are instead wasting valuable time and resources. You need to know we're here with you and that were fighting back. Read on to see how. Why Reproductive Health Care Including Abortion Is Essential Heres the background In an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 and keep hospital beds open, many states are calling for non-essential medical procedures to be postponed until the pandemic subsides. Non-essential or elective medical procedures does not mean optional or unimportant theyre just not urgent, meaning they dont require immediate treatment. So, surgeries for early-stage cancer, joint replacement, or having a gallbladder removed are getting pushed back in states with these new, temporary restrictions. Thats challenging by itself. These changes are leaving some patients stressed out and unsettled, even feeling as if a time bomb was inside them. So what does it mean for a state to include abortion in its list of non-essential medical procedures? Imagine how youd feel if politicians postponed your abortion appointment until the pandemic ends a milestone that could take well into 2021 to reach. Thats what anti-abortion politicians in Texas, Ohio, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma have tried to do. Theyre ignoring the time-sensitive nature of abortion and lumping abortion into their lists of non-essential medical procedures. Medical experts agree that abortion access is not optional. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics Gynecology, abortion is an essential and time-sensitive medical procedure. We cant believe we really need to say this but during a pandemic, people need more access to birth control, abortion, and other reproductive health care, not less. BREAKING We filed an emergency lawsuit today to prevent the state of Alabama from using the COVID-19 crisis to prevent people from obtaining abortion care.Our government's response to the pandemic must be grounded in science and public health, not politics. ACLU ACLU March 30, 2020 Five States Exploiting a Public-Health Crisis The states using the pandemic to try to ban abortion and cut patients off from care are so far Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Ohio, and Alabama. Their cruel, dangerous abortion bans ignore the fact that abortion is essential, time-sensitive health care while doing nothing to show how these states would provide extra care for pregnant women or newborns amid the spread of COVID-19. Texas In Texas on March 22, Governor Greg Abbott banned all procedures that are not immediately medically necessary and he lumped abortion into that group, with the only exception in cases where the pregnancy would cause significant harm to the pregnant person. The Texas abortion ban forced abortion providers across the state to immediately cancel all scheduled appointments for safe, legal abortion. Whole Womens Health alone had to cancel 150 appointments, reporting that patients cried and expressed feelings of helplessness. Some patients whose abortion appointments were canceled reportedly drove hundreds of miles to access care elsewhere a race against the clock before bans on abortion later in pregnancy kicked in. Its unclear what other patients did. Weve taken Texas to court To ensure that people can still access the health care they need, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Lawyering Project filed a lawsuit against the Texas abortion ban. On March 30, a federal judge blocked Texas from banning abortion as part of the states response to the coronavirus outbreak but on the next day, a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the Texas ban. Ohio Ohio had the same bad idea as Texas. On March 22, the Ohio attorney general ordered all abortion clinics to stop performing any abortion in which the mothers health was not at risk, declaring them non-essential. The move was in response to anti-abortion fringe groups, which wouldnt stop harassing state officials until they promised to attack peoples access to safe and legal abortion. During the resulting confusion, Ohio providers had to delay appointments. We got a restraining order against Ohio On March 30, abortion providers in Ohio represented by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU, ACLU of Ohio, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America PPFA, along with local Ohio lawyers took emergency legal action to ensure that they can remain open to provide time-sensitive, critical abortion care to patients. And the same day, a federal judge granted Ohio abortion providers a temporary restraining order to allow abortion services to continue for the time being. Oklahoma On March 24, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt ordered all elective medical and surgical procedures to be postponed. Along with the order, he made a point of prohibiting abortion specifically. We took them to court On March 30, the Center for Reproductive Rights, PPFA, and Dechert LLP challenged Gov. Stitts order. Iowa On March 27, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds followed suit. She banned surgical abortion right along with other non-essential care. How are we fighting back? You guessed it in court On March 30, the ACLU of Iowa, PPFA on behalf of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed a lawsuit against Reynolds and other Iowa state officials. Alabama Earlier in March, Alabamas Department of Public Healths also imposed a ban on non-essential health care, but it seemed to exempt abortion providers at first. At least one of Alabamas abortion providers got an influx of callers from Texas seeking appointments and from protesters threatening to report them to the health department for remaining open. On March 28, Alabamas attorney general expanded the ban to include all medical and surgical procedures except those required to treat emergency conditions that put patients health in serious jeopardy. Given the risk of licensure penalties and being convicted of a crime, abortion providers were forced to cancel appointments and stop providing abortions. Another successful lawsuit The ACLU and Alabama abortion providers are suing the state Department of Public Health to stop it from using the excuse of the COVID-19 crisis to block peoples access to abortion services. Thanks to that lawsuit, on March 30 a federal court blocked the policy so that safe, legal abortion care can continue in Alabama. Were fighting back, but more states could follow the lead of declaring abortion non-essential including Missisippi, which only has one abortion provider. What Happens When People Cant Get Safe, Legal Abortion Care People prevented from getting a safe, legal abortion will have few options Travel to another state if they have the resources to take off work and make the trip and risk exposing themselves or others to the new coronavirus, Try to self-manage an abortion, or Wait until it is too late and they cannot get the care they need which could also mean prenatal visits to doctors and hospitals already stretched thin by the pandemic, increasing the potential of exposure to COVID-19.

These actions were framed as part of broader efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and preserve hospital resources, though critics argue that abortion is a time-sensitive and essential healthcare service. These states’ decisions forced many patients to cancel or reschedule abortion appointments, sometimes requiring long trips to other states or risking delays that could limit access to safe, legal abortion services.

Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, emphasized that abortion is critical and time-sensitive healthcare. Legal challenges were launched in several states to block these abortion restrictions. In Texas, for instance, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state’s ban, while in Ohio, a federal court granted a restraining order allowing abortion providers to continue offering services.

The article highlights the detrimental effects of these bans, noting that individuals denied abortion care could be forced to travel, self-manage their abortion, or risk delaying care until it is too late. This could also increase the strain on healthcare systems already under pressure due to the pandemic. Advocates, such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, continued to fight these restrictions through legal avenues, emphasizing that abortion access must be protected, particularly in times of crisis."

People have hit us with jump ropes and thrown human excrement at us in front of government buildings, college students dress up as vaginas and protest our displays, students approach us on campus and argue the morality of euthanizing children up through toddlerhood You name it, weve been there. Quit talking about abortion while there are hungrysickpoorabused people in the world. Being pro-abortion is Christian. Dont you have anything better to do? But today, were going to focus on one you may have heard before. You arent allowed to be pro-life unless you adopt. And this one is interesting, because almost every single pro-lifer will immediately feel defensive on this one. Just remember its a bit irrational. What To Say First Everyone who feels called to adopt should adopt. The desire to nurture children transcends political party and opinion on abortion its a human quality for most people, anyway. Adoption is amazing and has allowed countless parents and children a new chance at a loving family. As Mike Pence recently noted, there are about the same number of couples hoping to adopt as there are abortions each year. That seems like an easy math equation. This isnt to say adoption is always painless. Pro-lifers acknowledge the emotional difficulty that comes with carrying a child and parting ways after birth. But to live the human experience is to encounter pain. It can help us grow and change as people what is difficult is not always bad. Multiple Students for Life team members have personal experience with adoption, and plenty of national activists do as well. Ryan Bomberger is one of them he was conceived in rape, adopted, and has adopted children of his own. Here, he speaks on his experience at a rally in Alabama The Logic Doesnt Stand You cant be pro-life unless you adopt is an argument that fails to hold up logically. You do not have to take a specific action in order to have the right to form an opinion on a topic. This idea doesnt hold up anywhere else. You dont have to be an African-American to believe that slavery was wrong. You can believe that human trafficking is wrong without donating to Polaris or another anti-trafficking organization. Your beliefs should motivate your actions, but actions are not pre-requisites to belief. Its a common tactic that only seems to be thrown at pro-life people despite not being applicable to any other social justice issue. You dont see anyone approaching pro-choice people and saying, You arent allowed to be pro-choice unless you counsel women with Post-Abortion Syndrome. Its a bullying tactic thats typically only dished with malicious intent. Further, not everyone is able to adopt. Hypothetically, consider a single woman with a small income that only supports herself. Shes not in a position to adopt a child is she allowed to sidewalk counsel outside Planned Parenthood because she believes abortion is wrong? If an argument only holds up a little it doesnt hold up at all. The Fun Twist The neat part is that pro-lifers do adopt. Heavily. Pro-life people adopt en masse, despite not having to in order to earn the title of being pro-life. And if we arent adopting, were participating in some other active, supportive service to benefit women facing unplanned pregnancies. Its us who are running the 17,000 pregnancy resource centers nationwide that provide free counseling, material resources, parenting classes, and sometimes even medical attention to those in need. And there are many more organizations in addition to literal pregnancy centers such as maternity homes, charities, church organizations, and more. So, this may be worth noting in a conversation in which someone is suggesting you arent allowed to be pro-life. But the lack of logic in the original accusation stands You are allowed to believe a bad thing is wrong. Period.

It argues that this idea is illogical and unfairly targeted at pro-life individuals, as no other social justice issue requires direct action to form an opinion or take a stance. For example, people can oppose slavery or human trafficking without being directly involved in those issues.

The piece begins by emphasizing the importance and value of adoption. It acknowledges the emotional challenges involved, but it also highlights the positive impact adoption can have on both parents and children. The article references figures like Mike Pence, who pointed out the balance between the number of couples hoping to adopt and the number of abortions, suggesting that adoption could be a solution. It also cites Ryan Bomberger, a pro-life activist who was adopted after being conceived in rape, as an example of how adoption can offer new chances for families.

The article challenges the argument that pro-life people must adopt by noting that beliefs should guide actions, but they are not dependent on them. Just as people can oppose slavery or trafficking without participating in those causes directly, pro-lifers are allowed to advocate for the unborn without adopting. Furthermore, not everyone is in a position to adopt—such as a single woman with a low income—but that doesn’t diminish her right to oppose abortion.

Finally, the article points out that pro-lifers already engage in many forms of support for pregnant women, such as running thousands of pregnancy resource centers and other charitable organizations that offer free counseling, material aid, and medical assistance. This shows that pro-lifers are actively helping in many ways, even if adoption is not always an option for them.

The main takeaway from the article is that being pro-life is about the belief in the sanctity of life, and people do not need to adopt to be considered pro-life. Their stance can inspire action, but it does not require a specific form of involvement, such as adoption."

While the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance EACH Woman Act of 2019 and the Womens Health Protection Act of 2019 promise to expand abortion access at a federal level, the real battle over abortionand who can access itplays out on the state level. These bans introduce additional financial hardship because those who need an abortion later in pregnancy now have to travel to different states. Its no surprise that Southern states have highly limited access to abortion. Some of the nations most regressive bills, such as six-week bans, fetal remains burial laws, and judicial bypass, are commonplace. While many of these bills are unenforceable due to their unconstitutionality, they are nonetheless extremely dangerous. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, a total of twenty-four states and territories in the United States have laws or provisions written into their state constitutions that would automatically ban abortion if the federal right to abortion were to fall. In essence, if Roe v. Wade were to be overturneda likely scenario given the extremely conservative makeup of the Supreme Courtalmost every state in the U.S. South would outlaw abortion outright. Except for one Florida. Not many people see Florida as a bastion of reproductive freedom. Despite a history of conservative politicians and current hostility toward abortion, the state actually has no trigger laws or Constitutional abortion bans in place. If Roe falls, pregnant people from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and likely the Carolinas will make their way to Florida to access abortion care. It would be disastrous, then, for politicians to undermine the potential safety that Florida offers pregnant people by making the procedure even harder to access today. There are currently a slew of laws already on the books that make abortion difficult to access. According to the Guttmacher Institute, these include regulations that Require patients to receive biased state-mandated counseling designed to discourage them from obtaining an abortion. Bar the use of the states public insurance to cover the cost of an abortion unless their life is in danger. Require that minors notify their parents or guardians of their procedure unless they obtain a judicial bypass. Mandate a medically unnecessary ultrasound and make doctors explicitly ask patients if they would like to view it. Ban all abortions after twenty-four-weeks. The overwhelming number of regulations hasnt stopped Republican lawmakers from attempting to add more. For instance, Florida Senate Bill 744House Bill 351, officially titled Protection of a Pain-capable Unborn Child from Abortion, unilaterally prevents anyone from obtaining an abortion on or after the twentieth week of pregnancy. Despite there being no conclusive evidence that fetuses can feel pain at any point during pregnancy, this bill is intentionally meant to deceive unaware people into thinking that fetuses are more important than the actual pregnant person. These politicians do not care about fetal pain. They certainly dont care about the pain of their living, breathing constituents who are minors, 55 percent of whom are living in poverty, compared 14.4 percent of all children nationally. This bill is just another way that anti-abortion lawmakers are trying to control the lives and futures of pregnant people. Our callers are reaching out to us because they are facing a barrier to abortion access, says Kris Lawler, intake volunteer and board member of the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. Despite the ability of states to pass laws until the burden on the patient becomes undue, Lawler isnt buying that these bans arent exactly that. Its supposed to be an undue burden, but every single person we talk to is facing some type of hurdle or burden. These bans, on top of what they are already facing, are undue. Amber Gavin, an employee of A Womans Choice, an independent clinic in Florida, is already familiar with the effects of a twenty-week ban because of one of the clinics other locations in North Carolina, where there is a nineteen-week ban in place. The majority of all abortions across the country are done earlier in pregnancy, Gavin says, but bans like this actually delay care. They dont delay people needing that care. These bans introduce additional financial hardship because those who need an abortion later in pregnancy now have to travel to different states. This means, she explains, multiple days off from work, child care because most people who are seeking an abortion already have children, the costs of hotels and flights. And, of course, the further along in pregnancy the person is, the more the procedure will cost. The Guttmacher Institute found that if this bill is passed, the average one-way driving distance for a Florida woman of reproductive age to a clinic that could provide abortion care at or after twenty weeks would increase from fourteen miles to 469 milesmore than thirty times as far. Put another way, that would be a nearly eight-hour road trip each way on average, if driving nonstop at sixty miles per hour. Another Florida bill being considered is SB 1664HB 1221, which would outlaw all abortions on the basis of the disability of the fetus. Dont be fooled Republicans in office pushing these bills only care about disabled people before theyre born. When the living disabled community requires health care, aid, and accommodations, those same Republicans are nowhere to be found. Another bill is particularly grotesque. House Bill 1437 would require people to choose to either cremate or bury the remains of the pregnancy, or else they or the abortion provider will face punishments. It is such a waste of time for our elected officials to focus yet again on banning abortion, said U.S. Representative Val Demings of Florida in a local town hall. I fully support a womans right to choose. My gosh, cant we get over this and focus on the things that really help to improve the quality of life for people who are suffering in this country? And Florida isnt the only state mulling new anti-abortion laws. Five states have enacted laws preventing abortion based on fetal anomalies. Dozens of states have tried to introduce twenty-week abortion bans based on the false notion that fetuses can feel pain after that time, and its even been introduced as HR 36 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Elected representatives in these and other states need to hear from their constituents who want to protect access to safe and legal abortion.

Main Street, Suite 10 Madison, Wisconsin 53703 608 257-4626 Built with Metro Publisher","The article discusses the ongoing battle over abortion rights in Florida, emphasizing the state’s unique position in the South. Unlike other Southern states, Florida does not have an outright abortion ban or trigger laws that would automatically ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned. This makes Florida a crucial access point for people seeking abortions from nearby states with more restrictive laws.

While the state has not yet passed an outright ban, there are significant barriers to accessing abortion care, including mandatory counseling, parental consent requirements for minors, and limitations on the use of public insurance for abortion services. A variety of bills are being proposed to further restrict abortion access, including Senate Bill 744/House Bill 351, which would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks, despite a lack of scientific evidence that fetuses can feel pain at that stage. These restrictions disproportionately affect people already facing financial hardships, as traveling to out-of-state clinics for later abortions imposes significant costs.

Another controversial bill, HB 1437, would mandate the burial or cremation of fetal remains, imposing penalties on those who do not comply. These and other proposed laws, including bans on abortions based on fetal disabilities, have prompted opposition from activists and politicians like U.S. Representative Val Demings, who argue that lawmakers should focus on improving people’s lives rather than restricting abortion rights.

The article highlights the broader national context, noting that other states are also considering or have enacted similar restrictions, such as bans on abortion based on fetal anomalies or the false premise that fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks. The piece calls for continued advocacy to protect access to safe and legal abortion care."

Deconstructing an argument aimed at pro-lifers Pro-abortion protesters took to the streets of Los Angeles last Tuesday. Getty ImagesPhoto by Keith BirminghamMediaNews GroupPasadena Star-News Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., once quipped that a pro-life advocate is someone who believes that life begins at conception and ends at birth. Once the child is born, the argument goes, pro-life advocates no longer care. Similarly, the Los Angeles Times last month published a feature about the life of Christy Berghoef that parallels Franks claim. Berghoef evidently outgrew her staunchly pro-life upbringing in rural Michigan and now defines herself as broadly pro-life from the womb to the tomb. For Berghoef, and many like her, the breakthrough to a broader pro-life position includes moving politically leftward on such issues as gun control, immigration, healthcare, and poverty. Recent years have brought a deluge of deconstruction stories in which people like Berghoef purport to dismantle the narrow-minded confines of conservative Christianity. Common threads run through these deconstruction stories, including a desire to breathe fresh air beyond the stifling judgmentalism, the aversion to nuance, presuming the worst of others motives, conflating ones view with the only conceivably true view, and so on. Let us attempt an exercise in deconstructing such deconstructions of faith. Assuming that those who reject leftist positions do so because they dont care about life from the womb to the tomb is a particular kind of judgmentalism. It makes a rather holier-than-thou, unnuanced, exclusivist presumption about the motives held by millions of Americans. It presupposes, rather uncharitably, that callousness, apathy, ignorance, or disdain are the only conceivable reasons anyone might not support certain solutions to such problems. There is, however, a world of difference between not caring for the poor and thinking that typical leftist policies are not the best way to help the poor. That gaping difference is evidenced by the fact that conservative households donate substantially more money to charity than liberal ones. A 2018 Barna study found that practicing Christians outpace all other demographics in providing food to the poor, donating clothing and furniture to the poor, praying for the poor, and giving personal time to serve the poor in their communities and beyond U.S. borders. The belief that we either rally for more expansive government attempts to alleviate poverty, or we dont care about alleviating poverty, can be a rather stifling if not self-righteous way to frame our options. Is it possible that many people reject leftist policies precisely because they care about life from the womb to the tomb? To deny that possibility reeks of a certain dogmatism. Many who champion the leftward womb-to-tomb perspective look with admiration at European countries with more expansive government welfare systems Yet, according to Harvard social scientist Arthur C. Brooks, numerous studies have demonstrated that a dollar in government spending on nonprofit activities displaces up to 50 cents in private giving, and the highest level of crowding out occurs in assistance to the poor and other kinds of social welfare services. We could add that Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have become prosperous with scant natural resources as they have embraced free markets, while resource-rich Russia and Brazil languish in poverty under big government systems that claim to uplift the poor. In the United States, the top 10 cities with the highest rates of homelessness, along with the top 25 most dangerous cities, share one thing in common They are all run by Democrats. Again, is it possible that many people reject leftist policies precisely because they care about life from the womb to the tomb? To deny that possibility reeks of a certain dogmatism. The same can be said for other controversial questions wrapped up in the womb to tomb slogan. There is a difference between not caring for the victims of gun violence and thinking that leftist gun control policies are not the best way to curb gun violence. There is a difference between not caring for immigrants and supporting legal immigration. Not caring about the sick and seeing problems with government-run healthcare programs are not interchangeable. Conflating the two is hardly kind or open-minded. It is a kind of fundamentalist faith that should not be immune to deconstruction. My point is that the very existence of such arguments, the fact that they are commonplace in conservative circles, shows that it is not a simple black-and-white matter of who cares for the poor and who doesnt. Am I saying that the political right is, therefore, infallible or synonymous with true Christianity? Far from it. There is much to our right that bears no resemblance to what Jesus stands for. I am simply arguing that the trendy womb-to-tomb argument, when used to lure people leftward, is just one more illustration of the deconstructionist lurch to the ideological left.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","In the article Pro-life from womb to tomb? by Thaddeus Williams, the author critiques the argument that pro-life advocates only care about life before birth and disregard issues like poverty, gun violence, and healthcare after birth. This perspective is often attributed to pro-life advocates by those who adopt a “pro-life from womb to tomb” stance, advocating for left-leaning political solutions, including expansive government programs. The article argues that this critique is overly simplistic and judgmental, assuming that those who reject leftist policies are callous or apathetic.

Williams contends that rejecting leftist policies does not equate to not caring about life from conception to death. He points out that conservative Christians often give more to charity, serve the poor, and engage in community welfare activities more than their liberal counterparts. The author also discusses the inefficiencies of government welfare programs, citing studies showing that government spending often displaces private charity. He suggests that conservative beliefs about poverty and social issues stem from a concern for life, not a lack of compassion.

The article further emphasizes that there are significant differences between caring about issues like gun violence, immigration, and healthcare and supporting leftist solutions. Williams critiques the reductionist thinking that equates disagreement with left-wing policies to a lack of concern for human well-being.

Finally, Williams acknowledges that political conservatism is not perfect and that some of its tenets may not align with Christian values. However, he argues that using the “womb to tomb” label to push people leftward oversimplifies complex issues and promotes an ideological shift that may not be as compassionate as it claims."

PTIMore than 80 of a workforce of around 450 million is in the informal, unorganised sector, without assured wages unless they can work. Most have received no wages during lockdown. By Supriya ChaudhuriOn May 9, many Indians woke up to photographs of rotis, slippers, clothes and possibly limbs strewn on the railway line between Jalna and Aurangabad in Maharashtra where 16 migrant workers, having dozed off on the tracks after having walked 36 km of an 850 km journey home, were run over by a freight train. Even in a country that has become inured to inequality, injustice and the cruelty of the state, the sight of those scattered rotis should have stung like a whip. Unfortunately, this is far from the case. The Indian middle class, long accustomed to turning its back on suffering, is now asking why these workers were sleeping on the railway line, and whether they had planned mass suicide. Such speculations are undeterred by survivors accounts of exhaustion, police harassment driving them to the tracks, the mistaken belief that trains were not running and, above all, the psychological and physical consequences of State abandonment, dulling the awareness of risk. But the labouring classes, especially poor tribals in the lowest stratum of the workforce, are not supposed to have a psychology, far less a limit to their physical endurance. Those who ask why people fall asleep on railway lines are unlikely to have walked 36 km through the night with the railway track providing the only sense of direction. Nor do they know what risk means for workers whose money has run out, who have no wages, cannot pay rent, and receive relief intermittently or not at all. The day before the Aurangabad tragedy, Krishna Sahoo and his wife Pramila, trying to cycle home with their two young children from Lucknow to Bemetara in Chattisgarh, a distance of 700 km, were run over almost immediately by an unidentified vehicle. They were killed, their children orphaned. Figures up to May 9 count 69 workers killed in road and rail accidents while trying to reach home since the lockdown began, sometimes stowing away in trucks and buses. Not counted are those who died of heat and exhaustion on the road, almost in sight of their destination, like the 12-year-old Jamalo Makdam on April 18 in Chhattisgarh. Yet, on March 31, a week into the lockdown, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured the Supreme Court on oath that not a single migrant was on the road any longer they had all been taken to shelters and provided with food and water. This was patently untrue. Since then, migrant workers have been crammed by police into container trucks buses transporting them have been stopped at state borders trains have been announced and then cancelled and they have been forced to pay enhanced fares for the few buses and trains that started running from May 1. Unsurprisingly, there have been protests and violence at bus and train stations. Meanwhile, the lines of those who are trying to walk or cycle home remain unending. Around 120 million of Indias population are seasonal or longerterm migrants from rural to largely urban markets. More than 80 of a workforce of around 450 million is in the informal, unorganised sector, without assured wages unless they can work. Most have received no wages during lockdown. The task of providing these jobless labourers in-state or out-of-state and their families with food was delegated by the Centre to the states. Only 17.5 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been lifted so far from the overflowing Food Corporation of India FCI godowns containing 560 lakh tonnes. Many states are relying on NGOs and volunteer groups to reach the hungry. Rations are insufficient even for those with ration cards, and migrants do not have them. Most are not registered with state labour departments. As to shelter, unpaid rent means that millions face eviction though Chief Justice Sharad Bobde says migrants do not need money if they get food. In the next phase, changes to labour laws will mean less security and longer hours. The decision to walk home pits exploitation, eviction, hunger and joblessness, against the risks of the road, home, family, possibly work on the land. Which would you choose? The decision to lock down this country at four hours notice rendered a huge segment of its working population, at a stroke, dependent on handouts. The operative word here is working. The Indian middle class likes to commiserate with the poor, setting up community kitchens, donating to relief funds. But these people we see collapsing on the road, getting run over by trains, leaving their scorched rotis on the tracks, are not the faceless, nameless poor whose relief sends a thrill of piety through our middle-class hearts. They are workers who can justifiably claim the right to livelihood and the dignity of their labour. They did not work all their lives to squat on the road for free meals. They are individuals, persons who decide to go or to stay. The rotis they left on the tracks were theirs, made by the same hands that laid bricks and carried loads. Only the death that comes to them, like a monster on the tracks, is not of their making.

In early May 2020, 16 migrant workers died in Maharashtra after walking 36 km in exhaustion and then falling asleep on railway tracks, only to be run over by a train. The incident, along with similar tragedies, underscores the extreme hardships faced by informal sector workers, many of whom have been without wages during the lockdown and are forced to undertake perilous journeys to their home states in search of food and shelter.

The writer critiques the Indian middle class’s tendency to speculate about the workers’ plight without understanding the brutal conditions they face. Many of these workers are from poor, marginalized communities and have been abandoned by the state. While some middle-class groups set up relief efforts, the article stresses that these workers are not faceless poor but individuals with the right to livelihood and dignity.

Further, it points out the inefficiencies of the government’s response, such as misleading statements about migrants being housed and fed, while millions continue to walk long distances, facing harassment from police, inadequate shelter, and insufficient food aid. The tragedy of these deaths is attributed to the government’s failure to adequately support the working class, many of whom are trapped in the informal sector, without job security or social safety nets.

The article calls for a recognition of the workers’ right to life and the need for the state to ensure their well-being and dignity, rather than leaving them to die on the roads or railway tracks."
Pete Buttigieg's abortion view shows why Trump wins conservatives,"Pete Buttigieg's abortion view shows why Trump wins conservativesNews North Sports Indy 500 Things To Do Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals JAMES BRIGGSBriggs Buttigieg's abortion view shows why frustrated conservatives stick with Trump James BriggsIndyStarPete Buttigieg has emerged from Iowa and New Hampshire as arguably the most viable moderate seeking the Democratic nomination for president. That is a striking statement about where the Democratic Party stands on abortion in 2020.As I previously wrote, Buttigieg is not just a moderate. He is a moderate running a campaign that is so moderately steeped in moderatism that he is driving many liberal Democrats, particularly supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, to irrational hatred.You might expect such a candidate to have staked out some sort of middle ground on abortion. Buttigieg has not and his position reveals why many people who are otherwise open to voting for Democrats find the party so hostile to their values that they are sticking with President Donald Trump despite many reservations.Consider an exchange in which Kristen Day, the president of Democrats for Life, asked Buttigieg a fascinating question about abortion during a Jan. 26 Fox News town hall.I am a proud pro-life Democrat, Day told Buttigieg. Do you want the support of pro-life Democratic voters?Buttigieg essentialy replied that, yes, he wants Days vote, but does not intend to make any policy accommodations for her viewpoint on abortion.I respect where youre coming from and I hope to earn your vote, but Im not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you, Buttigieg said. I am pro-choice. And I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision.That is, of course, the Democratic position on abortion. But, until recently, Democrats at least tipped their hat to the idea that, aside from legality, reducing the number of abortions is generally a good goal. Buttigieg offered no such rhetorical concession.Sarah Pulliam Bailey of The Washington Post wrote a smart analysis of Buttigiegs response to Days question, while also explaining how Democrats have moved well left since former president Bill Clinton said he wanted to make abortion safe, legal and rare and perhaps even since 2018 when Indiana had a pro-life Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly.More from BriggsPete Buttigieg is an elitist. He should embrace it.Antiabortion Democrats, she writes, have become politically homeless and, as a result, less enthusiastic supporters of the party.That is one problem for Democrats. A more significant problem is that many Republicans who are fed up with the corruption and mismanagement that have defined the Trump administration are nonetheless prepared to vote for Trump again because they are satisfied that he has fulfilled his promise to chip away at abortion, most notably through Supreme Court appointments.Democrats tend to be perplexed by the dissonance of voters who consider Trump a bad president, yet are likely to vote for him anyway. That misunderstanding comes, at least in part, because the Democratic Party has become too dismissive of conservatives sincere beliefs about abortion, as evidenced by Buttigiegs unwillingness to bend even rhetorically toward the right.Christian ethics professor Andrew T. Walker explained the perspective of frustrated, nose-holding Trump voters in a National Review essay.To the average religious conservative like me, there is no moral ambiguity about abortion. It must be stopped. Its a morally transcendent issue. The figures bear out the astonishing loss of life sanctioned by American law, Walker writes. That does not make other issues totally irrelevant to religious conservatism. It does evidence a moral urgency that forces religious conservatives to triage their votes.Immigration policy matters. Police brutality cannot fall on deaf ears. Opioid addiction is ravaging America. Religious conservatives care about these issues and work to find solutions. But to religious conservatives, these concerns do not rise to the level of what seems to be a targeted, lavishly funded assault on human life itself, one proceeding from a worldview that rejects the metaphysical claims of Christianity.'Today is a moment of truth' Buttigieg abruptly ends presidential bid 25 images from Pete Buttigieg's 11-month campaign Hashtag 'ThankYouPete' trends on Twitter after Buttigieg suspends bid Limited cash and other observations as Buttigieg courts South CarolinaDemocrats are not going to adopt this worldview. They don't have to. But, by leaving no room for it in the party, they risk sacrificing progress on a multitude of issues over their rigidity on one.The view that abortion ends a life is not only defensible in the realm of religious belief, but it is also entirely mainstream. About half of Americans think that abortion is morally wrong, while one-fifth think that it is morally acceptable, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey.On the other hand, a 2019 Pew Research Center survey shows 70 percent of Americans do not think the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling Roe v. Wade should be completely overturned. This cross section of public opinion suggests there should be room for a Clintonesque position that seeks to keep abortion legal while reducing the numbers.Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota who rode a late wave of momentum to a third-place finish behind Buttigieg in New Hampshire, made that point in the past week. She is the only Democratic presidential contender so far to do so, but she did not explain what tolerance to antiabortion views looks like in 2020.""There are pro-life Democrats, and they are part of our party, and I think we need to build a big tent,"" Klobuchar told ABC.Meanwhile, in Buttigiegs hometown of South Bend, about 100 people on Wednesday attended a mass burial for 2,411 fetal remains that were found in the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer.It has become easy for Democrats to ignore such demonstrations particularly when divisive Republicans stand at the center of them, as Attorney General Curtis Hill did in South Bend. To be sure, disingenuous abortion politics abound. That does not invalidate the earnest values that compel people to show up for a fetal remains funeral on a winter day in Indiana.It is not hard to find people who both oppose abortion and are dissatisfied with Trumps performance as president. But if Buttigiegs position on abortion is indicative of the choices conservatives will face in November, it might be hard for Democrats to win any of them.Contact IndyStar metro columnist James Briggs at 317-444-6307.

Buttigieg, who has positioned himself as a moderate in the 2020 Democratic race, holds a pro-choice position that aligns with the broader Democratic platform. When asked by Kristen Day, a pro-life Democrat, if he would consider making policy concessions to pro-life voters, Buttigieg stated that he would not compromise on his pro-choice beliefs. This response reflects a shift in the Democratic Party, which, according to Briggs, has become increasingly dismissive of conservative views on abortion.

The column critiques the Democratic Party’s rigidity on abortion, suggesting that it alienates not only religious conservatives but also moderate voters who may otherwise be open to supporting the party. While Republicans, especially Trump supporters, may disapprove of his presidency, they continue to support him due to his judicial appointments, which have eroded abortion rights. Briggs contends that for many religious conservatives, abortion is a fundamental moral issue that outweighs other concerns, such as immigration or police brutality. This belief is reflected in surveys showing a significant portion of Americans view abortion as morally wrong.

While some Democrats, like Senator Amy Klobuchar, have called for a more inclusive approach that recognizes pro-life Democrats, Buttigieg’s unwavering stance on abortion risks further alienating this group. The column concludes by suggesting that if Democratic candidates continue to ignore or dismiss anti-abortion views, they may struggle to win over conservatives, even those dissatisfied with Trump’s performance as president."

Joyce Krawiec, a Republican, said during the press conference, according to local ABC affiliate WTVD. ""We are beginning the process of creating a culture that values life, and that's something we can all be incredibly proud of.""North Carolina state Sen. Joyce Krawiec, a Forsyth County Republican, speaks at a news conference on proposed new abortion restrictions, May 2, 2023, at the Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C.Hannah SchoenbaumAPBefore an abortion is performed, pregnant people must receive a consultation in person at least 72 hours prior about the potential risks of receiving an abortion and other options, including adoption or that the father is liable to pay child support.Research has shown that abortions performed in a clean area with properly trained staff are very safe. Between 2013 and 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the national case-fatality rate was 0.41 abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal abortions.The pregnant person must also receive an ultrasound prior to the abortion as well as notice that they can look at ""the remains"" after the procedure is completed.Providers who perform an abortion past 12 weeks will be required to provide information to the state Department of Health and Human Services, including ""the probable gestational age"" of the fetus, its measurements and an ultrasound image as well as how the provider determined the pregnancy fell into one of the exceptions.Any physician who violates the bill will be subject to discipline from the North Carolina Medical Board, which includes potentially being placed on probation, public reprimanding, paying a fine, educational training or having their license revoked.MORE How some providers are working around abortion bans since Roe v. Wade was overturned Gov. Roy Cooper's tweeted a statement Wednesday that he did not support the bill and planned to veto it.""It will effectively ban access to reproductive freedom earlier and sometimes altogether for many women because of new restrictions and requirements,"" he wrote. ""This is why Republicans are ramming it through with no chance to amend. I will veto this extreme ban and need everyone's help to avoid it.""Cooper's veto power, if the bill is passed, would only delay its enactment. Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate and are close to a supermajority in the House, which would override the veto.Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over the summer, 15 states have ceased nearly all abortion services.Abortion rights demonstrators gather to protest against the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health case, June 24, 2022 in Raleigh, N.C. The Court's decision in the case overturns the landmark 50-year-old Roe v Wade case, removing a federal right to an abortion.Anadolu Agency via Getty Images, FILEFlorida will be the 16th state once a new six-week abortion ban is implemented -- but only if the state's current 15-week ban is upheld as legal challenges play out in court.Additionally, Utah passed a bill earlier this year banning abortion clinics in the state.

The current law allows abortions up to 20 weeks. The bill, titled “The Care for Women, Children and Families Act,” includes exceptions for rape and incest up to 20 weeks and for fetal anomalies up to 24 weeks. The bill maintains the exception for situations where the mother’s life is at risk.

Before undergoing an abortion, individuals would be required to have an in-person consultation 72 hours in advance, during which they would be informed about the risks of abortion and alternative options, such as adoption. They would also have to receive an ultrasound and be informed about the potential to view the remains after the procedure.

Physicians who perform abortions beyond 12 weeks would need to report detailed information to the state, including the gestational age and ultrasound images. Violations of the law could result in disciplinary action by the North Carolina Medical Board, including fines or the loss of a medical license.

Governor Roy Cooper expressed opposition to the bill, vowing to veto it, although Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate and are close to having one in the House, which could override his veto. This bill follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has led to increased abortion restrictions across several states."

Those living in the poorest countries, in the most marginalized communities, face the greatest challenges in access, the highest burden of disease, and the worst health outcomes. End virginity testingVirginity testing has no scientific or clinical basis. There is no examination that can prove a girl or woman has had sex and the appearance of girls or womans hymen cannot prove whether they have had sexual intercourse, or are sexually active or not.Virginity testing is a violation of the human rights of girls and women, and can be detrimental to womens and girls physical, psychological and social well-being. The practice also reinforces stereotyped notions of female sexuality and gender inequality. The examination can be painful, humiliating and traumatic. Given that these procedures are unnecessary and potentially harmful, WHO supports putting an end to these practices, through law and policy reform, awareness raising and technical support. It is unethical for doctors or other health providers to undertake them. Such procedures must never be carried out.Eliminating virginity testing An interagency statementEnsure respect dignity for women during childbirthEngaging women and accounting for their experiences in health systems is the first order of respect in a human rights approach to maternal care. Yet, evidence has shown the range and pervasiveness of mistreatment to which women are subjected during childbirth globally, including forms of physical and verbal abuse experiences of discrimination and neglect and denials of privacy and confidentiality. These types of treatment can amount to a violation of a womans fundamental human rights. Every woman has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to dignified, respectful health care throughout pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the right to be free from violence and discrimination. Provision of respectful maternity care is in accordance with a human rights-based approach to reducing maternal morbidity and mortality could improve womens experience of labour and childbirth and address health inequalities.New WHO evidence on mistreatment of women during childbirthEnd preventable maternal mortality and morbidityIncreasingly UN treaty monitoring bodies, regional and national courts have called upon States to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information and services to women and adolescents. If they do not do so, States may not meet their treaty and constitutional obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to life, the right to non-discrimination, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and the rights to privacy, confidentiality, information and education.To end preventable maternal and newborn deaths and decrease morbidities, the topmost priorities of a health agenda for a sustainable future must include educating and empowering all women and girls, gender equality, poverty reduction, universal health coverage and access to comprehensive reproductive health services, and equity within the overall context of a rights-based approach to health and health care. High andor disproportionate levels of maternal deaths and harms are linked to the lack of comprehensive reproductive health services, unsafe abortion, adolescent pregnancy, child and forced marriage and inadequate access to contraceptives. The prevention of maternal mortality and the provision of maternal health services, including the provision of safe abortion services to the full extent of the law, is fundamental to the achievement of health.WHO supports and leads in efforts to understand the causes and context of maternal mortality and morbidity through technical support, research, law and policy reform, and awareness raising.WHOs work on maternal healthWHOs work on safe abortionRightToABetterWorld episode 3 of 4 Maternal mortality and morbidityComprehensive sexuality education healthy, empowered future generationsAs they transition from childhood to adulthood, adolescents undergo a number of physical, psychological and social changes for which they are often unprepared. They need knowledge and skills to make well-informed choices about their lives, to avoid problems and to deal with them effectively if they occur.There is strong evidence that well-designed and well-delivered comprehensive sexuality education contributes to improved knowledge and understanding, to positive attitudes and to healthy sexual behaviours. There is no evidence that it contributes to early, increased or more sexual risk taking.States have an obligation under human rights law to provide information and education to adolescents. CSE is part of the core obligations of states to uphold the right to sexual and reproductive health, which means that it is considered one of the basic minimum actions states must take to give meaning to this right.Based on the evidence and the human rights rationale, WHO recommends the provision of age-appropriate, scientifically-accurate comprehensive sexuality education within and outside schools.Brief sexuality-related communication Recommendations for a public health approachInternational technical guidance on sexuality education An evidence-informed approachRightToABetterWorld episode 1 of 4 Comprehensive sexuality educationampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampnbspEliminate female genital mutilationThe term ""female genital mutilation "" also called ""female genital cutting "" and ""female genital mutilationcutting "" refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Female genital mutilation has no known health benefits and is harmful to girls.Seen from a human rights perspective, the practice reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. Female genital mutilation is nearly always carried out on minors and is therefore a violation of the rights of the child. The practice also violates the rights to health, security and physical integrity of the person, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death. In addition to violating these rights, health professionals who perform female genital mutilation are also violating the fundamental ethical principle do no harm.An interagency statement issued by WHO calls on all States, international and national organizations, civil society and communities to uphold the rights of girls and women. It also call on those bodies and communities to develop, strengthen, and support specific and concrete actions directed towards ending female genital mutilation.WHO's work the elimination of female genital mutilationEnd violence against womenViolence against women is a major public health and human rights concern, with intimate partner violence and sexual violence the most common forms of violence against women. They happen in ALL countries across the world and have been called the most pervasive violation of womens human rights, affecting their rights to freedom from discrimination, to life, to integrity and security of the person, and to the highest attainable standard of health, among others.Under human rights treaties that governments have signed, there is a responsibility to prevent, investigate and punish all forms of violence against women, including those that take place within the home.Health-care providers are in a unique position to create a safe and confidential environment for facilitating disclosure of violence, while offering appropriate support and referral to other resources and services.National guidelines or protocols for the health system should be developed that are consistent with international human rights standards and WHO guidelines.WHO's work on violence against womenRightToABetterWorld episode 4 of 4 Violence against womenStop child marriageChild marriage is a widespread, harmful traditional practice. Every year, about 12 million girls from around the world are married before the age of 18.Ninety percent of births to adolescents aged 15-19 worldwide occur within marriage. Adolescent pregnancies and childbearing are associated with a range of negative maternal health outcomes, especially in younger adolescents. Adolescents married before 18 have a higher risk of intimate partner violence. Child marriage also has a negative effect on secondary school enrolment, retention and completion, with lifelong consequences.States have obligations under human rights law to prevent and address harmful traditional practices such as child marriage. States must adopt legislative measures to expressly prohibit these practices, which are a form of gender-based violence, including social measures, combined with other legal and policy measures, including social measures. These measures must include attention to girls who have victims of child marriage. WHO calls for complementary actions at the legal and policy level, the family and community level including increasing educational opportunities, and at the individual level informing and empowering girls.Child, early and forced marriage legislation in 37 Asia-Pacific countriesEnsure contraceptive choiceEnsuring access to contraception is a fundamental part of upholding human rights as well as contributing to improved health outcomes, with direct benefits for individuals, families, communities and wider society. The right of couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly if, when and how many children to have requires that contraceptive services be available, accessible, acceptable and of good quality, and provided without discrimination.There is increasing momentum to ensure promotion and protection of human rights in contraceptive services and programs. Despite these efforts, human rights are often not explicitly integrated into the design, implementation and monitoring of services. As a result, the unmet need for contraception remains staggeringly high, especially among vulnerable groups such as adolescent girls.WHO's work on contraceptionRightToABetterWorld episode 2 of 4 Contraceptionampampampampampampampnbsp Read more on the right to health Your Right To A Better World 18 November 2020 Beijing25 where are we now, and where do we go next? 27 October 2020 How human rights help ensure high-quality contraceptive services 26 September 2017 Human rights 1 December 2023 Policies Cyber security Ethics Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Library Procurement Frequently asked questions Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy 2024 WHO","The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the importance of sexual and reproductive health and human rights, advocating for policies and practices that ensure access to essential health services for all, particularly for women and marginalized communities. The WHO works on several key issues to protect and promote these rights:
	1.	Virginity Testing: WHO opposes virginity testing, a harmful practice with no scientific basis that violates the human rights of women and girls. It can cause physical, psychological, and social harm, reinforcing gender inequality. WHO calls for an end to such practices through legal reform and awareness campaigns.
	2.	Respectful Maternity Care: The WHO stresses the need for respectful and dignified care during childbirth. Evidence shows that many women face mistreatment, including abuse and discrimination, during childbirth. WHO promotes a rights-based approach to maternal care, which includes the right to be free from violence and discrimination, aiming to improve maternal health outcomes.
	3.	Preventing Maternal Mortality: WHO advocates for comprehensive reproductive health services to prevent maternal deaths and morbidities, particularly in low-income regions. Safe abortion services and education for women and girls are key components of reducing preventable maternal deaths.
	4.	Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE): WHO supports the provision of age-appropriate, scientifically accurate sexuality education, which is proven to lead to healthier sexual behaviors and better outcomes for adolescents. CSE is a human rights obligation and is essential for empowering young people to make informed decisions.
	5.	Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM): WHO condemns FGM, which has no health benefits and violates the rights of girls. The practice is rooted in gender inequality and is considered a form of discrimination and violence. WHO calls for global action to end FGM through legal reforms and community-based interventions.
	6.	Violence Against Women: WHO addresses intimate partner violence and sexual violence, which are pervasive human rights violations. Health care providers are in a unique position to offer support and ensure a safe environment for victims. WHO promotes national guidelines for addressing violence against women in health systems.
	7.	Child Marriage: WHO works to prevent child marriage, a harmful practice linked to negative health outcomes, particularly maternal health risks and intimate partner violence. WHO calls for legal and policy reforms to prohibit child marriage and promote education and empowerment for girls.
	8.	Contraceptive Access: WHO advocates for universal access to contraceptive services, emphasizing the right of individuals and couples to decide freely and responsibly on family planning. The availability of quality contraceptive services is crucial to improving health outcomes and reducing unmet needs, especially among vulnerable groups like adolescent girls.

In summary, WHO’s approach to sexual and reproductive health is centered around a human rights framework, focusing on eliminating harmful practices, ensuring access to essential health services, and empowering individuals, particularly women and girls, to make informed decisions about their health and futures."

If the Senate confirms Judge Amy Coney Barrett, roughly 25 million women of reproductive age could lose abortion access. Here's how we know 1. Barrett has a long record of hostility to reproductive health and rights. Her writings, speeches, and rulings all add up to another vote to restrict abortion rights if she is confirmed to the Supreme Court. 2. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, individual states will decide whether abortion is legal. Ten states in the South, Midwest, and Mountain West regions could ban abortion through trigger laws designed to automatically make abortion illegal if Roe v. Wade falls. And right now, 17 abortion-related cases are one step from the Supreme Court most involve restrictions that effectively ban abortion, without the need to overturn Roe v. Wade directly. 3. 20 states have a combination of trigger laws, pre-Roe bans, andor legislatures hostile to reproductive health care. The politicians in power in these hostile states oppose abortion and have an established history of passing extreme abortion restrictions including six-week abortion bans that strip access before many people even know theyre pregnant. Existing Abortion Restrictions Hurt People With Low Incomes the Most For many people, Roe v. Wade is ALREADY meaningless. In the past decade, states have passed hundreds of abortion restrictions that make safe, legal abortion out of reach for people who cant overcome unfair and costly barriers such as long distance travel to get to the closest abortion provider, or taking time off work because of medically unnecessary two-trip requirements. The restrictions harm people with low incomes and Black and Brown people, and all women who are forced to navigate racist and discriminatory systems. After the Senate confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year, 12 states passed 25 abortion bans. Although all of these laws are blocked by lower courts, some are making their way up through the appeals process. Since 2011, states have passed more than 480 abortion restrictions such as mandatory waiting periods, two-trip requirements, bans on insurance coverage, and telehealth abortion bans. These restrictions make it more difficult, and often or impossible, for people with low incomes and communities of color to access the care they need. Now, five states in the U.S. have only one abortion provider left Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Take Action for Justice Email Your Senators!

Key points include:
	1.	Barrett’s Stance on Abortion: Barrett has a history of opposing reproductive rights. Her writings, speeches, and rulings suggest she would likely vote to restrict abortion access, endangering women’s health care and reproductive freedom for generations.
	2.	Impact on Abortion Access: If Barrett is confirmed and Roe v. Wade is overturned, states would have the power to decide abortion legality. Ten states, especially in the South, Midwest, and Mountain West, have “trigger laws” that would automatically ban abortion if Roe is struck down. Additionally, 17 cases are pending before the Supreme Court that could impose restrictions that would limit abortion access without directly overturning Roe.
	3.	State-Level Restrictions: Twenty states already have a mix of trigger laws, pre-Roe bans, and legislatures hostile to abortion rights. These states have passed restrictive measures, such as six-week bans, which could eliminate abortion access before many people realize they are pregnant. This trend has disproportionately affected low-income and people of color, who face additional barriers to accessing care.
	4.	Ongoing Impact of Restrictions: Even under Roe v. Wade, many states have passed laws that create obstacles to abortion access, such as mandatory waiting periods, travel requirements, and limitations on insurance coverage. These laws have made abortion increasingly inaccessible for people with low incomes and those from marginalized communities. Five states now only have one abortion provider remaining.

The article concludes by urging readers to take action and contact their senators to oppose Barrett’s confirmation, citing concerns about the long-term consequences for reproductive rights and justice."
"Before She Died, ‚ÄúJane Roe‚Äù Said She Was Never Really Pro-Life: Does It Matter? | Michael C.

Dorf Tweet Share Posted in Philosophy and Ethics In the 1996 satirical film Citizen Ruth, Laura Dern brilliantly portrayed Ruth Stoops, who irresponsibly uses drugs while pregnant. Stoops finds herself in jail with anti-abortion protesters. When they learn that the judge has effectively encouraged Stoops to end her pregnancy, the protesters enlist her in their cause. But Stoops proves to be a far from ideal spokesperson. She profanely asks whether the people at the pro-life clinic to which her new friends bring her are deaf, because she wants an abortion. Switching sides, she has no greater affinity for the pro-choice activists who later enlist her to their cause. Stoops is happy to exploit everyone who seeks to exploit her. She is looking out for herself alone. Life imitates art. Last week, FX premiered AKA Jane Roe, a documentary on the life of Norma McCorvey, the woman who was the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade. The twists and turns are breathtaking. In early 1970, McCorvey sought an abortion, telling the doctor to whom she went that she had become pregnant as a result of a rape. Many years later, she revealed that the rape allegation was untrue, a fabrication designed to enable her to obtain an abortion. Why McCorvey thought the lie would work is unclear, given that the Texas law forbidding abortion contained only one exceptionto save the womans life. In any event, the rape allegation played no role in the Supreme Courts Roe decision, but, as a pro-choice activist says in AKA Jane Roe, McCorveys acknowledgment of the lie damaged her as a spokesperson. Nonetheless, for a time McCorvey was an outspoken advocate for legal abortion, but only for a time. After she was befriended by pro-life activists, she was born again, switched sides, recanted, and became a prominent spokesperson for overturning Roe. The big reveal comes near the end of AKA Jane Roe. In what she describes as a deathbed confession, McCorvey says she took the pro-life organizations money and said what they wanted her to say but indicates that she was always still pro-choice. As shown by tax documents, McCorvey was paid close to half a million dollars by pro-life individuals and organizations. Why Individual Stories Dont Matter Where McCorveys acknowledgment that she fabricated the rape allegation and her religious rebirth were a publicity boon to the pro-life movement, so it seems her deathbed confession will benefit the pro-choice side. Yet, as a strictly legal matter, none of McCorveys statements or views should have any relevance to the legal status of abortion. For one thing, it is purely an accident of history that McCorvey was the plaintiff in the precedent-setting case in the Supreme Court. The lawyers who brought Roe to the CourtSarah Weddington and Linda Coffeehad been actively looking for suitable plaintiffs, as were other feminist lawyers. The very pseudonymous nature of the case underscores that the actual identity of the woman seeking an abortion was unimportant. And of course, as McCorvey herself recounts in AKA Jane Roe, the Supreme Courts 1973 ruling did nothing directly for her. By that time, she had given birth and given up her baby for adoption. Although the Roe decision begins with an explanation that the case is not moot because Roe could become pregnant again, the case was really about women generally, not any particular woman. That observation holds in just about every case the Supreme Court hears. Constitutional courts in many other countries have the power to hear so-called abstract cases that test the constitutionality of a law in the absence of any particular dispute. No federal court has that formal power, but unofficially, the Supreme Court uses concrete cases chiefly as a mechanism for addressing broad general questions. Unlike lower courts, which must hear whatever cases are brought within their jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has nearly complete discretion over its docket, allowing it to choose those concrete cases that have significance beyond the particular parties. Moreover, the parties whose cases give rise to important rules of law can be unsavory characters. Criminals are the typical protagonists in cases establishing the rights of law-abiding citizens against unreasonable police tactics. Neo-Nazis and Klansmen have won cases guaranteeing principles of free speech that protect civil rights protesters. As often as not, the Supreme Court makes constitutional law despite, rather than because of, a partys particular story. How Stories Nonetheless Matter And yet, it would be a mistake to conclude that the underlying stories are completely irrelevant. As the editor of a book that tells the back stories of landmark constitutional law cases, I could hardly think otherwise. Although the Supreme Court establishes general principles, by doing so only in concrete cases it gives effect to a particular and sensible understanding of law as something more than simply words on a page. If you want to know whether a law is constitutional, you will want to know what the law means, but what it means will be determined in substantial measure by how it applies in practice. For example, the Court is now considering the constitutionality of a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Four years ago the Court invalidated a nearly identical Texas law. Louisiana argues, among other things, that its law works sufficiently differently from the Texas law so as not to unduly burden the abortion right. Whether that claim is persuasive should turn on the actual facts, not on hypothetical examples or fiction. Perhaps the most shocking part of the final twist in McCorveys story is the hypocrisy it reveals. For years, the pro-life movement has defamed doctors who perform abortions and the workers and clinics who support them by portraying abortion as a money-making industry, even though people who perform or assist in abortions typically have more lucrative and safer alternative ways to make a living. Yet it turns out that a key pro-life spokesperson was actually in it for the money. In light of McCorveys story, the defamatory claims of greedy abortion doctors can be seen as an exercise in projectionparalleling the constant projection one sees from Donald Trump, who is also famous for his constant lying. Now more than ever, truth should matter. Coping with Complexity To say that truth should be preferred to lies is not to deny that the truth is sometimes messy. Was Norma McCorvey pro-choice, then pro-life, then pro-choice again? Was she pro-choice all along? Or were her substantive views about abortion always somewhat inchoate and less relevant to her than how she felt activists in each respective movement treated heras AKA Jane Roe implies? The documentary raises as many questions as it answers. If McCorveys religious conversion was only for show so she could get paid, why did it lead to the breakup of her long-term lesbian partnership based on church teaching against homosexuality? Even years after the breakup, it is painfully clear that McCorvey still loved Connie Gonzalez. Did she sell away not only her pro-choice beliefs but also the love of her life? And why? We will likely never know, but that fact, which heightens the poignancy of McCorveys personal story, does not undermine the authority of the case that bears her pseudonym. Consider another landmark case, Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated a law criminalizing homosexual sodomy. Justice Kennedys stirring opinion portrayed sexual intimacy as but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring, and so it often is. Yet as Professor Dale Carpenter discovered in researching his 2012 book Flagrant Conduct, the protagonists in Lawrence were not in a lasting relationship with one another and probably did not have sex with one another. Their lawyers acknowledged that they were never poster people. Neither was McCorveyfor any cause. Carpenter offers an insightful observation about Lawrence that could apply equally to Roe and McCorvey. The case, he writes in all its emotional, social, and legal complexity, is a reflection of life itself. People do indeed lead complex lives. They fall in love, cheat, lie, drink. None of this makes them any less entitled, as Justice Kennedy put it, to respect for their private lives. If it were otherwise, there would be very few peoplegay or straightentitled to liberty.

Company Terms of Service Privacy Policy 2024","Michael C. Dorf’s article discusses the complexities of Norma McCorvey’s life, focusing on her role in the landmark case Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the U.S. McCorvey, the woman behind the pseudonym “Jane Roe,” initially sought an abortion but later became an anti-abortion activist. This shift was not just ideological but financially motivated, as McCorvey was paid by pro-life organizations to publicly advocate for their cause. At the time of her death, McCorvey revealed in a documentary that she was still pro-choice, suggesting that she had been acting in accordance with the pro-life movement’s wishes rather than her true beliefs.

Dorf points out that while McCorvey’s personal story is intriguing, it does not directly affect the legal significance of Roe v. Wade, which was about a broader constitutional issue—whether laws banning abortion were constitutional. McCorvey’s story, while dramatic, should not alter the legal precedent set by the case, which has broader implications for women’s rights and reproductive freedoms.

The article also addresses the tendency to project personal motivations onto others, citing McCorvey’s hypocrisy about the anti-abortion movement’s portrayal of abortion providers as greedy. Dorf compares McCorvey’s personal contradictions to those of other significant legal cases, such as Lawrence v. Texas, highlighting the fact that personal lives are often messy but should not detract from legal principles.

In the end, Dorf argues that while personal stories are important in understanding the human aspects of legal cases, the legal decisions themselves are based on broader principles that should remain unaffected by the complexities of an individual’s life. The article also highlights the larger theme that people’s lives, including McCorvey’s, are often more complicated than they may appear in the public narrative, yet this complexity does not diminish their legal rights."

Credit Stephen Spillman for The Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. The high court vacated two rulings from the lower U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that sided with Texas GOP officials arguing that Gov. Greg Abbotts March 2020 executive order prohibited abortion under all but a few narrow circumstances in an attempt to preserve medical resources for COVID-19 patients. Abortion providers have said that the procedure rarely requires hospital time and typically does not involve extensive personal protective equipment. The executive order ended over the summer, allowing abortions in the state to resume, but Planned Parenthood has said leaving the lower court rulings on the books would set harmful legal precedent for abortion rights advocates. In a statement, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lawyering Project called Abbotts order a transparent attempt to chip away at access to reproductive health care by exploiting a public health crisis, and said it was important we took this procedural step to make sure bad case law was wiped from the books, according to a NBC News report. After Abbott paused all non-urgent medical procedures and surgeries to slow the spread of COVID-19 and conserve medical equipment, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the order should include a ban on most abortions, setting off a barrage of conflicting court rulings that created confusion for clinics and women seeking to end their pregnancies. Many Texans left the state to receive abortions during that time, a new study found earlier this year.

This ban, introduced by Governor Greg Abbott in March 2020, aimed to conserve medical resources during the COVID-19 pandemic by restricting abortions, allowing them only in limited circumstances. Texas officials, including Attorney General Ken Paxton, argued that the ban was necessary to prioritize healthcare resources, while abortion providers countered that abortions rarely require extensive medical resources.

The executive order eventually ended in the summer of 2020, permitting abortions to resume. However, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health advocates argued that the lower court rulings, which upheld the ban, could set a dangerous legal precedent for future abortion restrictions. By vacating the rulings, the Supreme Court ensured that this precedent would not remain on the books. The decision came after widespread confusion and disruption for clinics and patients, with many Texans seeking abortions out of state during the ban. Reproductive rights organizations praised the Supreme Court’s action, condemning Abbott’s executive order as a transparent effort to restrict access to abortion under the guise of a public health crisis."

Photo UN WomenRyan Brown CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 In order to address existing inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic, companies should make a serious effort in reducing the gender pay gap, upholding maternity provisions, tackling gender bias, and reducing gender-based violence and harassment. By Layanna Martin Neel Gammelgrd Do you know that a womans right to decide over her own body and her access to family planning methods and information are key determinants of whether she enters and stays in the labour market? And do you know that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, revealing that womens right to health, decent work, and equal participation in society are closely connected? Many people in the business community do not necessarily see a correlation between sexual and reproductive health and rights SRHR, womens labor force participation, and decent work. Moreover, with the 10-year countdown to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals SDG, there is a need to build a collective conscience about the importance of womens right to health, including their SRHR, if the global community is to deliver on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Inequality - a barrier to womens equal participation Structural inequality leads to poor access to health information and services for women, such as family planning, female hygiene products, medical care, and workplace health insurance catering for their reproductive needs. These become major barriers to womens equal participation in paid work, economic empowerment, and agency. Globally, one in three women will experience gender-based violence, including at work, and women remain underpaid and underrepresented across management levels. The private sector has a significant role to play in ushering in a Decade of Action on womens equal rights. As manifested in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the recent guidance on its Gender Dimensions, companies have a clear-cut responsibility to respect womens human rights, including their right to health. Globally, one in three women will experience gender-based violence, including at work, and women remain underpaid and underrepresented across management levels. Luckily, workplace investments in health and gender equality are not a zero-sum game, but an investment in the core-business itself. A growing body of evidence reveals that companies that invest in gender equality and health in the workplace achieve reduced levels of absenteeism, greater job satisfaction and employee engagement, as well as improvements in efficiency, productivity, and financial performance. However, to achieve these benefits, companies must adopt a strategic and long-term view to mainstream gender in the business. To a greater extent, companies need to identify and address gender-related risks that negatively impact womens right to health and wellbeing, and their equal participation at work. For example, companies should develop and implement gender-sensitive policies and practices to create an enabling work environment for women. A simple case in point is to ensure that women workers in particular can access maternity leave without fear of losing their job. Companies should also implement recruitment and hiring practices that reduce gender stereotypes, bias, and barriers to womens labour force participation. They should also collect sex-disaggregated data on pay and promotions to close the gender-pay gap and to support womens access to the talent pipeline. To ensure decent work, companies should protect expectant mothers from exposure to hazardous chemicals or heavy lifting at work, provide paid parental leave in line with national labor laws, and identify and combat sexual harassment in line with the International Labour Organizations ILO global standard, C190 on violence and harassment in the world of work. In addition, companies should implement effective grievance mechanisms in accordance with UNGP 31 e.g. a non-judicial grievance mechanism that is equitable, legitimate, and rights compatible. Mainstreaming gender in business an example from East Africa In Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia, barriers to womens health and rights at work are widespread. Many women working in the textile, floriculture, and manufacturing industries report miscarriages due to heavy lifting at work job loss due to pregnancy employers withholding pay during maternity leave sexual harassment in the workplace and being forced to spend the night in the workplace to complete orders. In addition, women have reported excessive working hours, few breaks, and wages well below the living-wage, which all result in a limited opportunity for these women to access and afford health services, and engage in decent work that delivers a fair income. These violations are compounded by the fact that national labour inspectors are underfunded, few, and have limited capacity to ensure oversight and accountability on part of companies. To address these challenges, the Danish Family Planning Association has established partnerships with several vocal business associations Federation of Uganda Employers, Federation of Kenya Employers, and Ethiopia Horticulture Producer Exporters Association and civil society partners such as Reproductive Health Uganda, Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia, and Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions. Together, we improve workers' access to SRHR information and services and work to mainstream health, including SRHR, and gender equality in the core business of companies and farms. We also advocate jointly for revisions of existing labour laws to include gender dimensions e.g. that companies should be legally required to provide lactating women access to safe and private breastfeeding rooms at the workplace to maintain womens participation in the labour market. We also advocate for greater labour oversight to strengthen implementation of existing labour law. Working in-depth with committed companies and farms allows us to gradually build and promote the best practices needed to advocate for structural change in the region. By leveraging Occupational Health and Safety OHS as our strategic inroad, we can tap into formal and well-established workplace structures to further mainstream a gender lens to health and equality. In other words, we integrate health and gender aspects in existing OHS systems for instance concerning womens security in the workplace. Apart from raising awareness of basic human and labour rights and relevant ILO conventions such as C100 on equal Remuneration and C190 among employers and employees, we demonstrate how SRHR and gender equality issues such as maternal health, access to contraceptives, right to parental leave, and prevention of gender-based violence are critical to business operations and employee retention. This approach fosters a greater understanding of the business relevance of gender-sensitive policies, workplace practices and grievance mechanisms among senior managers and within OHS committees. In this way, we contribute to the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, the improvement of hygiene practices, and the creation of a safer work environment for women. Central to our strategy is to build a Coalition of the Willing. This constitutes working closely with companies that are willing to invest in SRHR and gender equality in their business operations to create a more inclusive and safe work environment. Working in-depth with committed companies and farms allows us to gradually build and promote the best practices needed to advocate for structural change in the region. Our collaboration with East African business associations is instrumental in our ability to engage companies across Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia, secure their commitment, and establish the evidence base needed to drive change at scale. Gender-responsive private sector needed This past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated the extent to which inequalities and power hierarchies exist in society. In fact, the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequality, skewed power dynamics, and left the most vulnerable workers in labour intensive industries such as manufacturing, accommodation and food, as well as wholesale and retail trade without an income or security. According to McKinsey and UN Women, women workers are overrepresented when it comes to layoffs and loss of livelihood, and they also face increased risks of gender-based violence due to economic and social stressors. At the same time, workers poor access to water and sanitation in the workplace and at home has become a real risk in the local fight against COVID-19. In light of these challenges that exist in East Africa and other regions in the Global South, the post-pandemic reality calls for a thorough assessment of the gendered effects of COVID-19 in the private sector and serious efforts to mainstream SRHR and gender equality in business strategy, policies, and practices to create decent work for all. A first step towards creating this reality requires that companies invest in universal, gender-responsive, social protection systems to reduce womens income insecurity. Next, companies should support womens access to flexible work arrangements and to affordable, quality childcare services which would reduce attrition of working women, and enable women to re-enter the labor market. Among other things, companies should make a serious effort to reduce existing inequalities by reducing the gender-pay gap, upholding maternity provisions, tackling gender bias and pervasive undervaluation of work carried out by women, and reducing gender-based violence and harassment at work to support womens economic empowerment, health and well-being.

It argues that companies must recognize and address gender inequalities, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has worsened existing disparities. Specifically, the article calls for businesses to focus on sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR), including family planning and maternity leave, as essential to women’s ability to enter and remain in the workforce.

Key points highlighted include:
	1.	Structural Inequality and Barriers: Many women face poor access to health services, including family planning and reproductive health, which limits their economic participation and empowerment. Additionally, gender-based violence, underpayment, and underrepresentation in leadership roles persist globally.
	2.	Business Responsibility: Companies have a responsibility to respect and uphold women’s human rights, including providing health services and creating supportive work environments. This includes ensuring maternity leave without job loss, offering paid parental leave, addressing sexual harassment, and closing the gender pay gap.
	3.	Benefits of Gender Equality in the Workplace: The article stresses that investments in gender equality lead to improved employee satisfaction, lower absenteeism, higher productivity, and better financial performance. Companies need to adopt long-term strategies that integrate gender-sensitive policies.
	4.	Examples from East Africa: The article provides examples from Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia, where women in industries like textiles and manufacturing face issues such as miscarriages due to unsafe working conditions, job loss during maternity leave, and sexual harassment. Collaborations between business associations and civil society organizations are helping address these issues by promoting access to SRHR services and advocating for legal reforms.
	5.	Post-Pandemic Challenges: The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected women workers, leading to layoffs and increased risks of gender-based violence. The article calls for a gender-responsive approach in post-pandemic recovery efforts, including universal social protection systems, flexible work arrangements, and quality childcare services to reduce women’s income insecurity and support their return to work.
	6.	Actionable Steps for Companies: To promote gender equality, companies should implement gender-sensitive policies, offer maternity and parental leave, tackle gender bias, and ensure equal pay. They should also focus on creating a safer work environment, reduce gender-based violence, and support women’s health and well-being.

In summary, the article argues that women’s health and gender equality are integral to achieving sustainable development and business success. By adopting inclusive policies and investing in gender equality, businesses can create better work environments and contribute to global gender equity."

The US invasion and subsequent conflict there has undermined maternal health, limited the accessibility and quality of maternal healthcare, and created serious generational trauma in the form of undesired pregnancies and mental health disorders. Decades of foreign intervention and civil war have destroyed healthcare infrastructure, while the lingering neocolonial patriarchal society and Taliban fear tactics have limited access to necessary sexual health education. Developing a sustainable maternal healthcare system is an integral step to achieving transformative justice for Afghan women and for the development of Afghanistans social institutions amid the ongoing peace process. A multisectoral approach is required to sustain responsible governmental, international, and regional coordination to create educational programs centered around the sexual and reproductive health of women and to initiate systemic action to reverse the ability of male-centric structures to withhold reproductive healthcare. Healthcare infrastructure Afghanistan suffers from the absence of government institutions supporting healthcare, which is felt especially hard in maternal healthcare. The Afghan region of Badakhshan recorded the highest maternal mortality ratio in history in 2001. The nexus between maternal health, mental health, and non-communicable diseases goes unnoticed in the Ministry of Public Healths Basic Package of Health Services BPHS, leading pregnant Afghan women to suffer high rates of postpartum depression and infections. The overdependence on international non-governmental organizations INGOs also contributes to Afghanistans faltering healthcare infrastructure. INGO funding can often be short-term and ephemeral, and when it disappears, it often leaves behind a healthcare system with no other form of financial support and exacerbates the incoordination of womens healthcare at the provincial and national level. In the long term, service delivery should not depend on INGOs but rather the Ministry of Public Health and domestic partners. While INGOs have been the main source of immediate healthcare relief in the form of service delivery, this temporary relief cannot sustain poor government healthcare services and the development of local services has been severely stunted. While one cannot downplay the importance of NGO emergency relief, structural change for Afghanistan will only materialize once the government invests more in its own healthcare framework and reduces its dependency on emergency INGO service delivery. Hospitals and clinics outside of Kabul are given even less resources and aid. Deficiencies in antenatal care ANC, delivery assistance by skilled birth attendants SBA, and utilization of postnatal care PNC have led to maternal health coverage blackouts within the outermost provinces. Afghanistans lack of accessibility and quality of care jeopardizes the safety of labor procedures for pregnant women as well as access to STD screening and abortion capacity, which is the backbone of womens rights in the Global South. Policy recommendations for healthcare infrastructure In order to catalyze true transformative justice in Afghanistan, the Afghan government ought to implement a multisectoral approach with women at the forefront to improve the social determinants of health. Namely, this must include cross-coordination between the Ministry of Public Health and higher education, which is imperative to prioritizing maternal health educational resources and preparing hospitals for the unique challenges women face. The development of a sustainable healthcare infrastructure is critical to reduce dependence on INGOs and is only attainable with the subsidization of costs and substantial investment from the international community. This investment should be in the form of a consistent monitoring and evaluation system that has the technological capacity to link all local NGOs, healthcare providers, and facilities. As such, even if INGO relief dwindles, there will be an internationally-supported domestic network in place ensuring a consistent flow of patient care. This is only possible via investment in Afghan NGOs as well as in Afghanistans actual healthcare system. After two decades of armed conflict, Afghanistans medical infrastructure and healthcare workers have been caught in the crossfire. As such, the United States and its allies have a responsibility to invest in organizations supporting local infrastructure that would tangibly improve Afghan lives. The Community Midwifery Education Initiative CMEI is an example of a localized program that needs investment to train local women to become midwives and provide comprehensive maternal healthcare. Investing in local infrastructure ensures long-term wellness for women and overall development of Afghan social institutions. In addition, Central and South Asian actorsnamely Pakistanmay be more effective in supporting Afghanistans local talent within its own healthcare system. Pakistans efforts to facilitate Afghanistans stabilization could perhaps include capacity building programs administered by Pakistani maternal medical professionals, helping to harness womens empowerment. Sexual education and empowerment Limited access to sexual education has for decades disproportionately impacted womens wellness at the cost of their safety. True transformative justice for Afghan women cannot come without sexual and reproductive health literacy for all Afghans. With the exception of abortion, there is no formal legislation outlawing the use of birth control, including contraceptives. Contraceptive availability and usage, however, varies by province depending on the family planning educational programs available. Typically, male mullahs in the rural and more conservative provinces tend to oppose the implementation of family planning and sexual literacy programs, making women there even more vulnerable. Scarce sexual education has impeded awareness around contraceptives and family planning, which directly hinders improved birth spacing and seeking out a skilled birth attendant to postpone pregnancies with premature pelvic development and reducing the perils associated with high parity pregnancies. Policy recommendations for sexual education Afghan men and women are entitled to sexual and reproductive health resources, as they have a right to protect their bodies and empower themselves in the spirit of restorative justice and reclaiming their sexual rights. Streamlined access to sexual education and female presence in obstetrics and gynecology are essential for improving family planning and reproductive health services. An estimated thirty three percent of maternal deaths could be prevented annually if women had assured access to contraceptives and maternal health resources. As women gain access to educational resources, they readily seek out necessary prenatal care to prevent obstetric emergencies that typically harm maternal health. Female health professionals are ideal facilitators of trust in sexual education, urging investment in community midwifery centers, especially those in the outermost provinces of Afghanistan. Access to family planning and reproductive health services is critical to improve and uplift the lives of hundreds of thousands of Afghan women and children. Neocolonial derived patriarchy and Taliban fear tactics Complicit in sustaining an imperialist system inherited from the colonial British, the Soviet Union, and the United States, Afghan men have derived power from family honor codes, which allows them to dominate political positions, tribal councils known as Jirgas, and family units. Husbands in particular often restrict women from attaining maternal care from a proper healthcare facility. In addition, Afghan women are traditionally prevented from visiting healthcare facilities if there are no female staff, especially in cases related to fertility and reproductive health. The status of a womans right to maternal healthcare is thus not only limited by availability and affordability, but also by social norms and whether treatments are sensitive to cultural and religious beliefs. These very codes perpetuate practices of early marriage, honor killings, and bride kidnappings, enforcing gender violence and structural injustice for women throughout their lives. While the state of maternal health was already crippled under the Taliban emirates mangled understanding of womens rights in Islamic and ethnic contexts, the US invasion escalated violence and enshrined male-dominated power structures, heightening womens apprehension to seek reproductive care. Despite the Talibans consistent record of egregious attacks on healthcare workers and facilities, the introduction of US and NATO troops has led to an uptick in violent confrontations with the Taliban, now engendering hostility towards any healthcare facility associated with externally supported medical care. Concurrently, the United States victimized the archetype of the Afghan woman to justify sustained bombing campaigns which disproportionately killed and injured more women. Despite increased humanitarian aid from the United States, the uptick in violence has caused INGO-operated maternity wards to close their doors out of concern for hospital staff safety, further restricting healthcare access for women. At the outset of the US intervention in Afghanistan, coverage rates for reproductive, maternal, and child care improved. Twenty-one of the thirty-four provinces witnessed twenty-percent increases in the percentage of women cared for by a skilled birth attendant from pre-US intervention levels. Yet, these gains remain unequally distributed, particularly for the more remote and poor provinces controlled by the Taliban. Moreover, experts in maternal mortality assert that the enormous declines in maternal mortality after the US-led invasion reported by USAID are improbable. As such, even with US intervention, maternal care outreach endures serious threats in Taliban controlled and contested regions with reproductive empowerment out of reach for women living in these areas. Despite some maternal health indicators improving under US humanitarian aid, the highly patriarchal set of systems and ideologies brought on by the United States in an attempt to stabilize the country produced an unhealthy dichotomy between modernists and religious-based traditionalists, in additionto enabling existing local attitudes about gender and power. After the US and NATO-sponsored Bonn agreement to initiate Afghanistans rebuilding, Pashtun women, especially in Northern Afghanistan, suffered from the trauma of sexual violence at the hands of tribal warlords empowered by the fall of the Taliban. Although the United States boasted its defeat of the Talibans formal gender repressive policies, it fails to acknowledge the gender apartheid it nurtured as it empowered the pre-existing gender attitudes of warlords of the Northern Alliance to co-opt political processes and introduced the narrative of a sexually empowered woman being incompatible with Afghan and Islamic traditions. Policy recommendations for patriarchal norms Male leadership can no longer stand in the way of sexual empowerment and literacy for women and should abdicate more roles in government and local institutions to women. A significant step in this process would be the complete overhaul of the healthcare system to be geared toward womens health initiatives, led by revolutionary women and organizations like RAWA, as active participants rather than a western token. In order to circumvent reproductive coercion and backlash from jirgas, shurascommittees that largely influence community-wide health initiativescan and must advocate for the participation of midwives to disseminate preventative health information. Although contraceptive use may need to be normalized, men must re-evaluate their role in sex and, as beneficiaries of a global power-structure in which women are objectified and violated by male sexual ego, transform their perceptions of the sexual rights of women. As such, co-educational programs are critical for men and women to unlearn the fallacies surrounding womens health and family planning. In order to target the complicity of men, educational programs must tap into radical social revolution, forcing them to reconsider the harms they have unintentionally or intentionally caused to womens hygiene, sexual health, and wellness. A severely under-supported foundation for adequate maternal care calls for more international and domestic investment and greater emphasis on sexual education. At the same time, informal and formal patriarchal structures need to be demolished to neutralize the threats women face in every aspect of their existence, including their right to healthcare. In order to attain equality for every Afghan citizen, it is imperative that Afghan women are centered at every conversation to defuse a system riddled with male ego.

Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Terms and conditions of use Intellectual Independence Policy Government Funding Review Process Policy on donor acceptance and disclosure Modern Day Slavery and Anti-Human Trafficking Policy Photo credits","The maternal healthcare system in Afghanistan has faced significant challenges, worsened by decades of conflict, socio-political instability, and limited access to services. The US invasion, ongoing civil wars, and the return of the Taliban have further undermined healthcare infrastructure, particularly in the areas of maternal health, mental health, and sexual education. These issues are compounded by deep-seated patriarchal and cultural barriers that restrict women’s access to reproductive care.

Key Issues:
	1.	Healthcare Infrastructure: Afghanistan’s healthcare system, especially in maternal health, suffers from a lack of government support and reliance on international NGOs (INGOs), whose short-term funding cannot sustain long-term improvements. The maternal mortality rate remains high, with regions like Badakhshan reporting some of the highest levels. The country’s healthcare system is plagued by poor coordination, especially in rural areas, where access to skilled birth attendants and postnatal care is severely limited.
	2.	Policy Recommendations for Healthcare Infrastructure: A sustainable, locally driven healthcare model is essential for long-term success. This includes investing in Afghan NGOs and strengthening the Ministry of Public Health’s capacity to deliver healthcare. Developing local talent, such as midwives through programs like the Community Midwifery Education Initiative (CMEI), would help ensure consistent healthcare delivery. International investment should focus on creating a monitoring and evaluation system to integrate local and international efforts, even as INGO support dwindles.
	3.	Sexual Education and Empowerment: Limited access to sexual education has contributed to high rates of unwanted pregnancies, early marriages, and maternal health complications. Family planning programs and access to contraception are critical for improving women’s health. In rural areas, male religious leaders often oppose such programs, deepening the vulnerability of women. Providing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education, especially for women, is essential for improving birth spacing, reducing maternal mortality, and empowering women to make informed choices.
	4.	Patriarchal and Cultural Barriers: Afghanistan’s deeply ingrained patriarchal norms, often upheld by male-dominated political and social structures, limit women’s autonomy over their health. Social norms, such as restrictions on women seeking care from male doctors or the prevalence of honor-based violence, further hinder access to maternal healthcare. The Taliban’s return has exacerbated these challenges, with women fearing retaliation for seeking care at Western-backed facilities, which they associate with foreign influence and Western values.
	5.	Policy Recommendations for Challenging Patriarchy: To address these cultural barriers, male leadership must be held accountable and women should be empowered to take more active roles in the healthcare system. This includes advocating for the inclusion of women in decision-making roles and reforming healthcare policies to center women’s needs. Co-educational programs for both men and women are essential to change societal attitudes toward women’s health and reproductive rights.

Conclusion: The improvement of Afghanistan’s maternal healthcare system requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both infrastructure and socio-cultural challenges. Sustainable investments in healthcare infrastructure, sexual education, and gender equality are necessary for creating a healthcare system that meets the needs of Afghan women and children, ultimately contributing to long-term peace and development in the country."

The symbols of Poland‚Äôs abortion protests explained | Notes From Poland,"The symbols of Polands abortion protests explained Notes From Poland News Insights Po polsku Topics Politics Society Culture Business History Education Energy Climate Law Media Podcasts Notes from Poland Podcast The VoiCEE podcast About us Our story Editorial team Advisory Board Notes from Poland Foundation Contact Newsletters Notes from Poland Newsletter Central and Eastern Europe Newsletter Select Page The symbols of Polands abortion protests explained Oct 30, 2020 Explainers, Politics, Society By Agnieszka Wdoowska Since last weeks constitutional court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland, the country has witnessed eight consecutive days of mass protests that are believed to be the largest since the fall of communism in 1989. Much of the demonstrators anger has been directed not against the court itself, but rather towards the Catholic church and ruling national-conservative Law and Justice PiS party, who are seen as being behind the ruling. As hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets, many have displayed symbols that have come to characterise the protests. Below, we explain the meaning and history behind six of the most common. Red lightning bolt A red lightning bolt has become the main symbol of the protests. It is part of the logo of Womens Strike Strajk Kobiet, a grassroots womens rights initiative and the main organiser of the current demonstrations. It was originally created by graphic designer Ola Jasionowska, who says that it symbolises a warning. It says watch out, beware, we wont accept that women are being deprived of their basic rights, Jasionowska explained to Newsweek Polska. Nigdy ju adna nie bdzie sza sama. Bdziemy szy razem. Bdziemy walczy o polskie kobiety i przestrzeganie praw czowieka na ulicy i w sejmie.

Ryszard Terlecki, head of PiSs parliamentary caucus and deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, said it was sad to see opposition MPs wearing facemasks referencing totalitarian symbols. News broadcasts on state TV, which is under the influence of PiS, have this week repeatedly referred to the protesters as left-wing fascists and drawn links between their symbol and Nazism. ""Leftist fascism is destroying Poland"" headlined the main evening news on state TV a government mouthpiece for the second night in a row. They said that abortion protesters have expressed ""approval of cannibalism"" and use a symbol associated with Nazism and Satan pic.twitter.com8Xufk66tih Daniel Tilles danieltilles1 October 28, 2020 Supporters of the protests point out that the Womens Strike logo is different in colour, shape and style to the SS insignia, and that lightning bolts are a common symbol for an array of different groups. Among those that have used such as symbol were the Grey Ranks, an underground Polish paramilitary organisation that resisted the German Nazi occupation in World War II. Those who link the lightning symbol to Nazism are insulting Polish heroes, said left-wing MP Anna-Maria ukowska. Jasionowska, the designer of the logo, says the claims of Nazi links are absurd It wasnt my intention at all. Everyone looks for interpretations that they find useful. Wypierdala and Solidarity One of the main slogans of the current protests has been Wypierdala, a vulgarity that translates roughly as Fuck off. The word has been chanted by demonstrators, while also appearing on posters and banners. Some quickly began to combine it with an iconic Polish symbol of protests and resistance, the logo of the Solidarity Solidarno trade union that played a leading role in bringing down communism in Poland in the 1980s. A court ruling that introduces a near total ban on abortion in Poland has brought tens of thousands of protesters mostly women onto the streets. We look at the protests through the lens of Italian photographer Luca Aliano Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 26, 2020 Artist Jarek Kubicki then developed that theme further by adapting a famous campaign poster from 1989, when Poland held its first semi-free elections, in which the Solidarity logo appeared behind an image of Gary Cooper appearing as a cowboy in the American Western High Noon. Kubicki recreated the poster, but with Solidarno replaced by Wypierdala and Gary Cooper replaced by female action heroes from Hollywood movies. The idea quickly spread, with many Polish women, including left-wing female MPs, creating similar images with themselves in the foreground. The designer of the original Solidarity logo, Jerzy Janiszewski, has previously said that he has no problem with abortion protesters using his work. As the author, I am opposed to prosecuting and punishing anyone for using the logo during peaceful and, in my opinion, legitimate protests for womens rights in Poland, he said in 2016. At the abortion protests, there have been many signs bearing eight asterisks in the form , in what may be a rather confusing and cryptic message for observers from outside Poland. The symbols widely referred to as eight little stars in Polish stand for Jeba PiS Fuck PiS. They became a widely used meme during this years presidential election campaign, especially after they appeared in the video for a song by Polish rapper Taco Hemingway that was seen as critical of the ruling party. In one famous image, President Andrzej Duda who was standing for re-election as the candidate supported by PiS unwittingly posed for a photo alongside a young man wearing a t-shirt bearing the eight stars.

Tens of thousands of Polish women, wearing black to symbolise mourning, came out onto the streets. Some of the largest demonstrations took place in the autumn rain, and as a result umbrellas became a symbol of the Black Protests.

But afterwards, organisers vowed Nie skadamy parasolek Were not closing our umbrellas. And since then, umbrellas have reappeared whenever a threat to womens reproductive rights is perceived. Earlier this year, another proposal to ban abortion returned to parliament during lockdown. With street protests prohibited, many women placed black umbrellas in their windows or balconies, or held black umbrellas while queuing outside of shops. Jak zaprotestowa, nie ruszajc si z domu?

It's not raining umbrellas are in Poland a symbol of protests against restricting abortion Notes from Poland notesfrompoland October 24, 2020 Coat hanger Coat hangers an international symbol of pro-choice protests have also been widespread during the current demonstrations in Poland, being both wielded by the protesters themselves and also hung on the doors or fences of churches and offices of right-wing politicians. The demonstrations taking place in the city of Wrocaw last Saturday were called the Night of the Coat Hanger Noc wieszaka. Protesters decorated the gate of the palace of the archbishop of Wrocaw with slogans and coat hangers as well as a chemise stained with blood. .ZieloniWro jak zawsze tam gdzie trzeba Dzi wsplnie z wrocawiankami i wrocawianami licznie spacerowali po Ostrowie Tumskim.

In Poland, which has the strictest abortion law in the EU other than Maltas, only around 1,000 legal abortions take place each year. But it is estimated that tens of thousands of women have illegal terminations annually, while many travel abroad for procedures in countries with more liberal laws. Artist Iness Rychlik has produced a self-portrait combining the coat hanger symbol with a blood stain in the shape of Poland. Her work is entitled Granice subtelnoci, with granice meaning both limits and borders and subtelnoci meaning of subtlety or of nicety.

Pin It on Pinterest Support us!","On Tuesday, over 1,000 people gathered at the Oklahoma State Capitol to support Senate Bill 13, a proposal introduced by Sen. Joseph Silk that aims to completely ban abortion in the state, with no exceptions, treating it as homicide and seeking to override the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision. The rally, organized by conservative religious groups, featured speeches, music, and discussions with lawmakers. Advocates, including Leslie Hanks, a Colorado abolitionist, argued that the pro-life movement is inadequate, advocating for a total ban on abortion. Amy Kelly, another supporter, emphasized the need to support women facing unwanted pregnancies.

In contrast, a smaller pro-choice rally was held to oppose the bill, with tensions rising between the two groups, prompting the presence of state troopers for security. Pro-choice organizer Susan Braselton voiced concerns about the erosion of women’s rights and criticized Oklahoma’s disregard for established court precedents.

Sen. Silk had introduced a similar bill the previous year, but it failed to gain traction due to lack of committee support. Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat, while opposing abortion, criticized SB 13, calling it flawed and more focused on challenging the U.S. Constitution than on saving lives. The bill remains stalled in the legislative process.

Rep. Forrest Bennett highlighted Oklahoma’s high infant and maternal mortality rates, suggesting that the state’s actions reflect a pro-birth stance rather than a genuine commitment to supporting life after birth. He called for improvements in the state’s approach to mothers and children."

REUTERSSandra Sebastian On International Womens Day, March 8, the Guatemalan Congress passed an extraordinarily regressive Life and Family bill that undermines the rights of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender LGBT people. President Alejandro Giammattei announced on March 10 that he would veto the law, noting that it violated international treaties. While outrage around the bill is justified and should continue, the bill also serves to divert attention from the pernicious dismantling of the rule of law that the government and its allies are currently undertaking. The far-reaching bill expands the criminalization of abortion and could subject women who have miscarriages to questioning by law enforcement authorities, or even prosecution. The new proposal defines abortion as the natural or provoked death of an embryo or fetus. It establishes prison sentences of up to four years for women who cause their own abortion, and 10 years for women who seek an abortion. Under current law, abortion is legal in Guatemala only when the life of a pregnant woman or girl is in danger. The proposal establishes that freedom of conscience and expression protects people from being forced to share or participate in non-heterosexual conduct and practices. The vagueness of this article appears aimed at legally protecting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, such as in housing, employment or service provision. The bill defines family as father, mother, and children, deliberately excluding the realities of diverse families and explicitly bans same-sex marriage and unions. The Life and Family bill represents an affront to comprehensive sexuality education as it bans schools from teaching about LGBT people and sexual and reproductive health rights, curtailing childrens and adolescents rights to education, information, and health. The passage of the bill, which had been stalled in Congress since 2018, is not just noteworthy for its flagrant violations of human rights, but also for its timing. In recent days, Attorney General Consuelo Porras issued a new round of arrest warrants for anti-corruption prosecutors from her own office who had been investigating the president and other high-level officials. Some prosecutors have resigned or fled the country. New corruption allegations against President Alejandro Giammattei also surfaced last month. These are just the latest in years of attacks on the rule of law that have left Guatemalas democratic institutions hanging by a thread. Since Giammattei took office in 2020, he has worked with Congress and Porras to block any remaining corruption investigations that implicated senior politicians, by attempting to remove the last few independent judges and packing the Constitutional Court. Moving the Life and Family bill forward now has left human rights activists scrambling to fight against backsliding on multiple important fronts. And this may very well be part of a pernicious strategy by conservative and corrupt officials at a time when corruption seems to be winning, even as the international community expresses concern and dissatisfaction. Indeed, the bill and other government initiatives appear to be designed to move the public debate in Guatemala away from the issues of corruption and judicial independence as they polarize the population on issues like abortion and LGBT rights. On March 9, a day after the Guatemalan Congress passed the bill, Giammattei took part in a Christian congress that declared Guatemala the pro-life capital of Ibero-America. And the Life and Family bill may not be the last one to be employed as a distraction tactic. Bill 5940, recently passed unanimously by a congressional commission, stigmatizes transgender people and limits information about their existence in schools. It also regulates information about trans people in media outlets. President Giammattei is right in saying that the Life and Family bill violates international law. His veto is a significant about-turn for a man who has a track record of supporting initiatives that threaten the rights of women and LGBT people. A risk remains that a two-thirds majority of Congress could overturn his decision. But whatever the ultimate outcome, the bill has already done harm by drawing attention away from endemic corruption and the erosion of the rule of law in Guatemala.

The bill significantly expands the criminalization of abortion, subjecting women who cause or seek abortions to prison sentences, even in cases of miscarriage. It also defines marriage strictly as between a man and a woman, bans same-sex unions, and curtails LGBTQ+ rights by forbidding schools from teaching about sexual and reproductive health or LGBTQ+ issues.

Although President Alejandro Giammattei expressed intentions to veto the bill, citing violations of international treaties, the bill has been used strategically by the government to divert attention from the ongoing corruption scandals and attacks on judicial independence. The bill’s timing coincided with new corruption allegations against Giammattei and the targeting of anti-corruption prosecutors. This diversion tactic, alongside the government’s suppression of corruption investigations, indicates a broader strategy to polarize the public on social issues like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, rather than focusing on governance and rule of law issues.

In addition to the Life and Family Bill, other legislative efforts, such as Bill 5940, have targeted transgender people, further contributing to a climate of discrimination and censorship. Giammattei’s veto, though significant, faces the risk of being overturned by Congress. Regardless of the final outcome, the bill has already shifted focus away from Guatemala’s systemic corruption, highlighting the government’s broader tactics to protect corrupt practices under the guise of defending “family values” and “pro-life” ideologies."

AP PhotoKarl B DeBlaker By GARY D. ROBERTSON and HANNAH SCHOENBAUM Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print RALEIGH, N.C. AP The North Carolina House on Wednesday approved a Republican package of abortion restrictions that would tighten the states ban on the procedure from after 20 weeks to after 12 weeks, while creating new exceptions but also more requirements for pregnant women and physicians.The fast-tracked legislation, which emerged the previous day after months of private negotiations among House and Senate GOP members, was scheduled to receive a final vote in the Senate on Thursday morning and could reach the desk of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper later that day. Cooper, a strong abortion-rights supporter, vowed to fight the measure.I will veto this extreme ban and need everyones help to hold it, Cooper said in a tweet. But Republicans now hold veto-proof majorities in both General Assembly chambers after a House Democrat switched to the Republican Party last month. That advantage was reflected in the Houses party-line 71-46 vote for the measure Wednesday night after an hour of debate. One Republican was absent for the vote. House Speaker Tim Moore said afterward that in his chamber we absolutely do have the votes for an override. READ MORE Abortion story from wife of Nevada Senate hopeful reveals complexity of issue for GOP candidates A new front opens over South Dakota ballot initiatives withdrawing signatures from petitions In a first, Vice President Harris visits Minnesota abortion clinic to blast immoral restrictions Earlier in the day, more than 200 people, including Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and members of Congress, rallied in opposition to the bill near the Legislative Building. Demonstrators later marched inside, and chanted Abortion Rights Now! from the House gallery during a break. State law currently bans almost all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill being considered would reduce that to 12 weeks, or roughly at the first trimester. It also places limits on new exceptions, capping abortions at 20 weeks in cases of rape or incest and 24 weeks for life-limiting fetal anomalies, including certain physical or genetic disorders that can be diagnosed prenatally. An existing exception for when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger would remain. The changes stem from the desire of state Republicans to alter abortion rules after last years U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. But they arent as restrictive as those in other GOP-controlled Southern states like Tennessee and West Virginia.Some conservatives had wanted a ban on abortions once an ultrasound first detects fetal cardiac activity, typically about six weeks after fertilization. But thats not where Republican lawmakers ended up.We talked about everything what went too far, what didnt go far enough and where we could finally come to a consensus was 12 weeks, said GOP Rep. Sarah Stevens of Surry County, one of the negotiators of the package.Republicans were cautious about going too far in a closely divided state ahead of the 2024 elections after losing some key races in suburban areas last year where abortion was a big issue, Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said.Certainly the tea leaves that came out of 2022s election showed that if they went too restrictive, there would be a political and electoral backlash, Bitzer said. Courtney Geels, grassroots director for the socially conservative group North Carolina Values Coalition, said the bill is a significant compromise in the pro-life community, but it is an excellent step in the right direction.Republicans also proposed spending in the bill at least 160 million for programs to improve child care access and maternal health care, encourage families to take in foster children and provide contraceptives to low-income or uninsured patients. The measure also includes money to cover eight weeks of paid leave for state employees and teachers after giving birth, with four weeks for another new parent.These are very significant, meaningful and much needed investments in children, families and women, said GOP Rep. Erin Par of Wake County, who also helped shepherd the measure on the House floor. The 46-page measure contains additional abortion prohibitions that Cooper vetoed successfully in past years when Democrats held more legislative seats. Some would bar women from getting abortions on the basis of race or a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Another would require doctors and nurses to protect and care for children born alive during a failed late-term abortion. The legislative package was offered through a parliamentary procedure that doesnt allow lawmakers to offer amendments. That angered Democrats who called the process to consider such a controversial and complex measure anti-democratic. Democrats demanded just before Wednesdays vote that they be able to lodge formal protests, citing a provision in the state constitution addressing an act that a lawmaker may think injurious to the public.The effort to cover up the stripping of a womans dignity and her right to bodily autonomy cannot be sugarcoated with this partial funding measure, said Rep. Laura Budd, a Mecklenburg County Democrat. The bill also creates new licensing requirements for surgical abortion clinics that must be at least as restrictive as the rules that ambulatory surgical centers must follow. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic says none of its clinics in the state currently meet those standards.Extreme anti-abortion politicians have created a monster by pushing new restrictions that aim to shut down abortion clinics, Planned Parenthood spokesperson Jillian Riley told lawmakers.North Carolina law currently requires a 72-hour waiting period for an abortion but allows for the clock to start ticking with a phone call between a pregnant woman and a physician or qualified professional. The bill would eliminate that remote contact option and require a woman visit a clinic or hospital in person, as well as a follow-up visit for a medically induced abortion. The extra visits result in an unnecessary burden, critics say, especially for women who find it hard to take off work.This bill is about making it as difficult as possible to obtain an abortion, even in the first trimester, Dr. Amy Bryant, an OB-GYN, said at Wednesdays rally.At least 88 of abortions in North Carolina in 2020 occurred at or before 12 weeks of gestation, according to state Department of Health and Human Services data. HANNAH SCHOENBAUM Schoenbaum is a government and politics reporter based in Salt Lake City, Utah. She also covers general news in the Rockies and LGBTQ rights policies in U.S. statehouses. mailto","The North Carolina House has approved a Republican-backed bill that seeks to tighten the state’s abortion laws. The legislation reduces the current ban on abortions from after 20 weeks to after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with certain exceptions. These exceptions include cases of rape or incest (up to 20 weeks), and life-limiting fetal anomalies (up to 24 weeks). It also maintains the exception for situations where the life of the pregnant woman is at risk.

The bill introduces new requirements for women seeking abortions and for physicians, including in-person visits for consultations and follow-ups, eliminating the option for remote consultations that previously initiated the 72-hour waiting period. It also mandates stricter licensing standards for abortion clinics, aligning them with those for ambulatory surgical centers. These provisions aim to make obtaining an abortion more difficult, critics argue.

Despite opposition from abortion rights groups and Democratic lawmakers, the bill passed the House with a 71-46 vote. Governor Roy Cooper, a staunch abortion-rights supporter, has vowed to veto the measure. However, the Republicans now have veto-proof majorities in the General Assembly, making an override likely.

Additionally, the bill includes $160 million in funding for programs aimed at improving maternal healthcare, child care, and family support services, including paid leave for state employees. While some conservatives see it as a compromise, critics argue that the bill’s restrictions are still too extreme."

But the full toll of this catastrophe has been incalculably greater. Health systems have been overwhelmed. Economies have been shuttered. And women and girls have been disproportionately affected, with sexual and reproductive health services being curtailed and gender-based violence on the rise. Today, 11 July, is World Population Day, a moment to raise awareness of the sexual and reproductive health needs of people around the world. This year, UNFPA is calling attention to the needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls amid the global pandemic, and the efforts needed to secure their health and human rights. No organization or country can do this alone, said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPAs Executive Director, in a statement. Heightened risks to women Around the world, women face a variety of heightened risks due to the pandemic. Front-line health workers the majority of whom are women face a direct risk of illness from COVID-19, for instance. But women and girls outside the health sector face serious risks, too. Those requiring sexual and reproductive health services may face anxiety about exposure to the virus while seeking care or they may forgo care entirely. Others have lost access to care all together due to movement restrictions and curbed health services. Many hospitals and health centres are reporting declines in the number of women and girls receiving critical sexual and reproductive health care, including antenatal services, safe delivery services and family planning. UNFPA and partners estimate that six months of significant health service disruptions could result in 47 million women in low- and middle-income countries going without contraceptives, leading to an additional 7 million unintended pregnancies. The number of maternal deaths is also expected to increase. UNFPA is working to ensure continued access to reproductive health services and supplies. In the Gambia, for instance, where the pandemic has reduced the number of women seeking health care, UNFPA is providing protective gear to health workers, improving community-level communications about the disease, and ensuring the continuation of family planning and midwifery programmes. Fatou Joof, a midwife at the UNFPA-supported Serrekunda Health Centre outside Banjul, expressed relief that she is able to continue providing maternal health care while using protective measures including face masks. ""When the women come to the facility, we make sure they wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water. We also make hand sanitizers available for use,"" she said. The work I do here brings me so much joy. This is who we are as midwives and this is what we do we save lives. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens women's access to reproductive health care, including family planning services, antenatal care and safe delivery services. Humanitarian settings Circumstances are even more harrowing in humanitarian settings. In Venezuela, shipments of medical supplies have been necessary to bolster the health system, which was already in crisis before the pandemic erupted. Humanitarian support was also essential for 19-year-old Afra Muhammad, in Syria, who faced life-threatening pregnancy complications in the Rukban displacement camp. UNFPA and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent arranged emergency transport for her a process that took two weeks of planning and two more weeks of travel. Finally, Afra arrived at the Family Planning Hospital in Homs, where she delivered a daughter via Caesarean section. Though she is relieved to have had a safe delivery, she remains fearful about COVID-19. I am so worried about my baby, and especially during the coronavirus pandemic, she told UNFPA. Elsewhere in Syria, women are reporting heightened levels of gender-based violence echoing a phenomenon seen globally. During the curfew period, I have met a lot of women who face violence by their husbands, said Ghadeer Mohammed Ibrahim Qara Bulad, director of the Womens Development Project at the Islamic Charitable Association. Digital platforms have become a way to reach vulnerable women with support, counselling and services responding to gender-based violence. Rising household tensions, exacerbated by economic pressures and movement restrictions, are sparking violence around the world. Women sheltering at home with their abusers often have nowhere to turn. And new forms of violence may be increasing, including cyber violence. On social media, there is a lot of bullying and violence directed at women in the light of the coronavirus crisis, Ms. Bulad told UNFPA. UNFPA estimates that six months of lockdowns could lead to 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence, and an additional 15 million more cases for every three months the lockdown continues. To make matters worse, access to shelters and in-person counselling has been limited by the pandemic. UNFPA and partners are working to continue services for survivors wherever possible, and to increase remote operations. But even this can be fraught. In Ukraine, experts say phone-based services are not enough. A phone call to the hotline itself can prompt partner aggression, said Alona Krivuliak, who runs a domestic violence hotline supported by UNFPA. Counsellors are finding new ways of working, including through silent platforms such as Viber and Facebook Messenger. Now some clients even tell us that this way of work is more suitable for them than visiting us, and they want to continue in such way even after quarantine ends, psychologist Tetyana Franchuk said. UNFPA programmes are also engaging men in the promotion of gender equality. The world must redouble all such efforts, Dr. Kanem said As the global community comes together in solidarity to survive this pandemic, we lay the foundation for more resilient, gender-equal societies and a healthier, more prosperous future for all.

Health systems have been overwhelmed, economies disrupted, and sexual and reproductive health services curtailed, leading to a rise in gender-based violence. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) highlights these issues on World Population Day, emphasizing the heightened risks women face, especially front-line health workers who are predominantly women.

The pandemic has caused a significant decline in access to reproductive health services, such as antenatal care, safe delivery services, and family planning, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. UNFPA estimates that six months of service disruptions could lead to 47 million women losing access to contraceptives, causing an additional 7 million unintended pregnancies. To mitigate this, UNFPA has worked to provide protective equipment to health workers, promote community-level health communication, and continue essential programs, such as midwifery services, in countries like the Gambia.

Humanitarian settings face even more severe challenges, as countries like Venezuela and Syria were already struggling with health crises before the pandemic. Women in these settings, such as Afra Muhammad in Syria, face life-threatening complications and delays in receiving critical care. The pandemic has also exacerbated gender-based violence, with lockdowns and economic pressures leading to rising violence in households worldwide. UNFPA predicts that the continuation of lockdowns could result in millions more cases of gender-based violence.

Efforts to support women through digital platforms and remote services are critical, but not always sufficient. In Ukraine, for instance, phone-based services can trigger further aggression from abusers, prompting counselors to explore safer communication channels like silent platforms. Despite these challenges, UNFPA continues to engage men in promoting gender equality, reinforcing the need for global solidarity and a commitment to creating more resilient and gender-equal societies."

Hall had a nonviable pregnancy and had to leave the state in order to terminate, revealing gaps in the states miscarriage exception after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Credit Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribunes daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Five Texas women who say they were denied medically necessary abortions are suing the state, seeking to clarify when the procedure is permissible under state law. They are joined in the lawsuit by two OB-GYNs who say widespread confusion among the medical community has left them unable to fully perform their jobs. The lawsuit was announced Tuesday at a press conference where the plaintiffs shared stories of navigating life-threatening pregnancy complications in the largest state in the nation to ban abortion. The state of Texas says they want to preserve life by banning safe, legal abortion, said Anna Zargarian, who had to travel to Colorado to get an abortion after her water broke at 19 weeks of pregnancy. Ive never felt my life matters less than it did during this situation. The plaintiffs are not asking the courts to overturn Texas abortion bans, but rather to clarify under what circumstances doctors can terminate pregnancies. Texass abortion bans can and should be read to ensure that physicians have wide discretion to determine the appropriate course of treatment, including abortion care, for their patients who present with emergent medical conditions without being second guessed by the Attorney General, the Texas Medical Board, a prosecutor, or a jury, the suit says. The lawsuit was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York legal group that has led many of the recent legal fights to protect abortion access. The lawsuit asks a judge to rule that abortion is permitted in cases in which a pregnant person has a physical condition or pregnancy complication that makes continuing pregnancy unsafe, has a condition that is exacerbated by or cannot be treated during pregnancy, or receives a diagnosis of a fetal condition that is incompatible with life. Texas intersecting abortion laws allow doctors to terminate pregnancies only to save the life of the pregnant patient, but the lawsuit argues that those statutes are vague and conflicting, leaving doctors unsure of how to safely proceed. There have been several bills filed to widen those exceptions to allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, or pregnancy anomalies that make the fetus incompatible with life, but they are not expected to advance in the Republican-dominated Legislature. Lauren Hall, one of the plaintiffs named in the suit, was thrilled when she learned she was pregnant. But at her 18-week anatomy scan, she learned that her fetus was developing without a skull, a lethal fetal anomaly known as anencephaly. Halls doctor said they couldnt help her, she told The Texas Tribune in September. She would have to remain pregnant until she miscarried or delivered a baby that could not survive outside the womb. Or, the doctor quietly suggested, Hall and her husband could leave the state. And she said, If you do that, dont tell anybody why youre traveling, dont tell your jobs, dont tell anyone at the airport, Hall told the Tribune. Which sounds extreme, but Roe had just been overturned. Everyone was so scared. This tragic, earth-shattering news, and the unimaginable choice she now faced, sparked a mental health crisis, Hall said. But she worried that telling a health care provider about her situation would invite more questions and, potentially, legal repercussions. Hall and her husband eventually cobbled together the money to buy last-minute flights to Seattle, where she was able to get an abortion. Hall said many people in her life had no idea how narrow the exceptions in the law were until she experienced it firsthand. They were just all shocked, like, Surely, theres an exception for this, Hall said. It just didnt occur to them that a ban would include cases like this. One of the other plaintiffs, Amanda Zurawski, learned at 17 weeks of pregnancy that she was miscarrying and at a high risk for infection. But the fetus still had a heartbeat and her life wasnt in danger, so she was sent home until she became septic. Zurawski, who attended the State of the Union in February as First Lady Jill Bidens guest, was left physically and emotionally scarred by the delay one of her fallopian tubes is permanently closed, and she said Tuesday that shes terrified as she resumes in vitro fertilization treatment. The barbaric restrictions our lawmakers have passed are having real-life implications on real people, she said during the press conference on the north lawn of the Texas state Capitol. The people in the building behind me have the power to fix this, yet theyve done nothing. In fact, theyre currently trying to pass even more restrictive measures. The Center for Reproductive Rights said Tuesday that it is continuing to look for other avenues to challenge state-level abortion bans in court, while advocating for federal abortion protections. The group unsuccessfully challenged Texas Senate Bill 8, which in 2021 banned abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, and argued on behalf of Jackson Womens Health Organization in the case that overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. This lawsuit, however, represents the first case brought by people who have had their pregnancy care directly impacted by new, post-Roe abortion laws, said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. These women represent only the tip of the iceberg, Northup said. This is the first lawsuit in the nation, but tragically it is unlikely to be the last.

The lawsuit, supported by two OB-GYNs, challenges the vagueness and conflicting nature of Texas’ abortion laws, particularly the exceptions for life-threatening conditions or fetal anomalies. The plaintiffs, who faced life-threatening pregnancy complications, argue that the laws create confusion for medical professionals and put patients’ lives at risk.

The Texas abortion ban allows abortion only to save the life of the mother, but the lawsuit seeks to broaden this exception. It asks for abortion to be permitted in cases where continuing the pregnancy is unsafe due to medical complications, or when a fetal condition is incompatible with life. The lawsuit does not seek to overturn the ban but to clarify when abortion can be legally performed.

One of the plaintiffs, Lauren Hall, was forced to travel to another state to terminate her pregnancy after discovering her fetus had a lethal condition, anencephaly. Another plaintiff, Amanda Zurawski, was sent home after being told her miscarriage was not life-threatening, despite the risk of infection, and later developed a serious infection. The plaintiffs and their supporters argue that the current restrictions harm real people and create unnecessary barriers to necessary medical care.

This case is significant as it is the first lawsuit brought by individuals directly impacted by post-Roe abortion laws in Texas. The Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit, continues to seek legal challenges against state abortion bans while advocating for federal abortion protections."

EJ MontiniArizona RepublicRepublican governor candidate Kari Lake is the in-your-face smack-talking candidate, right?The tough one.The former news reader will stare you down and wag her finger under your nose if she feels like youre challenging her.So, why is it that she seems kind of mealy-mouthed compared to Democrat Katie Hobbs when it comes to one of the most volatile issues facing politiciansAbortion.Katie Hobbs is unwavering about abortionHobbs is unwavering in her support of reproductive freedom.Check her campaign website, in which she says in partLet me be clear the decision to have a child should rest solely between a woman and her doctor, not the government or politicians .Thats why as governor, I will fearlessly work to increase access to abortion services and reproductive care, use my veto pen to oppose any restrictive and extreme measures coming from the legislature, and make sure that women and families have the resources they need to thrive right here in Arizona.On the offenseDems seek election wins to restore abortion rightsLake, on the other hand, has lately seemed to be vacillating, treading very close to the path of the namby-pamby.For example, after declaring victory in the GOP primary and having told Hobbs through the media, Im coming for you, Lake was evasive when asked by a reporter if shed be pushing for more strident abortion laws in Arizona.Does Kari Lake support abortion exceptions?When Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, Arizona was left with conflicting laws on the books.There is the pre-statehood ban that has no exceptions and would make doctors who perform abortions criminals. And there is the law passed by the Legislature this year banning abortions after 15 weeks except for medical emergencies and with no exceptions for rape or incest.Earlier in the campaign the candidates for governor were asked about the conflict and what their stands were.Hobbs was resolute in her support of abortion rights.Lake didnt comment on the conflict but, through her campaign sent a note to The Arizona Republic saying, Kari is pro-life but supports exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.Again, though, Arizona law allows for no exceptions.How does Lake feel about that?Who is coming for whom on this issue?When Lake was asked after declaring victory about her position she said, We have great laws on the books and were going to work with those.First, laws that conflict are not great.Second, Lake said she supported exceptions for rape and incest and Arizonas laws dont allow that, so how would she work with those?Or has she changed her position?Karrin Taylor Robson has finally turned against Trump Why the BidenMcCain friendship is a threat to MAGA Gov. Hobbs yanked her agency nominees. What's next? Want more opinions? Here's how to get them in your inboxOr is she hedging her bets and running a little scared, like Republicans across the country, since voters in Kansas overwhelmingly chose to protect abortion rights?Whats certain is that coming out of the gate, the finger-wagging, smack-talking Lake doesnt look so tough compared to Hobbs.Which begs the questionExactly who is coming for whom?Reach Montini at ed.montiniarizonarepublic.com.For more opinions content, please subscribe.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center azcentral Store Licensing Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions 2024 All rights reserved.","In this opinion piece, EJ Montini contrasts the positions of Arizona gubernatorial candidates Katie Hobbs and Kari Lake on abortion.

Hobbs, a Democrat, has a clear and unwavering stance on abortion. She emphasizes that the decision to have a child should be between a woman and her doctor, not the government. Hobbs vows to protect reproductive rights, advocating for increased access to abortion services and committing to use her veto power to block any restrictive measures from the legislature.

In contrast, Lake, a Republican, appears to be less definitive. Though she has voiced her pro-life stance, she supports exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. However, Arizona’s current laws contradict this position, as they allow no exceptions, leaving her stance unclear. When asked about Arizona’s conflicting laws—one banning abortion with no exceptions, and another restricting abortion after 15 weeks—Lake offered vague responses, stating she would work with existing laws without addressing how she would reconcile the inconsistencies. Montini suggests that Lake may be trying to play it safe, avoiding a firm stance to appeal to a broader electorate, especially after the overwhelming support for abortion rights in Kansas.

The piece concludes by questioning Lake’s toughness on abortion, implying that Hobbs’s clear and consistent position on the issue contrasts with Lake’s uncertainty."

COMMENTARY Life Jun 13, 2022 4 min read COMMENTARY BY Thomas Jipping TomJipping Senior Legal Fellow, Center for Legal and Judicial Studies Thomas Jipping is a Senior Legal Fellow for the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. President Ronald Reagan wrote that the real question today is not when human life begins, but, what is the value of human life? sankai Gety Images Key Takeaways The WHPA would gar far beyond Roe, attempting to prohibit any government anywhere from doing anything that might, potentially or indirectly, reduce abortions. Leading feminists once embraced, rather than repudiated, the truth about women and babies. Abortion kills babies, and its advocates are loudly telling us the value they place on human life. Copied In his 1983 essay Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation, President Ronald Reagan wrote that the real question today is not when human life begins, but, what is the value of human life? That will always be the real question, and it is the one question that abortion advocates will do anything to avoid answering. The so-called Womens Health Protection Act WHPA and a new set of abortion messaging dos and dont from the House of Representatives Pro Choice Caucus are their latest attempt to avoid the inconvenient truth that abortion kills babies. On May 11, for the second time in less than three months, the Senate voted against allowing consideration of the WHPA. Its sponsors want you to believe that the bill would simply codify Roe v. Wade in case, as appears likely, the Supreme Court overrules that decision, which created the right to abortion. In fact, the WHPA would gar far beyond Roe, attempting to prohibit any government anywhere from doing anything that might, potentially or indirectly, reduce the likelihood that abortions will actually take place. Not only that, the WHPA would require every state and local government to repeal any existing laws, regulations, rules, anything that also could have that effect. Members of Congress, who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, should know that Congress has no authority to dictate how state and local governments exercise powers that the Constitution gives them. Even in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court acknowledged that abortion affects two human beings, referring multiple times to unborn children, pregnant women, and even mother. In fact, the Court said that the presence of the unborn child made abortion inherently different than other rights. As radical as the WHPA is, as recently as 2017, it referred a dozen times to woman and multiple times to child. The bill stated its purpose as protecting a womans right and ability to determine whether and when to bear a child. EVENT Life After Roe Symposium That, however, was too close to reality for current abortion extremists. The WHPA introduced last year expands its focus from pregnant women to people with the capacity for pregnancy. These include cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, and those who identify with a different gender. The bill entertains these hypothetical categories while completely deleting any suggestion, hint, or whisper of the actual human beingthe unborn childwho actually exists. The bill even scrapped its prior definition of abortion because it referred to a live birth of what? and a dead fetus that must once have been alive. Leading feminists once embraced, rather than repudiated, the truth about women and babies. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, for example, published The Revolution magazine from 1868 to 1872, regularly arguing that the law should treat abortion for what it is, child murder. The first women to enter the medical profession separated killing babies from health care for women Dr. Charlotte Lozier, for example, campaigned both against abortion and for womens rights. Women, er, potentially pregnant people have come a long way, but not necessarily in the right direction. Then there are the abortion spinmeisters. Organizations promoting abortion have long produced various manuals, guides, and recommendations for abortion messaging. The latest instructions on this is a list of dos and donts from the House Pro-Choice Caucus with examples of harmful and helpful language. The confusion, however, starts right at the top. The Pro-Choice Caucuss first example of harmful language is the word choice. Wait, what? Hasnt choice been lynchpin of the abortion movements messaging for the last 50 years? Last September, in defending the WHPA, members of the Pro-Choice Caucus routinely described abortion as a deeply personal choice and pro-life legislators as anti-choice. According to the Pro-Choice Caucuss latest guidelines, however, Caucus members were actually using harmful language that, no doubt unbeknownst to them at the time, was undermining their own cause. The Pro-Choice Caucus now rejects another of the movements longstanding clarion calls. In 1992, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton said that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. The Democratic Platform that year endorsed reproductive choice theres that word again including the right to safe, legal abortion. Four years later, with Clinton running for re-election, the platform said Our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare. The Democratic platform made the same point in the next two cycles, with the 2004 document stating directly Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Hillary Clinton even used the same phrase during her 2008 presidential campaign. We Have a Duty To Protect the Unborn Not anymore. The 2008 and 2012 Democratic platforms dropped rare, while still endorsing efforts to reduce abortions. But since 2012, abortion advocates have embraced killing babies as fully legitimate all by itself. Signs at their rallies and protests often say Abortion On Demand and without Apology. The Pro-Choice Caucus also rejects any suggestion that abortion should be rare its website even include a photograph of caucus members on the Capitol steps holding signs that read Abortion Is Essential and Liberate Abortion. We cannot avoid answering the question Reagan asked almost four decades ago about the value of human life by pretending that human beings never existed before they were born or that men can somehow become pregnant, or by using some new words suggested by the latest focus group. Abortion kills babies, and its advocates are loudly telling us the value they place on human life. This piece originally appeared in Christian Renewal Magazine More on This Issue COMMENTARY 6 min read IVF and the Package Deal of Marriage, Sex, and Procreation COMMENTARY 3 min read Bidens SOTU Abortion Lies Tammy Duckworths IVF Push Meets a GOP Wall Subscribe to email updates Follow us Privacy Policy Copyright 2024, The Heritage Foundation","The article discusses the value of human life, focusing on the debate surrounding abortion, particularly in light of the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) and evolving abortion messaging. It emphasizes the question posed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983: “What is the value of human life?” rather than when life begins, arguing that abortion advocates avoid answering this question.

The article critiques the WHPA, which proponents claim would merely codify Roe v. Wade, but in reality, would go much further by preventing any government action that could reduce abortions, even indirectly. It would force states to repeal laws that might limit abortions. The piece stresses that Congress has no authority to mandate state actions in this area, referencing the constitutional limits on federal power.

The article also highlights the shift in abortion rhetoric. Initially, bills like the WHPA used language that acknowledged both women and unborn children, but the most recent versions have erased references to the unborn child, focusing on “people with the capacity for pregnancy” and removing any mention of live births. This marks a departure from earlier feminist leaders like Susan B. Anthony, who viewed abortion as “child murder.”

The piece also critiques changes in abortion advocacy language, pointing out that terms like “choice” and “rare” have been discarded by the Pro-Choice Caucus. Abortion is no longer framed as a difficult or rare choice but as an essential right. This shift indicates a broader change in how abortion is perceived, from a necessary but rare option to an unquestioned right.

Ultimately, the article argues that the real issue is the value placed on human life, with abortion advocates signaling through their rhetoric that human life, particularly that of the unborn, is not given the same value."

Columnist Sanchita Teeka provides five counter arguments when it comes to pro-life claims. By Sanchita Teeka, Columnist June 28, 2022As of Friday, a group of unelected officials made a decision ripping away a persons right to choose the right to an abortion. Albeit the fact that up to 61 of Americans support abortion in most cases, there is still around 39 of Americans who are opposed to the freedom of choice to have an abortion. Abortion is often misunderstood and this confusion can be reason why some call themselves pro-life. Pro-life people often think that they are genuinely holding the correct beliefs and that abortion is literally murder. Nonetheless, every pro-life argument has a stronger counterargument. 1. Abortion is plain murder. First, understand this is a stance that is incredibly hard to change in itself because pro-lifers believe it to be fact. Pro-lifers fully believe that abortion is murder, so no argument about control over uterus-holding people will work to change this belief. Get The Daily Illini in your inbox! Enter your email Select a newsletter Headline News Catch the latest on University of Illinois news, sports, and more. Delivered every weekday. Stay up to date on all things Illini sports. Delivered every Monday. Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! What can be used is the argument of bodily autonomy, especially the analogy of organ donation. Most people understand that a person has the right to decide whether or not they want their organs to be donated, and this isnt a controversial opinion. Even if someones organs could have been used to save another persons life, we dont consider that to be murder if the person has chosen not to donate organs. In a similar sense, it doesnt make sense to force a person with a uterus to give their organs and body to a fetus. 2. Life is life. While many pro-lifers believe this, their actions dont show it. For one, if they eat meat or kill bugs, theyre literally ending life on a daily basis. These actions show that they understand the complexity of life and that it is not all the same. A common counterargument is the idea of potential. Pro-lifers might say that human fetuses are intelligent and have potential but animals dont, which unlocks a new set of inconsistencies in their reasoning. For one, studies have shown that pigs and other animals have intelligence levels comparable to young children, so in that case they shouldnt be eating animals if life is life. Additionally, theyre likely not advocating against the death penalty, guns or actively trying to prevent suicide. However, mentioning this would probably elicit a defensive response because nobody likes being called out on their blatant hypocrisy. 3. What if the baby grew up to cure cancer, or was the next president? While this is definitely possible, the same can be said of the person forced to carry to term. What if the 12 year old forced to have a baby would have grown up to do those things herself but couldnt because they were carrying a baby? Or what if the middle-aged person was in the midst of doing these things but was halted by having a baby? Alternatively, what if that baby grew up to be the exact opposite and committed horrible crimes? These what ifs can be applied to literally anything because this line of argument rides on a logical fallacy. 4. There are so many people who want a child. Yes, but there are already hundreds of thousands of kids in foster care. If this statement was true, this number would be zero. The people who do want to adopt overwhelmingly want an infant. They also want one that is white, seen by the fact that most adoptions are of white kids while children of color make up the most in foster care. The foster care system is entirely unsatisfactory and the last thing needed now is more children in the system. 5. What if your parents aborted you? I wouldnt be alive so I wouldnt care and I wouldnt be having another what if argument based on a logical fallacy. Even after using all of these arguments and more, a pro-lifer may still not be convinced and might maintain their beliefs. Yet, having the argument or conversation means that all sides of the argument have been made clear. Only with arguments and conversation are we able to see the entire picture, and maybe in the process have one review their beliefs.

Here’s a summary of the points:
	1.	Abortion is murder: Pro-lifers often assert that abortion is the same as murder. Teeka counters this with the principle of bodily autonomy, using the analogy of organ donation. Just as people have the right to refuse to donate organs, a person with a uterus should have the right to choose whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.
	2.	Life is life: Pro-lifers argue that all life is sacred, but Teeka highlights the inconsistency in this view, pointing out that pro-lifers may eat meat or support actions like the death penalty, which contradict the absolute sanctity of life. She also mentions that animals like pigs are shown to have intelligence similar to young children, which challenges the notion that only humans have value.
	3.	What if the baby grew up to be extraordinary?: Pro-lifers often suggest that an unborn child could grow up to make significant contributions to society. Teeka counters by applying this logic to the person who would be forced to carry the pregnancy, suggesting that they, too, could have contributed something valuable to society had they not been restricted by pregnancy.
	4.	There are many people who want to adopt: While pro-lifers argue that adoption is an alternative to abortion, Teeka points out the large number of children already in the foster care system, many of whom are older or of color. The reality of the adoption system, where infants and white children are more desirable, makes this argument less persuasive.
	5.	What if your parents aborted you?: This hypothetical is commonly used by pro-lifers, but Teeka dismisses it, arguing that if she were never born, she wouldn’t care about such “what-ifs” because it’s a logical fallacy.

Teeka concludes that while these counterarguments may not immediately change the minds of pro-life individuals, they serve to illuminate the complexities of the debate and encourage conversation that could help people reconsider their beliefs."

Unfortunately, the content appears to be behind a paywall, so I can’t access the article directly. However, I can offer a summary of the general situation regarding abortion laws in Poland based on available information:

Poland has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. In 2020, the country’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortions due to fetal defects were unconstitutional, leaving abortion legal only in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life or health is at risk. This decision led to widespread protests and criticism both within Poland and internationally, as it significantly limited access to abortion services.

The law is particularly controversial because it disproportionately affects women in need of abortions due to fetal abnormalities, often leading to emotional and physical distress. Women’s rights groups have expressed concerns about the erosion of reproductive rights and the potential risks to women’s health. The debate continues to be a major point of contention in Poland’s political landscape.

Would you like more detailed information on any aspect of this issue?"

PHOTO courtesy Womens Action Group by Edinah Masiyiwa February 14, 2020 Chipo Moyo not her real name was ready to give birth. Over the past eight months she had followed all the advice of her midwife and was booked to deliver in a Harare clinic. But when she arrived, already in labor, the clinic doors were locked. Passersby explained that the nurses were on strike. As her contractions came more quickly, Chipo and her husband took public transport to a hospital where she finally delivered. Similar chaos confronted women across the city. Naked women lay on the bare floor in one makeshift delivery room. Women moved from one health care center to another looking for someplace to deliver. Some women went to private hospitals where they had to pay very high prices for delivery. Although governments may sign lofty declarations, they too often fail to put in place the practical strategies needed to follow through. As that crisis grew late last year, I was attending a global summit called ICPD25 in Nairobi. The summits goal was to galvanize support for universal access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health information, education and servicesand to complete the unfinished business of the first International Conference on Population and Development ICPD, held 25 years earlier. I was there on behalf of the Womens Action Group, an organization fighting for the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women in Zimbabwe. But as I listened to government leaders solemnly pledge their support to the ICPD Program of Action, text messages from home alerted me to the situation on the ground and highlighted one simple fact words alone dont save lives. Although governments may sign lofty declarations, they too often fail to put in place the practical strategies needed to follow through. This is unacceptable.

REUTERSSiphiwe Sibeko To be sure, there has been significant progress in the past 25 years, and the summit catalogued the gains. For example, global maternal mortality rates have fallen by 38 percent and the number of skilled birth attendants increased by 80 percent. But, as also noted by experts attending the summit, this progress has been tragically uneven. Consider the goal of zero preventable maternal deaths. According to a UNICEF report, from 20002017, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia accounted for 86 per cent of maternal deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africans suffer from the highest maternal mortality ratio, 533 maternal deaths per 100,000 live birthsor 200,000 maternal deaths a yearmore than double the global average. 120 times Greater risk of a woman in a low-income country dying from a maternal-related cause than women in high-income countries More needs to be done in Africa. The maternal mortality ratio is unacceptable, especially considering that almost all maternal deaths are preventable by having skilled, supervised health personneldoctors, nurses, or midwivesattend births and by having the proper equipment and supplies available. The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel varies greatly by global region. From 20122017, only 59 per cent of the births in sub-Saharan Africa were attended by skilled health personnel. In other world regions, coverage ranged from 6899 percent. In Zimbabwe, the governments persistent failure to prioritize the training, pay and retention of skilled health personnel is largely to blame for the nurses two-month strike that left pregnant women to deliver at the hands of untrained traditional birth attendants. Maternal mortality rates are also sensitive indicators of wealth inequality. The risk of a woman in a low-income country dying from a maternal-related cause is about 120 times greater than a woman living in a high-income country. And, most of the worlds lowest-income countries are in Africa, including Niger, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Sierra Leone. A mother and child arrive for treatment at a local government hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe on February 4, 2020. REUTERSPhilimon Bulawayo The majority of the worlds countries, including my country Zimbabwe, left the ICPD25 having committed to mobilize the required financing to finish the ICPD Program of Action. They committed to national budget allocations gender budgeting and auditing and exploring new, participatory and innovative financing instruments to ensure full, effective and accelerated implementation of the ICPD program. Looking ahead to March 2020, governments will again gather, this time for the Commission on the Status of Women in New York. There, they will review the Beijing Platform for Action that was put in place 25 years ago to promote gender equity in health and 12 other crucial areas. African countries must look closely at what it will take to save the lives of women and girls. While such conferences can affirm global intention toward achieving gender equality, governments must realize that making a commitment and not following through is worse than not making a commitment at allfor such inaction fuels cynicism, distrust, and despair. African countries must look closely at what it will take to save the lives of women and girls. Rather than set priorities at the expense of womens health, they must recognize that womens health is central to a vibrant society and growing economy. But if history is any indication, governments wont do it on their own. Civil society organizations must hold their governments accountable. Africa needs trained personnel to attend to pregnant women. Its that simple. Governments should start by allocating 15 percent of their national budgets to healthas they have also committed to do.

Despite global commitments made at the ICPD25 summit, progress has been uneven, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where maternal mortality rates remain alarmingly high. A significant issue is the lack of skilled health personnel, exacerbated by underfunding and poor retention strategies, as seen in Zimbabwe’s nurse strikes. While maternal mortality has declined globally, sub-Saharan Africa still accounts for 86% of global maternal deaths.

The article stresses that these deaths are preventable with proper medical staff, equipment, and resources. For instance, in Zimbabwe, many women are forced to give birth with untrained traditional birth attendants due to a lack of skilled healthcare workers. The gap in maternal health outcomes between low-income and high-income countries is vast, with women in low-income countries facing much higher risks.

The author calls on African governments to fulfill their commitments by allocating at least 15% of national budgets to health, as promised in international declarations. Civil society organizations also have a crucial role in holding governments accountable for implementing these promises. The article concludes that prioritizing women’s health is vital for a prosperous society and economy, and governments must move beyond empty promises to concrete actions."

The Tribunal’s decision, initially announced in October 2020, had sparked widespread public backlash, leading the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government to delay its enactment. Under this ruling, abortion is prohibited in nearly all cases, with exceptions only for rape, incest, or serious threats to the mother’s health.

During one protest outside the Constitutional Tribunal building, tensions escalated as police employed “kettling” tactics to control the crowd, confining demonstrators in a limited space for hours. This resulted in physical clashes, and at least three people were detained, including Klementyna Suchanow, a prominent leader in the Women’s Strike movement, which has been a key organizer of the protests. The ruling has intensified debates over reproductive rights in Poland, as doctors now face imprisonment for performing illegal abortions, highlighting deep divides within the country over the government’s conservative policies on women’s rights."

More VISION TVS RADIO BUKEDDE AMAWULIRE KAMPALA SUN UNFPA to inject over sh355 billion in reproductive health services Nov 02, 2020 He says the biggest amount of the money will go to sexual and reproductive health services and rights and making sure that women are not dying because they want to give birth. The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA is to inject 95 million over sh355 billion to promote sexual, reproductive health services and rights in Uganda starting next year, over the next five years. The UNFPA Uganda Country Representative Alain Sibenaler disclosed the financial commitment on Tuesday in Kampala at a high-level political endorsement seminar for the 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025. ""We have a very ambitious resource package that we have attached to this country programme document it amounts to 95 million over five years, and that's divided into two categories, the regular resources that is the envelope that we are given every year from our own headquarters over the next five years and then we have to mobilise resources and that's what we call other resources."" ""We have put a figure of 75.7 million which is a slight increase from the previous one within three years of this current country program we have mobilised close to 80 million already,"" says Sibenaler. He says the biggest amount of the money will go to sexual and reproductive health services and rights and making sure that women are not dying because they want to give birth. From the same funds 17 million is to fight against Gender Based Violence GBV and 9 million for the National Population Council and National Planning Authority. Sibenaler warned the population dynamics as they are right now, will have repercussions on the ability of Uganda to achieve national economic growth targets that are needed for Uganda to achieve the status of a middle income country. According to World Bank statistics, the fertility rate in Uganda averages 5.6 children per woman. It means on average every Ugandan woman can have five children. It's more than double the global average of 2.4 children and there is concern Uganda's population is likely to hit 55 million by 2025. ""We want to have universal access to quality integrated sexual and reproductive health services and rights for women and young people in Uganda."" UNFPA Uganda Country Representative Alain Sibenaler addressing a high-level political endorsement seminar for the 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025. ""We are targeting key beneficiaries including young people, women, adolescents, refugees, ethnic minorities and hard to reach communities, plus migrants,"" says Sibenaler. He says through the targeted group UNFPA and the government wants to have reduced teenage pregnancy and child marriages, reduced unmet need for family planning, and reduced maternal deaths. ""These are the key ingredients to reduced fertility. We are not saying you should have a certain number of children but we know that if children are not being married before they are 18, when the girls stay in school, it automatically reduces the high fertility of families,"" he says. Sibenaler said together with the government UNFPA is aiming at all vulnerable and marginalised groups having equitable access to the utilisation of quality basic social and protection services. ""We are building three systems health, education, and protection system."" ""It means we want access to services, utilization and information of the services to make informed choices which include sexuality education by Ministry of Education and Sports, and capacity to reduce and respond to GBV and harmful practices."" ""These are basic human rights for women and girls to thrive throughout life and we are delivering that right in an integrated package wherever we are present in the country,"" says Sibenaler. The UN Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango says the new 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025 is fully aligned to the UN profession framework and it's sufficient to support the implementation of the National Development Plan III, Vision 2040, and the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. ""By 2025 vulnerable and marginalised people will have improved equitable access, to quality social services and protection,"" she says. The previous status The Director General of Uganda's National Population Council NPC says previously there was high mortality and fertility. ""We had too many people dying and also very many births, right now death is declining, infant mortality has come down tremendously, and the country even achieved the Millennium Development Goal MDG target replaced now by SDGs."" ""Even fertility is starting to come down. This creates an opportunity where we can change our population age structure that had many young children who are dependants and create a lot of pressure on government social services, to a less dependent bigger working population. ""If they are healthy, educated, with jobs they can be the engine of growth,"" says Dr. Musinguzi. UN Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango says the new 9th government of Uganda and UNFPA Country Programme 2021 -2025 is fully aligned to the UN profession framework. Managing the Impact of COVID-19 The Minister of State for Finance and Economic Development David Bahati says the impact of the coronavirus pandemic COVID 19 pauses a threat to gains made in providing sexual and reproductive health services and rights for women and girls, He says the impact of COVID-19 could negatively affect the country's progress towards consolidating economic growth brought by change in the age structure of the country resulting from a rapid decline in fertility and mortality rates that is shifting the population structure from one dominated by dependent children to that dominated by economically productive working adults. ""The increasing number of girls that may not join school again due to pregnancy related challenges brought about by COVID 19 and increasing GBV, loss of income due to the closure of businesses, limited access to sexual and reproductive health services are among the urgent issues that directly impact young people that we have to address."" ""It is, therefore, good to note that the new Country Programme has taken into consideration the possible impact of COVID-19 and will prioritise mitigation measures as part of continued support to the national COVID-19 Response Plan,"" says Bahati. Government commitment The first commitment was the recent passing by the cabinet of the National population policy, says Dr Musinguzi The Minister of State for Foreign affairs Okello Oryem says the government is committed to continuing allocating annually at least 10 of the countries maternal and child health resource to adolescent friendly and reproductive health services, and elimination of obstacles that stand in the way of girl's empowerment including teenage pregnancies, child marriages as well as all forms of GBV. In addition, the government has committed to the promotion of universal access to all methods of family planning and to reduce unmet need for family planning from 28 to 10 per cent by 2022. ""Uganda has a challenge of very vulnerable communities and needs to address challenges regarding their reproductive health. We are committed to delivering these programmes,"" says Oryem. He also pledged government commitment to operationalising the National Sexuality Education Policy Framework that the Ministry of Education and Sports launched in 2018 to provide a formal national direction for sexuality education within Ugandan schools while upholding the positive cultural and religious value of the country. Oryem says Uganda is committed to placing individual dignity and human rights at the very heart of human development. He pledged government commitment to prioritize human capital development, a key component of National Development Plan III, which focuses on sustainable industrialisation for inclusive growth employment and wealth creation in order to leave no one behind. Oryem commended UNFPA for supporting Uganda in delivering SDG goals numbers 3, 4, 5, and 10. All these are important goals that not only support the advancement of the Programme of Action POA of the International Conference on Population and Development ICPD reached in Cairo, Egypt in 1994 but also impacts on the achievement of other SDGs. Oryem says in Nairobi Kenya last year, President Yoweri Museveni committed to further advance the ICPD agenda The Minister of State for Finance says as an indication of its commitment to the partnership with UNFPA government continues to make an annual voluntary contribution of 5,000 to UNFPA's core resources.

This funding, part of the 9th Country Programme with the Ugandan government, will focus primarily on sexual and reproductive health, with the goal of reducing maternal mortality, promoting family planning, and addressing gender-based violence (GBV).

UNFPA’s Uganda Country Representative, Alain Sibenaler, outlined that the funds include USD 75.7 million sourced through external fundraising. These resources will primarily target vulnerable groups, including young people, women, ethnic minorities, and communities in hard-to-reach areas. Key initiatives include reducing teenage pregnancy, child marriage, maternal deaths, and unmet needs for family planning. Sibenaler emphasized that reducing the high fertility rate in Uganda—currently 5.6 children per woman—is essential for economic growth, as it can lead to a shift from a dependency-heavy population to one that is more economically productive.

The programme aims to build three main systems—health, education, and protection—by improving access to integrated health services, educating the youth about reproductive health, and reducing harmful practices like child marriage and GBV. The program is in alignment with Uganda’s National Development Plan III, Vision 2040, and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those addressing health, gender equality, and social justice.

Additional support from the Ugandan government includes commitments to funding maternal and child health, improving access to family planning, and operationalizing the National Sexuality Education Policy Framework. Uganda’s Minister of State for Finance, David Bahati, acknowledged the threat COVID-19 poses to these initiatives, citing rising pregnancy-related school dropouts, increased GBV, and reduced access to reproductive health services. However, the new Country Programme includes measures to mitigate COVID-19’s impact on these goals.

The UNFPA programme also supports Uganda’s commitment to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action, an agenda reaffirmed by Uganda’s President Museveni in 2019. The government pledges to uphold human rights and prioritize human capital development, aiming for inclusive growth that does not leave vulnerable communities behind."

Burbidge aspires to make abortion unthinkable in his new role as chairman of the U.S. bishops Committee for Pro-Life Activities. Bishop Burbidge was elected to the post Nov. 16 by his fellow prelates at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops 2022 Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore. The previous chairman, Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, was elected vice president of the bishops conference the day before. Bishop Burbidge will serve the remainder of Archbishop Loris term, through November 2024. Reflecting on the vote on his Walk Humbly Podcast Nov. 18, he praised the efforts of his predecessor. He called the reversal of Roe v. Wade probably the most significant pro-life victory in the last century in giving states the opportunity to protect the unborn. Its a significant time in the life of our country. We know that, he said. Politically, legislatively and pastorally, we must do all we can to end the evil of abortion, which ends the life of a precious child and deeply wounds the childs mother. Many Catholics are uninformed about extreme state laws that allow abortion during all nine months of pregnancy until birth, he said. We need people to be aware of this sad reality and to insist on the humane protections of the pre-born. Such advocacy efforts depend in part, Bishop Burbidge suggested, on communicating how the church supports women before, during and after crisis pregnancies provides adoption services and works to bring healing to women and men involved in abortion. We want you to know that theres every reason to choose life because we will be there to provide you with the counseling you may need or the financial resources or the basic necessities, he said. We want to walk with moms in pregnancy and in crisis pregnancy and to assure them that they will never be alone. In his new capacity, Bishop Burbidge will celebrate Mass and serve as principal homilist at the National Prayer Vigil for Life Jan. 19 at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. The next day, he will participate in the 50th annual March for Life. He encouraged Catholics to attend both events. We have to transform hearts, he said. And I think a peaceful witness, a peaceful march and prayer are ways to do that. In the diocesan Office of Marriage, Family and Respect Life, a cheer erupted when the election was announced because we have seen up close his deep and heartfelt commitment to protecting human life at every stage, said Thrse Bermpohl, executive director. We have benefited from his stalwart leadership in our diocese and know that all dioceses now will as well. Bishop Burbidge teaches and leads his people as much through his action as through his uplifting statements and homilies, she said. Bermpohl noted that Bishop Burbidge regularly celebrates Masses for the dignity of life and prays in front of abortion facilities. She added that hes a supporter of both the Gabriel Project ministry that offers prenatal assistance to pregnant women and Project Rachels work to heal all those harmed by abortion. There are so many ways Bishop Burbidges leadership in the diocese advances a culture of life, said Virginia Catholic Conference Executive Director Jeff Caruso, citing the prelates calls for Catholics to advocate for pro-life positions through the VCC website and email alerts. His emphasis on communicating with elected officials to protect life is very effective and so important. His outreach and invitation to all of us helps us heed Christs call to be faithful citizens who defend life to the fullest. Bishop Burbidge also serves as episcopal moderator for the National Catholic Partnership on Disability, which helps equip dioceses and parishes with the resources to serve and fully engage people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. At the USCCB meeting, he invited his peers to collaborate with NCPD to more effectively respond to the pastoral and spiritual needs of those with disabilities a step that further underscores the churchs commitment to all human life. Pro-life is making sure that every single human person is treated with the dignity and respect that belongs to them as a child of God, he said. Schweers can be reached at email protected.

Burbidge of the Diocese of Arlington has outlined key goals to advance a pro-life mission. He emphasizes peaceful advocacy, educating the faithful on life issues, and demonstrating the Catholic Church’s unwavering support for life at all stages. His approach includes providing support for women during crisis pregnancies, offering adoption services, and promoting healing for those impacted by abortion, underscoring that “we will be there” to support mothers through counseling, resources, and community support.

Bishop Burbidge sees the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade as a pivotal pro-life victory, creating an opportunity for states to enact protections for the unborn. He has voiced concerns over extreme state laws permitting late-term abortions and seeks to raise awareness and push for humane legal protections for unborn children. As part of his advocacy, he will celebrate Mass at the National Prayer Vigil for Life in January and participate in the annual March for Life, encouraging Catholics to attend these events as a peaceful show of support for life and a means to transform hearts.

His commitment to life extends through his diocesan work, where he leads by example, celebrating Masses for the dignity of life and supporting projects like the Gabriel Project, which aids pregnant women, and Project Rachel, which offers healing to those affected by abortion. Bishop Burbidge’s advocacy also extends to protecting the dignity of people with disabilities through his role with the National Catholic Partnership on Disability, reinforcing his belief that pro-life efforts encompass respect and dignity for all. His leadership is seen as a guide for Catholics in the Diocese of Arlington and beyond to engage actively in pro-life advocacy and defend the sanctity of life."

Taking into account the huge number of participants, it was a very peaceful protest, he added.Demonstrations of this scale were last seen in the solidarity movement of the 1980s in Poland which led to the collapse of the government, analysts say.The protest in Warsaw was the culmination of nine days of nationwide protests since a court ruling on October 22 deemed abortion due to fetal defects to be unconstitutional. This meant abortion in Poland would only be legal in two scenarios if the pregnancy threatened the mothers life and health, or if a woman became pregnant following rape or incest.Demonstrators also turned out in Gdansk, Biaystok, Poznan, Krakw, Wroclaw, Torun, Sczescin, Mynlenice, Gorlice and Jaso on Friday.According to local media, 430,000 people attended more than 400 demonstrations across the country against the ban on Wednesday. Online supporters are using the tag ThisIsWar to show solidarity with those marching.The protests have been taking place in defiance of a ban on gatherings of more than five people due to the coronavirus pandemic.Aerial footage of the demonstration in Warsaw posted to social media showed the vast scale of the turnout there on Friday evening.Protest organisers urged protesters to make their way towards the residence of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice Party Leader PiS who is widely seen as the de facto decision maker in Poland.The demonstration ended there at around 11 p.m. local time and organizers urged protesters to make their way home safely.

Proudly powered by Newspack by Automattic","In Warsaw, Poland, massive protests erupted on Friday in response to a court ruling that nearly banned all forms of abortion. This gathering, one of the largest in Poland since the 1980s, drew over 100,000 participants according to Warsaw’s mayor, with organizers claiming around 150,000 people. Police reported the detention of 37 individuals, mostly football hooligans, but described the overall protest as largely peaceful given the turnout.

The court ruling on October 22 deemed abortions due to fetal defects unconstitutional, effectively limiting legal abortions to cases where the mother’s life is at risk or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. This decision sparked a wave of protests across Poland, with gatherings in major cities like Gdansk, Krakow, and Wroclaw, involving an estimated 430,000 people across 400 demonstrations earlier in the week. Demonstrators, using the hashtag #ThisIsWar, defied COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings to voice their opposition to the new law.

Protestors directed their anger at Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) and seen as a key influence behind the abortion restrictions. The protest in Warsaw culminated outside his residence, concluding around 11 p.m. with organizers encouraging participants to return home safely."

In Poland, Behemoth frontman Nergal is making sure a piece of legislation in Poland doesn't go unnoticed, calling attention to his country's government attempting to push an abortion ban through amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.The ""Stop Abortion"" bill is scheduled to be read on April 15 and 16 and if passed it would restrict the reproductive rights of women in Poland. This comes as the country is currently under self-isolating practices that ban large gatherings, thus keeping assembly of protests from happening and hurting the chances that the bill might be denied.""Polish government is using isolation restrictions to enact the complete abortion ban in my home country. Im speechless and terrified to see how shameless they are on the way to utter victory. to turn Poland into next North Korea or Belarus. Utterly disgusting. I honestly hate the fact I breathe the same air,"" bemoans the musician.The singer has not been one to keep quiet, especially when it comes to the Polish government. In 2010, he famously faced blasphemy charges in Poland for ripping up a bible onstage during a performance and calling it ""a book of lies."" The charges against him were later dropped.In 2017, he butted heads with Polish authorities again, this time being summoned by Polish prosecutors over the sale of a piece of merchandise that resembled Poland's official coat of arms.

All rights reserved.","During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Nergal, frontman of the Polish metal band Behemoth, spoke out against a proposed Polish government bill aiming to further restrict abortion rights. This “Stop Abortion” bill was set for discussion on April 15 and 16, during a time when public gatherings were banned, preventing large-scale protests. Nergal criticized the government’s timing, accusing officials of using the isolation period to advance restrictive legislation without public opposition. He condemned these actions as a dangerous move toward authoritarianism, comparing Poland’s trajectory to countries like North Korea and Belarus.

Nergal, known for his outspoken criticism of the Polish government, has previously faced legal issues due to his controversial actions, including being charged with blasphemy in 2010 after tearing up a Bible during a performance. He also battled Polish authorities over merchandise that allegedly disrespected Poland’s national symbols. Despite these conflicts, Nergal has continued to push back against government policies he views as oppressive."

Credit Yehyun Kim ctmirror.org Republican Bob Stefanowskis carefully worded position on abortion won plaudits Thursday from an anti-abortion leader who sees common ground with a Connecticut gubernatorial nominee for the first time in decades. Peter Wolfgang, the president of the Family Institute of Connecticut, was responding to a statement from Stefanowski indicating support for adding a parental notification provision to a Connecticut abortion rights law that he otherwise would not attempt to change. It has heartened pro-life voters. We know that Bob is not 100 with us. Weve always suspected it. And now we know it for sure, Wolfgang said. But what we also know is where he does have common ground with us. Stefanowski, who was nominated by Republicans over the weekend for a rematch with Gov. Ned Lamont, has positioned himself to the right of the Democratic governor on abortion while not opposing Connecticuts 32-year-old law codifying the tenets of Roe v. Wade. His approach will test whether a candidate can appeal to social conservatives, who Wolfgang has long complained have been marginalized by the Connecticut Republican establishment, without losing more voters who support abortion rights. When abortion comes up in Connecticut, Democrats snap to attention, and Republicans wet themselves. And Bob is the first Republican in 20 years that Ive seen to actually seize the initiative and flip the script with that statement, Wolfgang said. Want more in-depth Connecticut reporting? Get CT Mirror's latest government and public policy reporting in your inbox daily. In a written statement issued Wednesday, Stefanowski said, under no circumstances will I as Governor attempt to change the existing law. A womans right to choose has been, is, and will remain codified in Connecticut State Law, including Connecticuts ban on late-term abortions except in the case where the mothers health is at risk. Stefanowski, consistent with his position in 2018, also broke with Lamont on the issue of requiring parental notification for a minor to obtain an abortion an addition Wolfgang sees as a gesture to social conservatives. Consistent with the majority of other states, Connecticut should consider a parental notification requirement for minors under 16 seeking an abortion, except in the case of rape or incest, Stefanowski said. Democrats seized on the ambiguity in Stefanowskis statement He promised not to personally seek changes restricting an adult womans access to abortion without saying if he would oppose or veto them. More STORIES in Politics Secretary of the State files Bridgeport election complaint with SEEC CT bill seeks transparency on junk fees added to tickets, hotels Wolfgang acknowledged the wiggle room in Stefanowskis statement about parental notification The candidate said the state should consider such a measure, not that he would propose or support one. Would you love to see him say that he supports parental notification in a more active voice? I would definitely love to see it, Wolfgang said. But I, again, Im reading that statement against the backdrop of what the Republicans have been saying in the week or two since the Dobbs leak. The leak of a draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization suggests a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court is prepared to overturn Roe, the 49-year-old landmark case that struck down state bans on abortions before fetal viability. When Republicans dont answer the abortion issue, as I think theyve been doing since the Dobbs leak, its a lose-lose, Wolfgang said. Youre telling pro-lifers that youre not with us and youre telling pro-choicers that you have something to hide. It just never works. Wolfgang, a featured speaker at an abortion protest that drew 2,000 to the state Capitol in March, acknowledged that the bar may be relatively low for getting a good grade from the anti-abortion movement in Connecticut, a heavily Catholic state that nonetheless has been consistently supportive of abortion rights. It is one of a few states that has affirmatively declared a womans right to an abortion. A 1990 law provides that the decision to terminate a pregnancy prior to the viability of the fetus shall be solely that of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician. Peter Wolfgang, center, at the March for Life protest in March. Credit CTMIRROR.ORG If youre pro-life in the state of Connecticut, you are very much grading on a curve, said Wolfgang, who branded Stefanowskis position that of a pro-choice moderate. Stefanowski has been careful in his statements about abortion, an issue unmentioned in his acceptance speech last week. He has yet to submit to public questioning about abortion, instead communicating with the press and voters by written statements that initially downplayed the issue as a matter of settled law in Connecticut. His campaign offered no reaction to Wolfgangs assessment. I think Bobs statement speaks for itself, said Liz Kurantowicz, the senior adviser to the Stefanowski campaign. Stefanowski has refused to take a position on a new law declaring Connecticut a safe harbor against lawsuits against out-of-state women seeking abortions here or the abortion providers. A scathing report released this week found an alarming lack of oversight of CTs . Do you know the answer? Play this week's news quiz to find out. His running mate, Rep. Laura Devlin of Fairfield, voted for it, and his opponent, Lamont, signed it into law. Wolfgang said he had no idea why Stefanowski has refused to take a position. Ill take his silence over Devlins affirmative vote for it, Wolfgang said. Wolfgang said Devlins vote, which she says was cast without consulting Stefanowski, brought no abortion-rights voters to the fold, while turning off some opponents. I think Rep. Devlin put Bob in a very difficult position by voting in favor of that bill. I know that Rep. Devlin is pro choice, he said. I know that she understands the difference between pro-choice and pro-life. Im not sure if she understands the difference between pro-choice moderate and being more extreme on abortion. Because that was an extreme vote. Devlin could not be reached for comment Thursday. No parental notification bill in her tenure has cleared even the low hurdle of a committee vote scheduling a public hearing. Connecticut law requires a minor seeking an abortion to be counseled about the alternatives to abortion, including adoption, and the possibility of consulting her parents. About three dozen other states require either consent or notification, with some ability to bypass the requirement in the case of abusive parents. In 2018 and in comments this week, Lamont indicated a comfort with Connecticuts approach. At a visit to a tulip farm in Preston on Thursday, a WTNH reporter asked how he would feel about a 13-year-old getting an abortion without parental consent. I dont think you can regulate and have laws for each and every eventuality, Lamont said, according to audio provided by the governors office. My instinct is that 98 of people, younger people, talk to their parents. If they feel comfortable, they feel like its safe, its the right thing to do. Abortions by females younger than 15 are rare. Of the more than 9,000 abortions in Connecticut in 2019, 20 were performed on girls 14 or younger and 788 on patients 15 to 19, according to the most recent statistics available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationally, the percentage of abortions involving females from 15-19 fell steadily from 14.6 in 2010 to 8.7 in 2019, a 40 drop over a decade. Before you leave.

All Rights Reserved. Powered by Newspack","Bob Stefanowski, a Connecticut Republican gubernatorial nominee, has garnered tentative support from anti-abortion groups due to his stance on abortion, despite maintaining some distance from fully pro-life views. Peter Wolfgang, president of the Family Institute of Connecticut, expressed cautious optimism after Stefanowski’s statement supporting a parental notification requirement for minors seeking abortions, even though Stefanowski pledged not to alter the state’s existing abortion law, which enshrines Roe v. Wade principles. Wolfgang acknowledged that while Stefanowski is not fully aligned with anti-abortion advocates, his openness to parental notification marks a rare point of agreement in Connecticut’s pro-choice landscape.

Stefanowski’s nuanced stance aims to attract socially conservative voters while trying not to alienate pro-choice constituents. He explicitly stated he would not attempt to restrict abortion rights for adults, a position the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Ned Lamont, countered by highlighting the possible ambiguities in Stefanowski’s promise. The debate over parental notification, which Connecticut does not mandate, has intensified following a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion suggesting Roe v. Wade might be overturned.

Stefanowski’s position on Connecticut’s new law protecting out-of-state women seeking abortions remains undefined. His running mate, Rep. Laura Devlin, voted in favor of this law, drawing criticism from Wolfgang, who argued that Devlin’s vote did not attract pro-choice voters but may have dissuaded some conservative ones. Gov. Lamont, meanwhile, defended the state’s policy on minors, indicating that most young people involve their parents when seeking an abortion.

The complex political dynamics reflect Connecticut’s unique stance on abortion rights in a state that historically supports pro-choice laws. With the upcoming election, Stefanowski’s balancing act between social conservatism and Connecticut’s strong pro-choice stance presents both a challenge and a potential strategic pivot in Connecticut politics."

The women, peace and security agenda is anchored in human rights and this resolution could have turned back the clock on 20 years of progress.Women in conflict-affected countries are suffering catastrophic impacts due to Covid-19. Any attack on this critical tool for advancing womens health and rights is dangerous and were glad to see a diverse group of nations stand up for the agenda and its bold commitments to gender equality.This year marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the security councils resolution 1325, the first to recognise womens unique and disproportionate experience of conflict and demand their equal role in peace negotiations, operations and reconstruction. Since then nine more resolutions have been adopted.But there are huge gaps in implementation. The recent rollback on womens rights globally has made further progress difficult.Last year a resolution introduced by Germany to combat wartime rape was only passed when references in the text to sexual and reproductive health and rights were removed to suit the US.In a special session of the security council on Thursday, both the UK and Germany indicated they would not vote for Russias resolution, introduced while it held the presidency.Both countries said they would not allow a retreat on womens rights.China, South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia joined Russia to vote for the resolution.Explore more on these topicsPeace and reconciliationWomen's rights and gender equalityRussiaUnited NationsEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUNRWA suspends aid to northern Gaza amid collapse of civil order24 Feb 2024Brazil puts reform of UN at heart of its G20 presidency22 Feb 2024UN chief urges donors to reconsider UNRWA funding withdrawal28 Jan 2024UN secretary general says Israels rejection of two-state solution is unacceptable23 Jan 2024World faces heightened risk of mass atrocities due to global inaction8 Dec 2023Washington faces UN showdown over fresh resolution for Gaza ceasefire7 Dec 2023UN chief shocked by misrepresentation of comments in row with Israel26 Oct 2023UN report 80 of Gaza inhabitants relied on international aid before war25 Oct 2023Campaigners aim to lower support for China on UN human rights council8 Oct 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This opposition prevented the resolution from reaching the nine votes needed to pass. Activists argued that Russia’s proposal weakened existing commitments on human rights, conflict-related sexual violence, and women’s equal involvement in peace efforts.

The NGO Working Group on Women, Peace, and Security, among other advocacy groups, praised the countries that opposed the resolution. They saw the stance as a strong commitment to protecting and advancing women’s rights globally, particularly in the context of the 20th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325. This landmark resolution recognized the unique impacts of conflict on women and advocated for their equal role in peace processes.

Despite the progress made over two decades, gaps in the implementation of women’s rights persist, and some recent international developments reflect a rollback in these areas. For example, a German-led resolution addressing wartime rape only passed after removing specific references to sexual and reproductive health due to U.S. opposition.

In the vote on Russia’s resolution, countries like China, South Africa, Vietnam, and Indonesia sided with Russia. Nonetheless, the widespread opposition highlighted a continued commitment among many nations to resist any erosion of the gains made in women’s rights in conflict-affected areas."
Abortion is not just wrong. It is anti-feminist too - Mary Camilleri,"Abortion is not just wrong. It is anti-feminist too - Mary Camilleri Foreigners are shocked at how deprived we are is a favourite taunt of the pro-abortion lobby. There must be something wrong with us, the taunt goes, if the rest of the civilised world has abortion and we do not. Thats the gist of it. What if, in fact, its the other way around? I actually like to think that, for once, we got it right. Perhaps we can attribute any tiny residue of compassion and respect remaining in our society to our pro-life stance. When it comes to the crunch, most of us, liberal or conservative, Nationalist or Labourite or neither, all seem to balk at the idea of abortion. Two recent quasi-identical news items in Times of Malta and l-Orizzont claimed that a UK organisation, the Abortion Support Network, has had an increase in requests from Maltese women unable to travel due to the coronavirus pandemic. One assumes that the women were referred to the organisation by a local body, but none is mentioned, perhaps because such referral is illegal? The husband of Lara Dimitrijevic is quoted, but otherwise no local feminist groups or individuals voice an opinion, so the article must simply have appeared on the desks of the newspapers in question. Dimitrijevic herself is not quoted at all. Perhaps she was busy. The Abortion Support Network says the increase in requests from Malta was due to two factors. One was the suspension of flights, since people who planned to go away for an abortion were unable to do so. In such cases, the representative said, women become frantic and might seek an unsafe alternative. The case of the Irish woman who tried to commit suicide because she was prevented from going to the UK to abort was cited by Dimitrijevic. Now perhaps wealthy women in Malta will know what its like for everyone else who cant just hop on a plane, he added. So, the coronavirus, of all things, is being used to justify abortion. In addition to the suspension of flights, another ill-effect of the lockdown is that women in abusive relationships are forced to spend more time with their partners, and are more likely to have an unwanted pregnancy, and consequently want an abortion. This is presented as a given. So the evil of the coronavirus and the evil of domestic violence are to be remedied, the article implies, by a third evil, the evil of abortion. Abortion is inherently anti-feminist, because instead of celebrating maternity it relegates it to secondary status The Abortion Support Network cannot be expected to care about women trapped in abusive relationships. Presumably they get paid for their services and, for them, it stops there. Cynical, but true. What about us though? For those of us who care the slightest bit about womens well-being, surely what should worry us most is the level of domestic violence in our midst. Why are women still having to stay in toxic relationships, risking their lives and those of their children? How can we tolerate, even feed, this macho culture? I write close to the anniversary of the death of Sylvia King, a woman killed in cold blood because she defended her friend against a husbands brutality. A short paragraph announced a Mass in memory of an unsung heroine whose name speaks to me of solidarity, selflessness, love, bravery and so much more. The way she died, burnt alive in a car, is too similar for us not to think of another martyr, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who died because she told the truth about government corruption, defending not just one person but a whole nation. Both deaths are a chilling reminder that some people will not tolerate women who take a stand. Many women face the stark choice your acquiescence or your life. Abortion is presented as a womans choice to do what she wants with her own body. Yet, a woman who is living in fear for her very existence is unlikely to have the luxury of even the most basic choices. In a situation of abuse, how freely would such a choice be made? What if she doesnt want an abortion and is forced to have one? Is that OK, because the choice is to abort? And in the unlikely event that she is able to choose freely, how could self-inflicted physical violence heal mental scars from physical violence inflicted by someone else? The damage to her integrity can only be worsened by surgical intervention that strikes at the very heart of her being, of her identity as a woman. I am unapologetically anti-abortion, believing it to be intrinsically wrong and against the principle of the right to life, an overriding principle superior to all other rights. I also believe that it is inherently anti-feminist, because instead of celebrating maternity it relegates it to secondary status. Of course, this is a minority view in most of the rest of the world but most of them dont remember a time when abortion wasnt available. How would they know? If only true solidarity existed. The likes of Sylvia King are few and far between, but her heroism stands out in stark contrast with the fake compassion of the Abortion Support Network. All our intelligence and energy should be focussed on making sure that no woman should ever feel afraid in her own home. The combination of our macho culture with the growing phenomena of white slavery and the exploitation of women in brothels and domestic service, now with a recession looming, is toxic. I urge organisations such as Women for Women to focus their good intentions and their energy on the real threats that women face.

She challenges the pro-abortion view that sees Malta’s lack of abortion services as backward, asserting that the nation’s pro-life stance reflects a compassionate and respectful society. Camilleri references recent articles about the Abortion Support Network (ASN), which reported increased inquiries from Maltese women unable to travel for abortion services during the COVID-19 lockdown. Camilleri suggests that the ASN, portrayed as a profit-driven organization, fails to genuinely support women, especially those in abusive relationships who lack freedom of choice and security.

Camilleri criticizes the argument that the pandemic and domestic violence create a need for abortion. She contends that treating abortion as a solution to domestic abuse and unwanted pregnancies compounds harm, framing abortion as “the third evil” alongside COVID-19 and abuse. For her, true feminism values and celebrates maternity rather than viewing it as secondary, making abortion a fundamentally anti-feminist act. Camilleri also expresses concern about Malta’s broader societal issues, including “macho culture,” domestic abuse, and sex trafficking. She honors Sylvia King, a woman murdered for defending a friend from abuse, as an example of true compassion and solidarity.

Concluding, Camilleri urges feminist organizations to address these “real threats” to women’s safety and dignity rather than supporting abortion access. She believes the pro-life position better respects women’s well-being and societal compassion, despite being a minority view globally."
People to Watch: Dr. Matthew Phillips runs Life on Wheels,"People to Watch Dr. Matthew Phillips runs Life on WheelsNews Sports Business Go Play Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals NEWSDr. Matthew Phillips says Life on Wheels clinics support women facing pregnancy crises Hadley HitsonMontgomery AdvertiserDr. Matthew Phillips loves babies. He and his wife, Camille, have had four of their own, and Phillips has spent his adult life delivering them for mothers across Montgomery. Theres just something about an innocent child entering the world that will make you so hopeful, he said. In January of this year, though, Phillips decided to quit his job as an obstetrician, which meant no more delivering babies. It wasnt because he no longer loved taking care of babies, nor did he want to leave the hospital. Instead, he resolved to help babies by helping their moms first. Phillips founded Life on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that provides free ultrasounds and pregnancy tests to women in Montgomery and Birmingham through three mobile clinics. These services cost 150 and 25 respectively at local clinics. He currently serves as the Life on Wheels president and continues to work as a gynecologist from his office on Taylor Road. I realized the power of ultrasound in empowering a woman to make a decision about her pregnancy, Phillips said. It does change your life, a child, but just like all crises in our lives, if someone can step alongside you and help you, most crises can be overcome. So that's kind of what we do with the bus.The Montgomery-based Life On Wheels bus parks across the street from abortion providers, pro-life pregnancy centers and on the Alabama State University campus throughout the week.The organization itself is staunchly against abortion, and while the nonprofit workers hope each woman will decide to parent, Phillips said the function of Life On Wheels is not to advocate against it. He said their volunteers and employees do not berate women or picket in front of abortion clinics. We're unashamedly pro-life, and we'd like to see abortion go away, but that's not the purpose of our bus. Our bus is to love women where they are and meet them where they are. We think that's the way Christ would do it, Phillips said. Life on Wheels executive director Robyn Blessing seconded Phillips's statement. She said the women who staff the bus every day set up signs and pass out coupons advertising the free services, but they don't engage in political conversations or pro-life versus pro-choice debates. ""It's not our job to talk a woman into or out of an abortion,"" Blessing said. ""We aren't going to overstep another physician, and if they do choose to abort, we still love them.""Blessing met Phillips several years ago, after she had gotten an abortion herself, and he is one of the most genuine people she knows. ""He is selfless and nonjudgmental,"" she said. ""He really lives what he believes.""Raising a child is a large responsibility, but when a woman who utilizes Life On Wheels resources struggles to stay afloat, Phillips said his organization does everything it can to help her. He told the story of one of their former patients who lost her job and almost lost her house after giving birth. When she called the organization for help, one of the board members was able to get Catholic Social Services to pay two months of her rent, and she ultimately got her job back. Thats when were doing our job really well, Phillips said. It is a unique story, though, I confess. Weve seen over 5,000 women, so if we were doing that for every single one of them, it would be a lot. The usual outcome of a woman getting an ultrasound from Life On Wheels is that she either decides to parent and gets connected with a local pregnancy center or she decides to continue with her abortion.Either way, Phillips said he hopes his team is making a positive impact. Since Life on Wheels opened its first mobile medical unit in the River Region on Dec. 27, 2016, it has seen over 4,400 clients in the area. Many of them had decided to parent their babies before visiting the unit, but Life on Wheels records show that 284 women changed their minds about getting an abortion after the ultrasound. When Phillips started Life on Wheels, his goal was to have a mobile pregnancy clinic across the street from every abortion clinic in the state. Now, he has two cities left that he wants to expand into Tuscaloosa and Huntsville. As the right to an abortion continues to be debated on a national scale, Phillips has no plans to delve into the politics of women's health and abortion access. Instead, he hopes to stay focused on growing his nonprofit and resolving misconceptions around his work. ""We're not angry,"" he said. ""We love the woman. We love the baby. We love the people across the street.""About the seriesThe Montgomery Advertiser's People to Watch is a series of stories about everyday Alabamians we believe will do exceptional things in our communities in the coming year. Our readers and journalists nominated this year's slate. The Advertiser will publish profiles about these honorees from Dec. 23 through early January.Three questions with Dr. Matthew PhillipsWhat is Montgomery's greatest attribute?""I think the reason that I love the city is we are sitting, in this time in history, in a better position to impact our nation on the issues that affect our nation than any city in America. ""Could Montgomery be the one city that could say, 'If we can change, if we can bring reconciliation to this city, if this city can be reconciled, then our whole country could be reconciled?' So to me, that's the coolest thing about being in Montgomery. We have the potential to impact the country and maybe even the world on the issue of racial reconciliation.""What did the pandemic teach you about yourself?""I learned a lot about fear. I think the whole pandemic is plagued with fear. Fear of death, fear of losing a family member, fear of the vaccine, the whole thing is plagued with fear, and we made a lot of decisions based on fear, some good, some bad. ""But I learned a lot about dealing with fear and in trusting God that he has a sovereign plan for my life.""Name somebody in the community who inspires you.""John Geiger inspires me. He was the headmaster at Eastwood Christian School and about two years ago now died of ALS. He was inspiring me long before he got ALS, but then when he got ALS, he showed me how to die and how to die well.""Hadley Hitson covers the rural South for the Montgomery Advertiser and Report for America.

This service, typically costing $150 for an ultrasound and $25 for a pregnancy test, is provided at no charge in Montgomery and Birmingham. Phillips, motivated by a desire to support women facing crisis pregnancies, believes that ultrasounds empower women by providing them with information to make decisions regarding their pregnancies. Life on Wheels’ mobile units are often stationed near abortion providers and on university campuses, aiming to offer supportive services without engaging in political debates.

Phillips and Life on Wheels Executive Director Robyn Blessing emphasize a compassionate, non-judgmental approach. Staff members provide information and assistance without attempting to dissuade women from choosing abortion, maintaining that their primary goal is to “love women where they are.” This approach has led to significant community impact; since launching its first mobile unit in 2016, Life on Wheels has served over 5,000 clients, with 284 women reportedly choosing to continue their pregnancies after receiving ultrasounds.

Phillips shares stories of providing further assistance when needed, such as helping a client secure housing support during financial hardship. His broader aim is to expand the service to Tuscaloosa and Huntsville. Phillips intentionally avoids political involvement, focusing instead on his nonprofit’s mission to offer empathetic support to women. He views this work as part of a larger commitment to making a positive impact on his community, particularly around issues like racial reconciliation, which he considers a defining opportunity for Montgomery.

Phillips also reflects on how the pandemic deepened his understanding of fear, teaching him to trust in a larger plan. Inspired by community figures like John Geiger, former headmaster of Eastwood Christian School, Phillips’s life and work exemplify resilience and compassion, qualities recognized in the Montgomery Advertiser’s “People to Watch” series, which highlights notable community members poised to make meaningful contributions."

Read more opinion on CNN. CNN Congress has the chance to enact groundbreaking legislation, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act PWFA, that would close a dangerous gap in protections for pregnant workers. Without this bill, employers can discriminate against pregnant workers who need common-sense help, denying them exemptions from heavy lifting, as well as bathroom or water breaks sometimes at the cost of their jobs and health. The PWFA would solve this problem by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers that do not impose undue hardship on employers. With support from both the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops USCCB and the American Civil Liberties Union, the bipartisan PWFA is a legislative unicorn a bill that Americans who disagree about abortion, like the four of us, can rally behind. St. Paul, Minnesota. July 17, 2022. Thousands march and rally in support of legal abortion access after the U.S. Supreme court overturned the federal constitutional right to an abortion. Anti and pro demonstraters hold up signs showing their different opinions. Anti demonstrators yelling that Jesus would not forgive them. Photo by Michael SilukUCGUniversal Images Group via Getty Images Michael SilukUCGUniversal Images GroupGetty Images Related article Opinion The conflicts in a post-Roe America are just beginning And were not alone. Bipartisan support on the issue reflects the widely shared belief that pregnant workers deserve the accommodations they need. The bill has the votes to pass, and it may be now or never. But the bill has stalled in the Senate due to disagreements about how it relates to abortion, just as both chambers are set to recess in the coming week. Its not too late, however, for Congress to find a way through this impasse and help pregnant workers. Historically, it was commonplace for employers to fire pregnant women. A married womans sphere is in the home, if she has a family, an editorial explained in 1911. Employers assumed that any pregnant worker would and should leave the workforce upon becoming a parent. And assumptions about work during and after pregnancy gave workers a zero-sum choice give up a badly-needed job or find a way to end a pregnancy. That is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. It is fundamentally unjust, and yet, the Supreme Court held in the 1970s that pregnancy discrimination was constitutional and did not violate federal civil rights law. But that was intolerable to the coalition of pro-choice and pro-life advocates who fought for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act PDA. Abortion-rights supporters stressed that real reproductive choice involves not just the right not to have a child but also the ability to bear and raise children without sacrificing the means to make a living. Activists opposed to abortion recognized that supporting pregnant workers would mean fewer abortions and stronger families. PHILADELPHIA, PA - JULY 13 U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about voting rights at the National Constitution Center on July 13, 2021 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Biden and Congressional Democrats are set to make another push for sweeping voting rights legislation as Republican state legislatures across the country continue to pass controversial voting access laws. Photo by Drew AngererGetty Images Drew AngererGetty Images Opinion It's time for Democrats to take a page from the GOP playbook The coalition sought through the PDA to reduce economic pressures that might lead to an abortion. Thanks to this unlikely alliance, Congress passed the PDA in 1978, reasoning that the assumption that women will become pregnant and leave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyping. But in the years since, its become clear that the PDA is broken. As courts interpret the law today, it does not require employers to accommodate anyone it only demands that employers extend the same protections to pregnant workers that are offered to employees similar in their ability to work. That means employers can avoid problems simply by denying everyone protections. Worse, judges commonly shut down claims because an employee cant find a precise enough comparator an employee similar in ability or inability to work. As the House observed Forcing pregnant workers to identify a comparator creates an oftentimes insurmountable hurdle. The results for pregnant workers have been devastating. As the New York Times recently documented, pregnancy discrimination harms a range of workers across the pay scale, from Walmart to Wall Street. Sometimes, just asking for a simple accommodation triggers a reprisal. A study published in 2011 found that a quarter of women were fired or quit when they bore a child. TO GO WITH STORY BY KARYN POUPEE A pregnant woman works at her office in Tokyo on July 2, 2013. Pregnant women or young mothers, many Japanese say they are victims of ""mata-hara"" a name for ""maternity harassment"" of mothers in employment, an attic in an aging country in dire need of babies. AFP PHOTO Yoshikazu TSUNO Photo credit should read YOSHIKAZU TSUNOAFPGetty Images Yoshikazu TsunoAFPGetty Images video Related video New study finds 4 out of 5 pregnancy deaths in the US are preventable And the problem hasnt stopped. The chain Circle K just settled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for 8 million, following an investigation that revealed multiple workers were fired or forced to take unpaid leave because they were pregnant. Other lawsuits tell a similar story. A restaurant in Louisiana fired a worker the same day it hired her after learning she was pregnant. A human resources employee was fired the same day she learned that she required accommodations for a high-risk pregnancy. Stories of workers being fired or mistreated due to pregnancy are everywhere on Twitter, Reddit and TikTok, and thats no surprise. Research suggests that a quarter million pregnant workers are denied accommodations each year and nearly 40 dont even feel confident enough to ask their employers for accommodations in the first place. Even when workers denied accommodations are not fired, they must endure serious potential health risks. Failure to accommodate can drastically increase the chance of miscarriage, whether through forcing pregnant women to perform demanding manual labor or exposing them to toxic chemicals. Even so, employers win 66 of the pregnancy discrimination cases filed against them and some studies estimate that only 1 of workers facing discrimination ever file a claim. The PWFA would help to solve this problem by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers. But the bipartisan alliance in support of the bill is now threatened by disagreements concerning the bills potential impact on abortion. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook Nearly 50 years ago, the pro-lifepro-choice coalition in support of the PDA also had to work out a variety of disagreements that stood in the way of that laws passage. But work out their differences they did. We urge members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to come to an accord regarding these concerns before they recess for the holidays. Finding a way forward for the PWFA, at this time of pervasive political polarization, would not only be a vital gift to pregnant women and their families. It would also give us all a sliver of hope that Washington still works for the benefit of all American people.

CNN Sans 2016 Cable News Network.","The article advocates for the passage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), which aims to protect pregnant workers by requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations without imposing undue hardship on businesses. This bill is important because it addresses widespread discrimination against pregnant workers who may be denied essential accommodations like lighter duties or bathroom breaks, leading to job loss or health risks.

The bill enjoys bipartisan support, drawing backing from both the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the American Civil Liberties Union, despite differing views on abortion. This rare unity shows that supporting pregnant workers transcends the abortion debate. The bill has stalled in the Senate, partly due to concerns about its relation to abortion policy, but advocates urge Congress to pass the law before the year ends.

Historically, pregnant women faced discrimination in the workplace, with many losing jobs or being forced to choose between pregnancy and employment. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978 aimed to protect workers in these situations, but its implementation has been flawed. The PWFA seeks to fix these gaps by requiring accommodations for pregnant workers without forcing them to identify a similar employee to compare against. Pregnancy discrimination continues to harm workers across various industries, and many women still face retaliation when requesting accommodations.

The article stresses that passing the PWFA would not only benefit pregnant workers but also serve as a rare example of bipartisan cooperation, offering hope amid political polarization."

It called on armed groups to take special measures to protect women and girls from rape and sexual abuse, and urged governments to prosecute those who committed these crimes.It also called for more funding for local womens groups, and for greater protection for women and girls in refugee settings.The past 20 years has seen slow progress. More women now sit at the negotiating table, but gender parity is a distant dream. Between 1992 and 2019, women constituted, on average, 13 of negotiators, 6 of mediators and 6 of signatories to major peace agreements. Women constitute fewer than 5 of the 95,000 active UN peacekeepers and about 11 of police in UN missions.Sexual violence is rife in conflict, but prosecutions are rare. The UN is concerned that Covid-19 will increase the risk of sexual exploitation, abuse, child marriage, and trafficking among displaced women and girls.Since 2000, the security council has adopted a further nine resolutions on women, peace and security. Another is expected this year.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since then the security council has adopted nine further resolutions on women and security at least five have a specific focus on the use of rape as a weapon of war.But there are huge gaps in implementation. Between 1992 and 2019, women have made up an average of 13 of negotiators, 6 of mediators and 6 of signatories in major peace processes.The recent rollback on womens rights globally has made further progress difficult.Last year a resolution introduced by Germany to combat wartime rape was only passed when references in the text to sexual and reproductive health and rights were removed to suit the US.Vanessa Jackson, UN representative for the NGO Care International, said We very much feel that when you reach the 20th year of bedding down a whole framework and 10 security council resolutions to try to advance womens right to be involved in peace and security, you can begin to look at what are the gaps and how do we address them and there are many gaps in implementation.But what we have been seeing in the past couple of years is the women, peace and security agenda has become another battleground for womens human rights. The pushback were seeing globally is happening in the council.Hannah Bond, director of Gender Action for Peace and Security, added 2020 marks an important milestone for women, peace and security. It should have focused on implementation of the many commitments not yet met by the international community, including the urgent need for more funding to support womens and girls rights in conflict.'Be afraid' one womans fight to hold Liberias warlords to accountRead moreVoting is expected to play out along geopolitical lines, with China backing Russia, which currently holds the presidency of the security council. It is unclear how the UK and other western states, including France and the US, will vote.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said We will not accept any backsliding on this vital agenda and are working with our partners to ensure the resolution upholds the progress made on womens rights over the last 20 years.At Thursdays meeting, British minister James Cleverly is expected to announce funding to support female mediators.The Russian mission to the UN did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsPeace and reconciliationWomen's rights and gender equalityUnited NationsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This move comes as the international community prepares to mark the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325, which first acknowledged the unique and disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls, and called for their equal participation in peacebuilding, negotiations, and reconstruction.

While there has been slow progress since the resolution’s adoption in 2000, with more women now involved in peace processes, gender parity remains far from reach. Women still make up only a small fraction of peace negotiators, mediators, and UN peacekeepers, and sexual violence in conflict persists with few prosecutions. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated risks such as sexual exploitation, child marriage, and trafficking for displaced women and girls.

Despite adopting several resolutions over the years to address these issues, implementation remains weak. Recent efforts to advance women’s rights in peace and security have faced setbacks, such as the removal of references to sexual and reproductive health in a 2019 resolution on wartime rape. Geopolitical tensions complicate these debates, with countries like China backing Russia’s position, while the UK and other Western states are working to maintain the progress made over the last two decades.

A local South Carolina council member is ditching the Democratic Party and running for reelection as a Republican. ""Some things that I had looked at, I just don't agree with any longer,"" Dorchester County council member Harriet Holman told ""Fox Friends First"" on Wednesday. ""One of the things was that I am just totally pro-life, and I am by for capitalism, I am for funding the police. Those things are what made me make my final decision,"" she told host Todd Piro.

His argument is that Democrats need to stop focusing on ""political correctness"" and ""culture wars."" Holman argued that one of the biggest things Democrats should be focused on is inflation. ""This is the highest inflation we've had since 1982, I believe, and then we're talking about gas prices, which we may see a 4 gas price here in this year, alone.

Market data provided by","Harriet Holman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and Dorchester County council member in South Carolina, announced her decision to switch from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party while running for reelection. Holman explained that her shift was motivated by her strong stance on being pro-life, supporting capitalism, and advocating for increased police funding—values she felt were not aligned with the Democratic Party’s current direction.

Holman, who grew up in a Democratic family, said her political views evolved after she retired from the military and became more involved in local community issues. She expressed dissatisfaction with Democratic policies and felt compelled to make the change. Holman emphasized that the decision was not easy but involved discussions with family, friends, and constituents. Despite this, she found the transition to the Republican Party relatively smooth, given her family’s Republican leanings.

Holman also noted her concern over economic issues, particularly inflation and high gas prices, which she believes should be the Democratic Party’s primary focus. She argued that addressing these concerns is critical to supporting the needs of her constituents. Holman is confident in her decision and believes that the Republican Party will see growth, especially within African-American communities."

AP Anti-abortion activists from across the U.S. converged in southern New Mexico on Tuesday to protest relocation plans by the Mississippi clinic at the center of the court battle that overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, but New Mexicos governor vowed not to back down from her support for access to abortions.Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is running for reelection, tweeted hours before the protest that access remains legal and safe in her state.New Mexicans understand the right to make personal decisions about ones own reproductive health care and we wont go back, she wrote.The crowd gathered in triple-digit temperatures in the southern city of Las Cruces, near the location where Jackson Womens Health Organization plans to open its new clinic next week. Some held signs that read Pray to End Abortion and Vote Your Values. They heard from the leader of a local Catholic parish, a university student group and activists from Texas and Mississippi who talked about their experiences shutting down abortion clinics elsewhere. Terri Herring, president of Mississippi-based group Choose Life, told the crowd about more than two dozen pregnancy centers in her state that have helped mothers who were considering abortion but opted to have their babies instead. We need to make this a refuge for women and their children, she said of New Mexico, before organizers of the rally announced they would open a Guiding Star Project clinic next door to the planned abortion clinic. The facility will provide fertility care, pregnancy and childbirth support services as alternatives to the abortions planned for the former Mississippi clinic next door. Leah Jacobson, founder and CEO of The Guiding Star Project, told the crowd that the root causes of what is driving women to abortion need to be addressed and that a culture shift is needed to counter what she described as a loss of bodily autonomy through devices, pills, drugs and surgeries. If we love life, if we want to protect women and children, we need to understand that there is something fundamentally broken about how we are treating motherhood in our culture, she said, pointing to the lack of maternity leave or breastfeeding spaces, among other challenges. How about we actually take the needs of women into consideration?New Mexicos Democratic-controlled Legislature supports access, and state lawmakers last year repealed a dormant 1969 law that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the Supreme Court rolled back the national guarantee.Preparations are well underway for the new abortion clinic, with furniture and equipment from Jackson Womens Health Organization moved from Mississippi, and it is due to open soon.Were just trying to tie up loose ends, Diane Derzis, owner of Las Cruces Womens Health Organization, told The Associated Press on Monday. Derzis said Tuesdays demonstration against the abortion clinic didnt bother her since protests have gone for years at other clinics she has owned in Mississippi and elsewhere. Its not a big deal, she said. Thats life at an abortion clinic.Associated Press writers Susan Montoya Bryan, in Albuquerque, and Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this report.","In Las Cruces, New Mexico, anti-abortion activists from across the United States gathered to protest the relocation of the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a Mississippi clinic central to the case that overturned Roe v. Wade. The clinic is set to open in New Mexico, a state where abortion access remains legal and supported by Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. Prior to the protest, the governor reiterated her commitment to maintaining access to abortion services in the state.

The protesters, who endured hot temperatures, heard from various speakers, including leaders from local religious groups and activists from Mississippi and Texas who discussed their experiences closing abortion clinics. They also announced the opening of a new pro-life clinic called the Guiding Star Project next to the relocated abortion clinic. The project aims to provide alternative services, such as fertility care and childbirth support, and advocates for addressing the societal issues that lead women to seek abortions, such as insufficient maternity leave and lack of breastfeeding facilities.

New Mexico’s Democratic-controlled legislature has worked to safeguard abortion access by repealing a law that had previously made most abortion procedures a felony. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization clinic is close to opening, with equipment already moved from Mississippi. Despite the protests, Diane Derzis, the owner of Las Cruces Women’s Health Organization, dismissed the demonstration as routine, noting that abortion clinics often face protests."

Shutterstock Sign up for Route Fifty Today Your daily read on state and local government emailFeatured eBooks By Emma Coleman December 11, 2020 The country already has a patchwork of different restrictions on abortion. How would that change in a post-Roe world? Women's Rights Health Care Supreme Court State and Federal Relations When Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court in October, many legal analysts began speculating about what might happen when the now solidly conservative court considers an abortion case that could overturn Roe v. Wade. Some argued Barretts confirmation was a death knell for reproductive rights, while others said her adherence to legal precedent means it isnt clear that she would back a wholesale overturning of Roe.One thing everyone agreed on Barretts addition to the court certainly increases the chance of overturning or weakening the landmark 1973 decision finding that abortion access is a constitutional right. If the court does throw out Roe, ten states, including Arkansas, South Dakota, and Missouri, are waiting in the wings with laws known as trigger banslegislation already on the books that makes abortion illegal in the event of a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe. State lawmakers first began debating these trigger laws during legislative sessions in 2005 and 2006 and have picked them up again in the past two years. The measures were likely designed as a way for states to pass legislation showing they did not support abortion without inspiring litigation that would cost them money, said Elizabeth Nash, the associate director of state issues at the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization.Some would go into effect immediately if Roe is overturned, while others have a 30-day waiting period. A few require the state attorney general to do a certification process. All these steps can happen relatively quickly, Nash said. Were talking weeks, not years.In that immediate post-Roe world, legal abortion access would effectively end for people living in the deep South and parts of the Midwest, where the trigger bans are clustered. An additional seven states have pre-Roe bans on abortion that could go into effect through a legal process called revival or if a prosecutor in the state tries to enforce the old statute in a post-Roe world. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have laws that protect the right to abortion and might see a surge in people crossing state lines to access providersbut the challenge for many women, especially women of color, young adults, and low income women, will be getting there at all. Were not talking about going to the next state, were talking about crossing two or three states to access abortion, from Louisiana all the way up to Virginia. Thats a pretty substantial undertaking, said Nash. In a lot of states, abortion access is already extremely limited and the meaning of Roe is gone already. Thats the reality. Certainly if it were to be overturned, that reality spreads.Caitlin Knowles Myers, an economist at Middlebury College who has studied the potential impacts of overturning Roe, said that to picture what this new world would look like, just take a look at the past. In 1972, the year before Roe became the law of the land, New York was one of the few places women could get a legal abortion. Over 100,000 women came to New York City from other states that year to get an abortion. Some doctors in the state offered an abortion bundle that included the price of a flight. Its an interesting historical perspective, Myers said. Overturning Roe could return power to the states in the same way.But thats all if Roe is completely dismantled. Most experts agree thatwhile noting they are purely speculating about a court largely untested in this legal arenaits more likely the Supreme Court will take a piecemeal approach when considering new restrictions on abortion. Melanie Israel, a researcher with the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that Clarence Thomas is the only justice who has explicitly said the court should overturn Roe. For all the talk about how conservative the court is, that doesn't automatically mean theres five or six votes, she said. We also have to look at the specific cases winding their way to the court. Historically speaking, we havent seen an appetite for an abortion case every single term but theres been a recent wave of pro-life laws at the state level that spur these lawsuits.There are 18 cases that could make it to the Supreme Court and impact Roe, according to data compiled by Planned Parenthood. They include challenges to a Mississippi law that would impose a 15-week ban on abortions, Texas and Kentucky laws that would ban an abortion procedure commonly used after sixteen weeks of pregnancy, and a Louisiana law that would people from seeking an abortion after learning the fetus is diabnosed with Down syndrome.A decision in one of these cases that restricts access to abortion, but doesnt actually overturn Roe, likely wouldnt trigger a state ban, even though some of the state measuressay they go into effect if Roe is overturned in whole or in part. More likely, states could take a narrow court rulinglike one that would allow Louisiana to ban abortions for a Down syndrome diagnosisand use it to pass broader restrictions. This could mean, for example, passing a reason ban on all abortions for fetal diagnoses or sex because a state assumes that the entire category has been blessed by the Supreme Court, said Jessica Arons, the senior advocacy and policy counsel for reproductive freedom at the ACLU.Some state legislatures might simply re-introduce laws that were rejected by lower courts in recent years. One example could be bans on allowing advanced practice clinicians like nurse practitioners to perform abortions, which have been struck down in states like Montana, and requirements that abortion providers meet the same requirements as ambulatory surgical centers that have been struck down in states like Louisiana and Texas.These types of supply side restrictions that affect clinics make providing abortions more costlyand evidence from places like Texas proves that when costs get too high, providers close their doors. Anytime states pass these restrictions, what youre going to see is fewer providers in rural areas in particular, and a smaller number of providers in big cities, Myers said. As clinics close, costs also go up for abortion seekers who have to travel longer distances to find care. The cost of gas or a plane ticket, childcare, and time off work could add up to several hundred dollars, or even reach into the thousands. These costs all increase if the closest clinic is in a state with demand side restrictions like a mandatory waiting period between a consultation and the abortion procedure. Whether abortion seekers will be able to absorb those costs is unknown. If Roe is overturned, we know a large number of women in affected areas aren't going to be able to reach a provider, Myers said. What we don't know is what they do next.There isnt nearly as much data or analysis on what happens when women want and cant get an abortion. Some may end up giving birth, some may attempt to self-induce, and some may turn to black market providers. An area of increasing interest to researchers is whether women will turn to online pharmacies for abortion pillssomething that is already starting to happen in states with tighter restrictions or, as in Texas, women on the border have turned to Mexican pharmacies. States that want to stop online pill sales face an uphill battle preventing drug shipments from unlicensed, foreign providers.President-elect Joe Biden, who during his campaign vowed to codify Roe and stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate Roe, might try several strategies at the federal level to increase abortion access. He might push for the Womens Health Protection Act, a bill co-sponsored by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris that would limit the abortion restrictions states can implement, or establish federal preclearance rules to screen state abortion laws as the federal government did for voting laws after the passage of the Voting Rights Act. But Nash noted that it will be difficult to keep states from banning abortion if the Supreme Court allows them to do so.Its up to each state to see what the lay of the land would look like, said Israel, with Heritage. Weve seen so many pro-life laws at the state level in the last decade, and thats happening because people are consistently electing those legislators to office. Theyre not pumping the brakes. And during all this, of course, there are some states moving in the opposite direction, passing constitutional amendments that guarantee a right to abortion should federal rights disappear. This is primarily happening on the West Coast and in the Northeast, but also in states like Virginia and Illinois. We cant overlook the importance of state constitutions, said Arons with the ACLU. The constitutional rights afforded under the federal constitution are a floor, not a ceiling. Emma Coleman is the assistant editor for Route Fifty.

Sign up","The article discusses the potential impact of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, particularly in states with “trigger laws.” These laws, passed in anticipation of such a decision, would immediately ban abortion if Roe is overturned. Ten states, including Arkansas, South Dakota, and Missouri, have these trigger bans, with some laws going into effect immediately and others requiring a short waiting period or action by the state attorney general. The trigger laws would lead to the end of legal abortion in the South and parts of the Midwest.

In addition to trigger laws, seven states have pre-Roe abortion bans that could be revived, further restricting abortion access. On the other hand, 13 states and the District of Columbia have protections for abortion rights, but women in states where abortion is banned may have to travel long distances to access care. This creates additional barriers, particularly for women of color, young adults, and low-income women.

Historically, before Roe legalized abortion, women traveled to states like New York for legal abortions. If Roe is overturned, it could lead to a resurgence of this pattern. However, most experts believe that the Supreme Court may take a gradual approach to restricting abortion rather than overturning Roe entirely. Legal challenges to state laws, such as Mississippi’s 15-week ban and Texas’s restrictions on certain abortion procedures, could reshape the legal landscape.

The article also notes that state laws could include “supply-side restrictions” that increase the costs of abortion, leading to fewer providers, especially in rural areas. Women might face higher costs for travel, childcare, and time off work, and some may turn to online pharmacies for abortion pills.

Federal responses under President Joe Biden, including the Women’s Health Protection Act, may aim to protect abortion access, but overturning Roe could make it difficult to stop state-level bans. Some states have moved in the opposite direction, passing amendments to protect abortion rights, primarily in the West Coast and Northeast.

In conclusion, while some states are preparing for an immediate end to abortion access, others are strengthening protections, and the broader national landscape could shift depending on Supreme Court decisions and legislative actions at the state level."

Included below are the four spiciest pro-choice memes, and four spiciest pro-life memes. Ive given each of them my own spiciness rating and broken down why they failsucceed on an objective level. PRO-CHOICE MEMES It is incredibly evident that this pro-choice meme is theologically incorrect, and the creator of the meme has little understanding of Christianity. Firstly, it is true that God has granted all human beings free will, which permits individuals to make their own choices, and yet, human beings have the capacity to sin. Simply because one has the capacity to make a choice does not make the action moral. Morality is not subjective. Secondly, Gods word in Jeremiah 15 clearly states, Before I formed you in your mothers body, I chose you. God creates all humans and attributes them innate purpose before theyre born. The God mentioned in this meme is not the true God of Christians. In this meme, comedian Morgan Murphy claims that just like having children, abortions are not for everybody, implying that abortions could be for some people when really, they shouldnt be for anybody. Some people are not ready to become parents yet, but continue to engage in sexual lifestyles that can result in the creation of children. The murder of their children, by means of abortion, is simply viewed as a collateral damage. Unfortunately, abortion is being promoted as a means of back-up birth control, since sex is no longer viewed as a procreational act. Murphy may be granting that killing is not for everybody, but in doing so, reduces the debate to a question of abortions palatability, instead of objective morality. You may not want children, but there are many families that do. Adoption is the loving option. Interestingly, this meme is admitting that abortion eliminates children from society. Let me introduce you to the epitome of disturbing pro-abortion memes, compliments of Dank Pro-Choice Memes which puts out gruesome baby-hating content to their 16,000 followers. The creator is claiming that when a woman faces an unexpected pregnancy, the child in her womb is simply a mistake that should be disposed of. The meme also has the effect of discouraging women from mourning the loss of their aborted children, by telling women not to be emotionally attached. This is detrimental to women who have had abortions since grieving is a natural human phenomenon, especially after the loss of a child. The smiling woman in the meme conceals the fact that abortion causes women to suffer psychologically. No human being is a mistake and abortion is not a simple and harmless procedure. Again, morality is objective. If something is believed to be immoral, we, as Christians, have an obligation to fight for justice. This is like saying, If you dont like slavery, dont own a slave. This is not about whether we like a particular human rights abuse or not! The real hard pill to swallow is accepting that abortion is immoral, not just a matter of preference. Furthermore, women do not need abortion since abortion is never medically necessary. Check out the Dublin Declaration on Maternal Healthcare, which is signed by over one thousand medical professionals. PRO-LIFE MEMES Many pro-abortion advocates completely dismiss basic biology and embryology in order to maintain their positions. Embryology textbooks tell us that, In that fraction of a second when the chromosomes form pairs, the sex of the new child will be determined, hereditary characteristics received from each parent will be set, and a new life will have begun. Scientific facts cannot be dismissed and truly prove, time and time again, that fetuses are human beings and are alive. Of course pro-choicers wouldnt be happy to be reminded of that! For more quotations from medical textbooks stating that life begins at fertilization, see this collection. This meme demonstrates how pro-choicers often resort to ad hominem fallacies, or attacks on ones character. The use of insults instead of valid arguments only creates divisiveness within debates. Identity politics has become incredibly prominent within our society and promotes an ideology in which a persons identity makes their argument more or less valid. Morality, however, does not magically change depending on ones identity. Who a pro-lifer is whether theyre a good person or not is actually irrelevant to the question of whether abortion is right or wrong. Historically, the elimination or oppression of a group of people begins first with their dehumanization. By claiming that some humans lack personhood, it becomes much easier to exploit and eliminate them. It is literally a slide into darkness and destruction. The truth is that all human beings are persons, regardless of their race, ethnicity, level of development, etc. All living things are made up of one or more cells that is a biological fact. The definition of a clump is a compacted mass or lump of something, which is incredibly broad and can describe almost everything that is matter. Therefore, if all living things are made up of cells and can be categorized as clumps, then all human beings are clumps of cells. Moms are just somewhat larger and more complex clumps of cells than fetuses. So what?

Roche offers both theological and biological critiques of various memes that present arguments for abortion rights and against abortion, reflecting on the impact of these messages.

Pro-Choice Memes:

	1.	Theological Issues: The article challenges a pro-choice meme that misinterprets Christian theology, arguing that the freedom to make choices doesn’t justify immoral actions like abortion. Roche highlights the Christian belief in the sanctity of life, referencing Jeremiah 15, which asserts that God forms and gives purpose to each individual before birth.
	2.	Comedian Morgan Murphy’s Meme: Murphy’s meme implies that abortion, like having children, is a personal decision that may be right for some but not for others. Roche disagrees, arguing that this relativistic view undermines the objective moral stance against abortion. She suggests that while some may not be ready to become parents, abortion shouldn’t be viewed as an acceptable solution.
	3.	Dank Pro-Choice Memes: One of the most disturbing pro-choice memes, as per Roche, treats pregnancy as a “mistake” and abortion as a simple fix. This meme discourages emotional attachment or mourning after abortion, which Roche criticizes as harmful and misleading. She points out that abortion is psychologically damaging to many women and is not a medical necessity, referencing the Dublin Declaration on Maternal Healthcare signed by medical professionals.

Pro-Life Memes:

	1.	Biological Facts: Roche defends pro-life memes that emphasize the biological reality of when life begins. Citing embryology textbooks, she asserts that life starts at fertilization, and any claim to the contrary dismisses scientific facts. She underscores the importance of acknowledging the fetus as a human being from the moment of conception.
	2.	Ad Hominem Attacks by Pro-Choice Advocates: Roche critiques the tendency of pro-choice advocates to use personal attacks instead of engaging with the actual moral or scientific arguments. She argues that identity politics—judging the validity of arguments based on the identity of the person making them—does not change the objective nature of moral debates like abortion.
	3.	Dehumanization and Personhood: One of the key points in pro-life memes is the recognition of fetuses as persons with inherent dignity. Roche argues that denying personhood to the unborn paves the way for dehumanization and exploitation, mirroring historical patterns of oppression. She refutes the idea that fetuses are “just clumps of cells,” asserting that all human beings, regardless of development, are persons.

In conclusion, the article contrasts the pro-choice and pro-life memes by critiquing the underlying philosophies and arguing for the objective morality of life and abortion. Roche’s analysis emphasizes the importance of recognizing the humanity of the unborn and the emotional, psychological, and moral consequences of abortion."
States with strong antiabortion laws have high maternal and infant mortality rates ‚Ä¢ Missouri Independent,"States with strong antiabortion laws have high maternal and infant mortality rates Missouri Independent HOME NEWS Cannabis Criminal Justice Energy Environment Health Care Education Election 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE 1059 States with strong antiabortion laws have high maternal and infant mortality rates Missouri is seventh on the maternal mortality rate list, with 37.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 births John A. Tures July 6, 2022 1059 am Jane NormanStates Newsroom. As someone who considers himself pro-life, I should be celebrating the recent Dobbs case that the Supreme Court used to overturn Roe v. Wade. But Im very concerned today. I believe such a ruling will not only fail to reduce the abortion rate, but could very well lead to an increase in maternal death rates and infant mortality rates. Former President Bill Clinton once said that abortion should be safe, legal and rare. Yet I fear that through such court battles, weve only focused on whether it should be legal or not. So much money has been spent on presidential and congressional races, all about whether or not the court should overturn Roe. Many in the pro-life movement made getting rid of Roe the goal. It was treated like a political victory, like taking an opponents sword after some 18th century battle, instead of supporting a myriad of policies that would actually do something about supporting not just life, but a quality of life worth living. See the connection between mortality rates and antiabortion laws. Take the case of maternal mortality rates. California has the lowest recorded maternal mortality rate 4.0 mother deaths per 100,000 births. Its not an accident, as this death rate plunged by more than 50 since the state passed the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative in 2006. Massachusetts, Nevada, Connecticut and Colorado also round out the lowest five states for recorded maternal mortality rates between 8.4 and 11.5 per 100,000 births, according to World Population Review. All took deliberate steps to help a mother during the process of birth. Louisiana, on the other hand, has a shocking 58.1 maternal deaths per 100,000 births, the highest in America. Not coincidentally, it has the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, according to a CBS analysis of state policies. Then theres Arkansas, with the fourth toughest anti-abortion laws, and the fifth highest maternal mortality rate 37.5 per 100,000 births. Missouri, which is tied with Arkansas for fourth toughest antiabortion laws, is seventh on the maternal mortality rate list from WPR 37.5 per 100k births. Texas, Alabama, South Carolina, and Indiana are also in the top 19 states toughest abortion laws, and the top 10 states for maternal mortality rates each with more than 27 mothers dying per 100,000 births. Have those who pushed for pro-life policies worked just as hard for universal health care, universal child care, or even voted for paid family and medical leave? How many babies will be born into a world that lacks such basic protections that most of the developed world offers? Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Ohio are in the top 10 of states with the highest infant mortality rate according to World Atlas, and are among the states with the top 19 toughest antiabortion laws. I pray that our state leaders will write laws in a way that will not boost mortality rates, just to appease a political ideology instead of the Almighty. Support bipartisan legislation like the bill from Senators Raphael Warnock, D-GA, and Marco Rubio, R-FL, that seek to reduce maternal deaths from childbirth and efforts to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage. Find ways to make pro-life about saving lives, not scoring political points. This commentary was originally published by the Iowa Capital Dispatch, a States Newsroom affiliate.

Tures, the author, argues that the recent Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, which eliminated federal abortion rights, could result in an increase in maternal and infant deaths. Tures expresses concern that anti-abortion policies, which have become a political priority for pro-life advocates, have not been accompanied by efforts to improve healthcare and other support systems for mothers and children.

The article compares maternal mortality rates in states with strict anti-abortion laws to those with more supportive policies. For example, California, which has progressive maternal health policies, reports the lowest maternal mortality rate in the nation, while Louisiana, with strict anti-abortion laws, has the highest. Other states with high maternal mortality rates, such as Arkansas, Missouri, and Texas, also have tough abortion restrictions. Tures emphasizes that states with restrictive abortion laws tend to have higher rates of both maternal and infant mortality, citing statistics showing that Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and other states with strict abortion laws also have some of the highest infant mortality rates.

Tures critiques the pro-life movement, suggesting that it has focused too much on the legal status of abortion and not enough on policies that would genuinely support women and children, such as universal healthcare, child care, and paid family leave. He calls for bipartisan legislation to address maternal mortality and extend postpartum Medicaid coverage, advocating for a broader pro-life agenda that supports both the life of the mother and child.

Ultimately, the article argues that reducing maternal and infant mortality should be a central focus of pro-life efforts, beyond just opposing abortion, and that such policies should prioritize healthcare and family support over political ideology."

The out-of-date laws mean that it's illegal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland even when a woman is pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or when the foetus has no chance of living. Any medical professionals carrying out abortions face a life sentence in prison. Northern Ireland urgently needs to bring its laws in line with human rights, before more women and girls suffer. Law violates human rights Sarah Ewarts first pregnancy was given a fatal foetal diagnosis and she had to travel to England to terminate her pregnancy as it was illegal at home, turning her life into a living nightmare. Together with Sarah and Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission we took her case to the Belfast High Court and today it ruled that laws governing abortion in Northern Ireland are in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This is welcome news, but its shameful that the Courts have had to step in because politicians have repeatedly failed Northern Irelands women. 'I hope that todays ruling means that I, and other women like me, will no longer have to go through the pain I experienced, of having to travel to England, away from the care of the doctors and midwife who knew me, to access the healthcare I needed. 'I, and many women like me have been failed by our politicians. First, they left me with no option but to go to England for medical care. Then, by their refusal to change the law, they left me with no option but to go to the courts on my and other women's behalf.' Sarah Ewart This decision is a hugely significant step towards ensuring the right to access abortion for women and girls in Northern Ireland who have been raped, are victims of incest or whose pregnancies have been given a fatal foetal diagnosis. Northern Irelands laws on abortion date back to the nineteenth century and carry the harshest criminal penalties in Europe. Judge Mr Justice Mark Horner told Belfast High Court that womens human rights were being breached by current laws. 'In the circumstances, given this issue is unlikely to be grasped by the legislature in the foreseeable future, and the entitlement of citizens of Northern Ireland to have their Convention rights protected by the courts, I conclude that the Article Eight rights of women in Northern Ireland who are pregnant with fatal foetal abnormalities or who are pregnant as a result of sexual crime are breached by the impugned provisions.' Judge Mr Justice Mark Horner Northern Irelands abortion laws must be brought into the twenty-first century and into line with international law as a matter of urgency.

Amnesty International UK 2023","In May 2020, the Belfast High Court ruled that Northern Ireland’s abortion laws violated human rights, specifically breaching Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The case, supported by Sarah Ewart and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, highlighted the severe restrictions on abortion in Northern Ireland, where it remains illegal even in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities, rape, or incest. Women in such circumstances were forced to travel to England for abortions, as local laws carry harsh penalties for medical professionals providing abortion services.

The judgment marked a significant step towards ensuring reproductive rights, recognizing that Northern Ireland’s laws, dating back to the 19th century, fail to protect women’s rights and health. Judge Mark Horner criticized the legislature for not addressing this issue and emphasized the necessity of aligning Northern Ireland’s abortion laws with international human rights standards. This decision underscored the urgent need for legal reform, as the current laws are seen as among the most restrictive in Europe, causing unnecessary hardship for women."

Roberts, PhD KevinRobertsTX President Heritage Trustee since 2023 Signs in favor and against the Kansas Constitutional Amendment On Abortion are displayed outside Kansas 10 Highway on August 01, 2022 in Lenexa, Kansas. Kyle Rivas Getty Images Key Takeaways The most important lesson the pro-life movement can take from our defeat in Kansas' constitutional amendment vote is to recognize that it was a defeat. Challenges couldand wouldhave been overcome had the GOP actually showed up for the fight. Even after Dobbs, the unborn still cannot defend themselves. It is conservatives' privilege to do so, but the Kansas results show that it is also a duty. Copied The most important lesson the pro-life movement can take from our defeat in Kansas' constitutional amendment vote is to recognize that it was a defeat. No good can come from pretending that a double-digit blowout, in a high-turnout election in a red state, is something other than a serious setback. But neither is it any reason for conservatives to panic. Nothing that happened in Kansas warrants the pro-abortion media's giddy overreaction. The Left's insistence that the end of Roe v. Wade will trigger a nationwide voter backlash remains so much elite-bubble wishful thinking. Lest we forget, the pro-life movement has been defined by enduring and overcoming disappointments Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, John Roberts, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. By all rights, the constitutional dumpster fire that is Roe should have been put out decades ago. That it finally was this year is a testament to pro-lifers' ability to react, adapt, and win. For conservatives, success is always a process of trial and error. And in the Kansas fight, Republican leaders did indeed make an inexcusable error they sat it out. Biden Executive Order on Abortion Access Is Misleading and Full of Misinformation The Media-Industrial complex was, as always, totally committed to abortion maximalism in the Kansas campaign. They poured millions of dollars into slickly produced, misleading ads against the ""Value Them Both"" amendment. They smeared it as cruel and radical, saying that it would mandate a ban on all abortions, endanger women's lives, and provide no exceptions for cases like rape or incest. The language of the amendment certainly didn't help, either. The wording was so confusing that voters on both sides of the question couldn't be sure whether a ""yes"" vote was the pro-choice or pro-life position. But both of those challenges couldand wouldhave been overcome had the GOP actually showed up for the fight. The end of Roe was not the end of abortion. It was the beginning, finally, of a real abortion debate in this country. Pro-abortion politicians are eager for it. Too many pro-life ones, though, prefer to duck it. They think they're playing it safe, but all that does is let pro-abortion extremists frame the debate. It takes a certain kind of partisan malpractice to cede the political high ground to angry fanatics who firebomb churches and threaten opponents, demanding public funding for partial-birth and sex-selective abortions. But here we are. The good news for pro-life conservatives is that, Kansas notwithstanding, we are still in a still better place than at any time since 1973. The cause of life still enjoys unprecedented momentum. Thirteen states are already enforcing pro-life laws triggered by the Dobbs decision. Indiana just passed legislation protecting the unborn. Pro-life referenda will be on ballots in several states in November. And the Kansas campaign, toodespite the sting of defeatgives pro-lifers valuable guidance about how to reclaim the political initiative between now and the midterms. Indeed, that guidance is already clear if pro-lifers want to pass pro-life laws, they have to make pro-life arguments. New York Times Essay Likening Miscarriage to Abortion is Despicable and Denigrates Women Like Me For all the Left's manipulation, the fact is that the pro-abortion position is closer to the infanticidal barbarism of China's and North Korea's dictatorships than it is to Americans' stated preferences. A January poll found 71 percent of Americans support placing some restrictions on abortion pro-abortion politicians, by and large, want none. Most Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortionspro-abortion politicians demand it. More than 70 percent of Americans support a ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That's the letter of the Mississippi law at issue in Dobbs! The elite narrative about a monolithically pro-abortion America is a lie. But if pro-lifersespecially high-profile ones in Washingtonsurrender the field, that lie will win. Even after Dobbs, the unborn still cannot defend themselves. It is conservatives' privilege to do so, but the Kansas results show that it is also a duty. In the fight for life, failure is not an optionand silence is not a strategy.

Roberts discusses the pro-life movement’s defeat in Kansas, emphasizing the lessons that can be learned from this loss. Despite the setback in Kansas, where voters rejected a constitutional amendment to restrict abortion, Roberts urges pro-life conservatives to recognize the defeat but not to panic. He asserts that this loss does not signal a nationwide pro-abortion shift and stresses that the pro-life cause is still strong, with significant progress made after the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

Roberts critiques the Republican Party’s failure to actively engage in the Kansas campaign, which he believes contributed to the loss. The pro-abortion media launched a highly funded, misleading campaign against the amendment, distorting its provisions and generating confusion. Roberts suggests that the GOP’s passive approach allowed the pro-abortion side to dominate the narrative.

Despite this, Roberts highlights the broader context of the pro-life movement’s success, noting that thirteen states are enforcing pro-life laws, with more referenda and legislation expected. He emphasizes that pro-life advocates must actively make their case and engage in the abortion debate to reclaim the political initiative.

Roberts concludes by challenging the notion that America is a monolithically pro-abortion nation, pointing to polling data showing that most Americans support abortion restrictions. He argues that the pro-life movement must continue to fight for the unborn and not remain silent or passive, warning that failure to act will allow the pro-abortion narrative to prevail."

Today, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression called on the UNC Chapel Hill student government to rescind the order and commit to distributing funds in a viewpoint-neutral manner. This is blatant viewpoint discrimination and a clear violation of fundamental First Amendment rights, said FIRE attorney Zach Greenberg, who wrote todays letter to the university. A student government should represent the entire student body, not abuse its power by seeking to censor classmates with opposing views. On July 6, the UNC Chapel Hill Student Government executive branch issued an order prohibiting contracts or funding to any individual, business, or organization which actively advocates to further limit by law access to reproductive healthcare. It is unclear exactly what types of funding requests are subject to the executive branchs unconstitutional and discriminatory prohibition. The student senate also handles funding requests and, to date, has not taken the same viewpoint discriminatory stance. UNC Chapel Hills chapter of Students for Life, one of the countrys largest pro-life advocacy organizations, responded with a statement expressing dismay and urging Student Body President Taliajah Vann to rescind the order and live up to her campaign promise that she would help every member of the student body. As a public institution, UNC Chapel Hill is bound by the First Amendment, which precludes the school from discriminating against student groups based on viewpoint. The student government is therefore constitutionally required to distribute funds in a viewpoint-neutral manner. Additionally, UNC Chapel Hill makes strong commitments to free speech, earning FIREs highest, green light rating. FIREs letter to Vann asks her administration to immediately rescind the unconstitutional order and commit to viewpoint neutrality. UNC Chapel Hills student government cannot declare itself the arbiter of which opinions are acceptable, said Greenberg. We call on these student leaders to uphold their constituents free speech rights by doling out funds in a viewpoint-neutral manner.

The order has drawn criticism from organizations such as the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), which has called for the student government to rescind the order and ensure that funds are distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner.

FIRE argues that the order violates the First Amendment’s protections for free speech and that UNC, as a public institution, must refrain from discriminating against student groups based on their viewpoints. The order, issued by Student Body President Taliajah Vann, prohibits funding from the executive branch to pro-life groups but does not affect the student senate’s funding decisions, which have not adopted a similar stance. UNC’s chapter of Students for Life expressed concern, urging Vann to reconsider and align her actions with her campaign promise to serve all students.

FIRE, which is committed to defending individual rights on campus, particularly free speech, has emphasized that student governments should not act as arbiters of acceptable opinions. The organization has demanded that the UNC student government retract the order and uphold the constitutional rights of all students, ensuring that funding is allocated fairly and without bias."

Surrounded by DFL legislators, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, center, holds up a bill he signed that adds a ""fundamental right"" to abortion access into state law on Jan. 31, 2023, in St. Paul, Minn. Glen StubbeStar TribuneAP CNN Minnesotas Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill into law Tuesday that enshrines the fundamental right to access abortion in the state. Abortion is already legal in Minnesota, but in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the Protect Reproductive Options Act goes a step further by outlining that every person has the fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about their own reproductive health as well as the right to refuse reproductive health care. This is very simple, very right to the point, Walz said Tuesday on CNN Tonight. We trust women in Minnesota, and thats not what came out of the Supreme Courts decision, so I think its critically important that we build a fire wall. With the passage of the bill, Minnesota is now the first state to codify abortion via legislative action since Roe v. Wade was reversed, the office of the bills lead author in Minnesotas state Senate, told CNN. Last November, Minnesotans spoke loud and clear They want their reproductive rights protected not stripped away, Walz said in a news release. Today, we are delivering on our promise to put up a firewall against efforts to reverse reproductive freedom. No matter who sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court, this legislation will ensure Minnesotans have access to reproductive health care for generations to come. Here in Minnesota, your access to reproductive health care and your freedom to make your own health care decisions are preserved and protected. The bill states that local government cannot restrict a persons ability to exercise the fundamental right to reproductive freedom. It also clarifies that this right extends to accessing contraception, sterilization, family planning, fertility services and counseling regarding reproductive health care. The Pro Act also goes beyond just granting those rights to abortion, it really says all reproductive healthcare decisions arent our business, including access to contraception, including access to really anything that is related to personal and private decisions about your reproductive life, Megan Peterson, the executive director of pro-abortion rights campaign UnRestrict Minnesota, told CNN following Walzs signing of the bill. In a letter to Walz ahead of the signing, Republican legislature leaders argued that the bill went too far and urged the governor to veto what they called an extreme law. As the PRO Act was being rushed through the legislature, Republicans offered reasonable amendments with guardrails to protect women and children, state Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson and House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth wrote, Sadly, each of these amendments were struck down by a Democrat majority. In 1995, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in Doe v. Gomez that abortion was a fundamental right protected under the states constitution. The Protect Reproductive Options Act ensures that even in the event of a new state Supreme Court reversing the ruling, the right to abortion will be protected under state law. By passing this law, Minnesotans will have a second layer of protection for their existing reproductive rights. A future Minnesota Supreme Court could overturn Doe v. Gomez, but with the PRO Act now in State law, Minnesotans will still have a right to Reproductive healthcare, Luke Bishop, a spokesperson for Democratic State Sen. Jennifer McEwen, the bills author in the Senate, told CNN over email. Following the governors signature of the bill, the White House applauded Minnesotas efforts, pointing to the popular support for womens rights to make their own health care decisions. Americans overwhelmingly support a womans right to make her own health care decisions, as so clearly demonstrated last fall when voters turned out to defend access to abortion including for ballot initiatives in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. While Congressional Republicans continue their support for extreme policies including a national abortion ban, the President and Vice President are calling on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law, she wrote. Until then, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue its work to protect access to abortion and support state leaders in defending womens reproductive rights.

CNN Sans 2016 Cable News Network.","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed the Protect Reproductive Options Act (PRO Act) into law on January 31, 2023, securing the fundamental right to abortion and reproductive health care in the state. This law strengthens abortion access, which was already legal in Minnesota, by explicitly recognizing the right to make autonomous decisions about reproductive health. It ensures that individuals can access not only abortion but also contraception, sterilization, fertility services, and reproductive health counseling. The law also protects against local government restrictions on these rights.

This move follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and makes Minnesota the first state to codify abortion rights through legislative action after that ruling. Governor Walz emphasized that this law serves as a safeguard against efforts to reverse reproductive freedoms and will provide long-term protection for Minnesotans’ health care rights, regardless of changes in the state Supreme Court.

Republican leaders criticized the bill, arguing that it was extreme and failed to include protections for women and children. They proposed amendments, which were rejected by the Democrat-majority legislature. However, proponents of the bill, like Megan Peterson of UnRestrict Minnesota, praised its broad scope, ensuring privacy and freedom over personal reproductive decisions.

The law also builds on a 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling (Doe v. Gomez), which already protected abortion as a fundamental right. The PRO Act offers an additional layer of security in case future changes in the state Supreme Court might challenge the previous ruling. The White House supported the law, highlighting the strong public backing for abortion rights and calling for a national restoration of Roe v. Wade protections."

Those are people living, breathing humans who had families and jobs and hopes and dreams. Theyre gone, and hardly a word has been uttered on their behalf. Its disappointing, but not surprising, to see the pro-life conservatives in the Legislature and their allied interest groups using the pandemic as an opportunity to push their dangerous anti-health care, anti-science agenda. While hospitals were so overrun with dying patients that refrigerated trucks idled out front to accommodate the rapidly accumulating bodies of COVID-19 victims, legislative leaders issued press releases demanding that golf courses be opened. After a member of the state House of Representatives, Isaac Robinson, died from suspected COVID-19, those leaders insisted it was safe to meet in large groups, calling more than 150 lawmakers and staff back to Lansing to pass frivolous bills attacking Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Court says Arizona company doesnt have to make invitations for same-sex weddings Hows that for pro-life? Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups were livid that Planned Parenthood of Michigan health centers remained open, allowing people who needed basic reproductive health care, including abortions safe, legal medical procedures to access them. They issued press releases demanding we shut down and deny people essential medical care, including the birth control, STI testing and treatment, and other crucial health services. Lets be clear Reproductive health care is essential. There is no more critical time for the care we provide than during a public health crisis. For many patients, our health centers are their only source for health care the unfortunate reality is the pandemic has made existing barriers to care worse for many of the communities Planned Parenthood serves. Thats why weve taken every possible action to keep as many of our health centers open as possible while protecting the safety of our patients and employees alike. Its why weve rapidly begun offering telehealth services, including birth control, UTI treatment, and emergency contraception so our patients can access the urgent care they need without leaving home. Planned Parenthood offers telehealth services for birth control, UTIs Yet, we all know that no matter what the totality of our work is, for the pro-life movement, its always about abortion. Id argue that to be truly pro-life means to give everyone access to the tools they need to live healthy, happy lives equal pay for equal work, paid sick time off, safe workplaces, high quality health care, basic civil rights. The services and care we provide are essential to helping Michiganders live healthy, happy lives of their choosing. There is an undeniable public and personal health benefit to diagnosing and treating an STI before it causes cervical cancer. I look around at anti-abortion groups and the conservatives in the Legislature, and I struggle to see how theyre living out their self-professed commitment to protecting the sanctity of life in the midst of this unprecedented health emergency. Its plain to see what they didnt do a single thing to make the lives of Michiganders easier as we worked to stop the virus tearing through our most vulnerable communities. I couldnt be prouder of what Planned Parenthood of Michigan has been doing to protect the lives of the people in the communities we serve. Weve ensured that essential health care is accessible and affordable especially now with record numbers of unemployed people having lost their health care. And weve made certain that everyone who comes to our health centers and the dedicated people who work there are safe, following the governors social distancing, screening and mask requirements diligently. Planned Parenthood president pans Detroit debates for ignoring reproductive rights Weve joined dozens of partners in coalition to connect communities with resources to weather job loss, illness and even the death of their loved ones. Together with our allies, weve provided grassroots community care and advocated for policies that prioritize the health and well-being of struggling Michiganders. Planned Parenthood of Michigan has been a key part of the states public health infrastructure for 100 years, and its clear that were working to keep that social safety net strong during this crisis. I invite the entire pro-life community, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey R-Clarklake and House Speaker Lee Chatfield R-Levering to join us in helping the people of Michigan get the care and support they need to emerge from this pandemic ready to resume their lives.

She points out that while nearly 5,600 Michiganders died from the virus, pro-life conservatives in the Michigan Legislature focused on issues like reopening golf courses instead of addressing the public health crisis. Meanwhile, these same groups criticized Planned Parenthood for continuing to provide essential reproductive health care, including safe, legal abortions and critical services like STI testing, birth control, and emergency contraception, during the pandemic.

Carpentier argues that true pro-life values should encompass more than opposition to abortion; they should include ensuring that all people have access to healthcare, equal pay, paid sick leave, and basic civil rights. She highlights that Planned Parenthood has continued to provide vital services during the crisis, including telehealth for birth control and UTI treatment, while following strict safety protocols.

She challenges pro-life lawmakers, specifically Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, to demonstrate their commitment to the sanctity of life by supporting policies that help Michiganders navigate the pandemic and its economic fallout. Carpentier emphasizes that Planned Parenthood has been an essential part of Michigan’s public health infrastructure for over 100 years, and it remains committed to supporting communities in need during this crisis."

Wade fallsAkron Zoo worker recovering from injuries after being bitten by Komodo dragonNews Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals POLITICSNew Ohio bill would ban abortion if Supreme Court empowers states to decide Doug LivingstonAkron Beacon JournalWith her fingers crossed that Roe v. Wade falls, a Hudson lawmaker has introduced a bill in the Ohio Senate that would automatically ban all abortions, except to prevent the death or serious injury of pregnant women in limited cases.Sen. Kristina Roegner R-Hudson joined Sandra O'Brien R-Ashtabula this week to introduce Senate Bill 123. Known across the nation as a trigger law, the legislation would automatically make Ohio a ""right to life"" state should the landmark Roe case protecting a woman's right to abortion be overturned by the more conservative Supreme Court or the states ratify an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would prohibit abortion.I believe that when the U.S. Supreme Court considers a challenge to Roe, they will realize that the original decision from 1973 was seriously flawed, and return the authority regarding abortion to the states,"" Roegner said in a press release on her new bill, dubbed the Human Life Protection Act. ""This is why Ohio should be proactive in passing this legislation declaring that we respect the sanctity of life and will defend the most vulnerable among us the unborn.""Roegner told a Beacon Journal reporter in early March that her faith strongly influences her position on matters of ending a life. Last General Assembly, she co-sponsored a bill to end the death penalty. She said she's on-board with that effort again this year.Roegner's bill would ban all abortions, including those performed before a heartbeat is detected. A narrow exception would be made ""to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."" In order for a physician to cite this exception and avoid homicide charges, the doctor mustPrep for the polls See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter GuideDeclare in writing, and get a second physician with no professional connection to do the same, that the abortion was necessary to prevent death or serious harm.Perform the abortion in a way that ""provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive"" in a hospital or facility with neonatal services for premature infants.And ""take all reasonable steps necessary to preserve the life and health of the unborn child immediately upon the child's complete expulsion or extraction from the pregnant woman.""Abortion rights groups criticize new billThe anti-abortion trigger law drew swift criticism from defenders of a woman's right to access the medical procedure.""Ohioans deserve better. Ohioans deserve lawmakers who are focused on making their lives better, not restricting their access to care,"" Lauren Blauvelt-Copelin, vice president of Government Affairs and Public Advocacy of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, said in a statement to the press.""Trigger bans like these are not about protecting people they are about taking away access and spreading misinformation,"" said Blauvelt-Copelin. ""We cannot and will not accept a world where safe, legal reproductive health care depends on where you live.The right to decide whether or when to have a child is a fundamental human right, said NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director Kellie Copeland. Ohioans need and deserve access to safe and affordable abortion care in their local communities. They dont need anti-abortion politicians interfering with their reproductive health care decisions. Abortion is safe and legal in Ohio NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio and our partners are working every day to keep it that way.""Potential cases to overturn Roe v. WadeIn 2019, the Ohio General Assembly passed and Gov. Mike DeWine signed a so-called heartbeat bill, which bans abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The new law makes an exception in cases when the mothers life is at risk, but not when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.

Wade or if an amendment is passed to prohibit abortion. The bill, introduced by Republican Senators Kristina Roegner and Sandra O’Brien, is designed to automatically make Ohio a “right to life” state. It would only allow abortion to save the life of the mother or prevent serious injury, and even then, strict conditions must be met, such as obtaining a second opinion from another doctor and ensuring the best chance for the fetus’s survival.

The bill has faced strong criticism from abortion rights groups, such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, who argue that it would limit access to safe reproductive healthcare and infringe on individual rights. The bill is seen as a proactive measure in anticipation of potential changes to Roe v. Wade, especially with two cases pending before the Supreme Court that could lead to significant shifts in abortion law.

Ohio previously passed a “heartbeat bill” in 2019, banning abortion after six weeks, which is currently on hold due to legal challenges. If Senate Bill 123 is enacted, it would place Ohio among 16 states with laws that would automatically ban abortion should Roe v. Wade be overturned. Public opinion, according to Pew Research, shows that a majority of Americans (61%) support abortion rights in most cases."

I didnt expect this All Lives Matter rally to be such a wonderful reunion! confided Ned Wallace, simultaneously waving the American flag, the Confederate flag, and a Punisher logo flag. My jaw just about hit the floor when I saw all my buddies from those pro-death penalty rallies we had last year after that kid got caught with a dimebag of weed. Hell, I hope I see these same folks next weekend weve got a pro-life march on Saturday, and then an NRA picnic on Sunday. The All Lives Matter rally was held in response to a much larger Black Lives Matter event occurring simultaneously on the other side of town. I believe that all lives matter which means it really fucking pisses me off when people say that black lives matter, explained rally attendee Waylon Jarrett. Anyway, its great to see everyone back after last years candlelight vigil to reinstate death-by-firing-squads. Its a gorgeous day, and weve got tons of people out here supporting America because they want whats best for our country. Although we did have to kick out a few pussies for wearing masks. According to experts, support of the death penalty is common amongst the All Lives Matter movement. In psychology, we call it cognitive dissonance when a person holds seemingly incompatible beliefs, such as saying that all lives matter, while also endorsing state-sanctioned execution, noted renowned psychologist Dr. Anna St. Claire. Or pro-life advocates who have no issue with cops needlessly murdering civilians, or Trump voters who claim they arent racist scum. You get the idea. At press time, several All Lives Matter protestors gathered to protect a confederate statue, which they later discovered was actually a local KFCs Colonel Sanders promotional display.

This revelation underscores a connection between disparate and often contradictory movements. One attendee, Ned Wallace, expresses excitement about reuniting with people from past rallies, while also listing other upcoming events, including a pro-life march and an NRA picnic.

The rally itself is presented as a counter-response to a larger Black Lives Matter protest, with rally-goers expressing anger at the concept of Black Lives Matter while claiming to support all lives. Some protestors also recount kicking people out for wearing masks, showing a disregard for safety measures.

Experts are quoted highlighting the cognitive dissonance inherent in the All Lives Matter stance—supporting both the death penalty and claiming to value all lives, as well as the contradictory nature of being pro-life but supporting police violence. In a humorous twist, protestors later gather around a Confederate statue, only to realize it is just a promotional display for a local KFC.

The article satirizes the disjointed and often contradictory ideologies that can exist within certain political movements, pointing out the lack of logical consistency in many of the protestors’ beliefs."

This follows a ruling by the country’s constitutional court in October 2020, which declared that abortions for congenital defects violated the constitution. The decision has led to widespread protests across Poland, with thousands gathering in Warsaw and other cities to express their opposition, despite pandemic-related restrictions. Protesters included members of the “Women’s Strike” group and supporters of LGBT rights, who marched to the ruling party’s headquarters.

Prior to this ruling, a significant proportion of legal abortions in Poland were due to congenital defects, with 98 out of 1,000 abortions in 2019 performed for this reason. Though around 2,000 legal abortions were conducted annually, many women resorted to illegal procedures or traveled abroad for the procedure. Following the court’s decision, the government published the ruling, effectively making the ban law.

The law has sparked criticism, particularly from opposition parties like the Civic Platform, which called it a “provocation” and accused the government of using it to deflect attention from its handling of the pandemic. In response, members of the ruling Law and Justice party suggested that further reforms, including new legislation addressing lethal fetal defects, are being considered. The government’s ties with the Catholic Church, which supports the abortion restrictions, have also fueled tensions in the debate."
Leader Rodgers: This Extreme Agenda for More Abortion Promotes Fear and Dehumanization,"Leader Rodgers This Extreme Agenda for More Abortion Promotes Fear and DehumanizationSkip to main contentSubscribeMembersSubcommitteesCalendarNews MediaAboutMembersSubcommitteesCalendarNews MediaAboutNewsPress ReleaseShare onLeader Rodgers This Extreme Agenda for More Abortion Promotes Fear and DehumanizationJul 15, 2022Press ReleaseLives Worth LivingOn the House FloorWe Should be Coming Together Around Human Rights of the UnbornWashington, D.C. Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Leader Cathy McMorris Rodgers R-WA led debate against Democrats Ensuring Access to Abortion Act today.DEMOCRATS PUSHING A FALSE CHOICEI rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act.Just like the Democrats Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act, this bill is part of an extreme agenda to nationalize abortion for all nine months of pregnancy.Abortion is a false choice between taking care of a woman and taking care of a baby.What a woman needs is support. Every life is meaningful, and our actions significant.DEMOCRATIC FEARMONGERING76 percent of women seeking an abortion say they would choose life if their circumstances were different.Instead of promoting ways to support women and children with better health care, education, and financial stability and changing their circumstances, Democrats, including President Biden, are spreading fear, anxiety, and misinformation.This is a blatant attempt to spread fear and present abortion at any stage of pregnancy as a womans only option.So, I want to be very clear. It is already unconstitutional to prevent a woman from traveling between states.The pro-life movement does not support and has always rejected criminalizing and punishing women, period.State laws currently in effect have exceptions to save the life of the mother.Pro-life laws do not prevent women from getting care they need in cases of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.THIS BILL PROTECTS PREDATORSRegarding this legislation, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, I have many questions and concerns.Its vague languagedesigned to promote more abortionsundermines parent consent for minors, opens loopholes for abuse, and eliminates medical supervision for chemical abortions.This bill does nothing to explicitly prevent an unrelated adult or a sexual abuser from taking a minor out-of-state for an abortion, without parent consent.It would prevent health care professionals, social workers, and schools in every state from reporting instances of child abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect because that could be seen as delaying or hindering access to abortion.It also undermines parental rights.Parents can be targeted by the federal government and sued for wanting to help their child just by asking them to delay traveling to get an abortion.If their child is 16 for example, the parents lose power to protect their teenager from being coerced by an older man to get an abortion.HARMING THE HEALTH OF WOMENThe Ensuring Access to Abortion Act undermines the health and safety of women.By pre-empting state laws regulating the practice of medicine, it overrides the majority of states that have determined it is safest for doctors to prescribe pills for chemical abortions.This puts women and minors in danger if they experience complications.Finally, these same provisions give sexual abusers and human traffickers more direct access to chemical abortions in all 50 states.It ensures that doctors in states like California, where there is no parent consent, can effectively become pill mills, by prescribing and mailing abortion drugs to children and minors and end lives all over the country.This is extreme.DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTSAgain, I ask my colleagues to abandon this agenda for unlimited abortions with no restrictions.It only promotes more fear, pain, and dehumanization of the most vulnerable, the helpless among us.Instead, lets come together around the human rights of every person in this countryborn and unborn.Lets celebrate the dignity, value, and potential of every person.This is our chance to lead a new era of hope and healing in our country. For every personfor moms and their babies at every stage of life.Every life is worth living.I urge a no vote on this bill and reserve the balance of my time.Share onEnergy Commerce CommitteeOffice2125 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20515Main 202 225-3641Press 202 226-4972 Minority WebsitePrivacyAccessibility","In her speech on July 15, 2022, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the Republican Leader of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, strongly opposed the Democrats’ “Ensuring Access to Abortion Act” (H.R. 8297). She characterized the bill as part of a broader, extreme agenda to allow abortion for all nine months of pregnancy, which she argued creates a false dichotomy between supporting women and protecting babies. She stated that the real solution lies in providing better support systems for women, such as healthcare, education, and financial stability, rather than promoting abortion.

Rodgers criticized Democrats for spreading fear and misinformation about abortion, claiming that 76% of women seeking abortion would choose life under different circumstances. She also rejected the notion that pro-life policies criminalize or punish women, emphasizing that current laws allow for exceptions to save the life of the mother and do not interfere with medical care for miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies.

A major concern for Rodgers regarding the bill was its potential to harm women and children. She argued that it could undermine parental consent, particularly for minors, allowing predators to facilitate out-of-state abortions without parental knowledge. The bill’s vague language could also hinder the reporting of child abuse and neglect, as healthcare professionals could be discouraged from reporting such cases to avoid delaying abortion access. Additionally, she warned that the bill would bypass state regulations, potentially putting women at risk by allowing unsupervised chemical abortions, especially for minors, and giving easier access to predators and human traffickers.

Rodgers called for abandoning the “unlimited abortion agenda” in favor of protecting human rights for both the born and the unborn, urging a vote against the bill. She advocated for a more hopeful, supportive approach that celebrates the dignity of every life."
"For the First Time Ever, U.S. States Enacted More Than 100 Abortion Restrictions in a Single Year","For the First Time Ever, U.S. States Enacted More Than 100 Abortion Restrictions in a Single Year Year January 1, 2021 Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher Institute States have enacted 106 abortion restrictions so far in 2021, a year that has been marked by unprecedented threats to U.S. abortion rights and access. Not only is 106 the highest number of restrictions passed since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, but also this year is the first time that Guttmachers count of enacted restrictions has hit triple digits. Earlier this year, the number of restrictions had already surpassed the previous record of 89 restrictions set in 2011. In total, 19 states have enacted 106 restrictions, including 12 abortion bans. While Texas is dominating national news this year, there are five other states that passed higher numbers of anti-abortion provisions. The state with the most new restrictions is Arkansas 20, followed by Oklahoma 16, then Indiana, Montana and South Dakota nine each. Arkansass 20 restrictions enacted in 2021 ties with Louisianas 1978 record for the most restrictions in a single year. Leading up to 2021, there have been restrictions passed for decades, with each one making it harder to access and provide abortion services, and also building momentum for even more burdensome restrictions and bans. The torrent of new restrictions this year includes the Texas six-week abortion ban that took effect on September 1, making it the only ban on abortion before 20 weeks to go into effect since 1973. The law S.B. 8 has already caused significant harm in Texas and has left abortion patients and providers confronting very limited access within Texas, as well as capacity, logistical and financial issues in connecting patients to timely and affordable care outside of the state. On September 17, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott R signed legislation restricting access to medication abortion, which is set to take effect on December 2, potentially limiting access to the method used for most abortions before six weeks. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on December 1 on Mississippis blatantly unconstitutional 15-week abortion ban, a case that the Courts conservative anti-abortion majority could use to weaken or outright overturn Roe. Abortion restrictions and bans are a direct violation of basic human rights and reproductive freedom. None of the 106 abortion restrictions enacted in 2021 are medically necessary. Their only purpose is to impose a socially conservative worldview and exert control over how people make decisions about their pregnancies. Abortion restrictions have serious physical and mental health consequences, in addition to negative financial and societal impacts. Furthermore, abortion restrictions exacerbate logistical and financial obstacles for people who are already struggling to get by or who have reduced access to timely, affordable, high-quality health caresuch as people with low incomes, people of color, young people, LGBTQ individuals and people in many rural communities. Source URL","In 2021, U.S. states enacted a record 106 abortion restrictions, marking the first time this number has surpassed triple digits. This year broke the previous record of 89 restrictions set in 2011 and is the highest number since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. A total of 19 states introduced these measures, including 12 outright abortion bans. Arkansas led the way with 20 new restrictions, followed by Oklahoma with 16. Other states like Indiana, Montana, and South Dakota each enacted 9.

Among the most notable changes was the Texas law (S.B. 8) that banned abortions after six weeks, the earliest such ban to go into effect since 1973. This law has significantly limited abortion access in Texas, leading to logistical and financial challenges for individuals seeking care outside the state. Texas also introduced restrictions on medication abortions, set to take effect in December 2021. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in December about Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, a case that could further undermine Roe v. Wade, especially given the Court’s conservative majority.

The 106 abortion restrictions passed in 2021 are seen as a violation of reproductive rights, with no medical justification, but rather a reflection of a socially conservative agenda. These measures negatively impact individuals’ physical and mental health, particularly for marginalized groups such as people with low incomes, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and those in rural areas, creating further barriers to accessing healthcare."

Established in 2016, we work to bring you local news that is unbiased and honest. 0 Mar 19 Mar 19 Meet the Pro-Life Conservative Veteran Challenging Lubbock Mayor Pope Thomas Warren Regional News, Election Coverage Stephen SandersPhoto by Campaign Amarillo and Lubbock have a unique relationship to one another, both seen as population hubs in the West Texas area. With the relationship between the two cities has come political maneuvering between the elected officials from both. Amarillo Mayor Ginger Nelson and Lubbock Mayor Dan Pope have both worked hand-in-hand on a number of initiatives, including a trip by both of the Mayors, alongside El Paso Mayor Dee Margo in 2017, in which the three officials lobbied Governor Greg Abbott against proposed property tax reform legislation. With big spending initiatives and ballooning tax burdens in both communities, and across Texas, both Nelson and Pope have come under criticism for the same types of spending habits. While Amarillo voters still have a year to wait before the next municipal election, one Lubbock resident is bringing the choice for mayor to voters in that citys upcoming municipal election.Lubbock musician Stephen Sanders is challenging Pope in the citys upcoming May 2 election for the Hub Citys top elected spot. Sanders is a self-described pro-life conservative who is currently seeking an advertising degree from Texas Tech University with plans to soon open an advertising firm to serve small businesses. After serving in the U.S. military, Sanders returned to Lubbock and became actively involved in his church, where he eventually met his wife. Sanders is known as a community servant in Lubbock, feeding the homeless and working as a team builder. In 2018, Sanders ran as a write-in candidate for mayor after missing the filing deadline. Sanders ran a hard fought campaign and ended up with about 4 percent of the vote, even though he was not listed on the ballot as a candidate. Now, he is running for mayor as a full fledged candidate who pledges to bring all communities together in Lubbock.I realized in the midst of the last campaign that I have a purpose to bring people together from all races, all nationalities, all backgrounds, Sanders said. My one dream is to see our city not look at color, not look at race, not look at how much money you have. I also want to see East Lubbock and North Lubbock to not be forgotten about.Sanders takes issue with Mayor Popes record on issues such as taxes and spending. In an interview with the Pioneer, Sanders said he feels a more conservative approach should be taken to these issues and mentioned he feels Pope has been too willing to support tax increases while collecting accolades for his record.Right now Dan Pope says he's a conservative mayor but we are just spending money like crazy, Sanders said. We have to reel it in, calm down, and get done with the projects we have, and give the citizens a chance to breathe. This is a retirement city and there are people who come here to retire. If you look at the tax increases since Mr. Pope's been in office, it just goes up and up and up. Let's reel it in and focus on the issues that matter.Instead of the current way of conducting business in Lubbock, Sanders says he will take a new and independent attitude to work for taxpayers.I am for the people. Nobody can buy me or lure me in. I want to do what's best for the people and give them a break, Sanders said.In a question posed for the interview, Sanders also noted Popes trip to Austin with Nelson and Margo in 2017, saying he would be against what they did, adding that he would rather look to cut spending than to seek additional tax increases. Sanders went on to say he would be more proactive in being a voice for the people, if elected.The mayor is an extension of the people, Sanders said. PopePhoto by KFYO On the issue of the relationship between Amarillo and Lubbock, Sanders says he believes he will be a unifying voice for all communities across West Texas.Once I'm in office, some things are going to change, Sanders said. Things are going to be open. I think it will really light West Texas up in a positive way. We're going to bring life back and love back. People are going to win. They are going to win because the people are the city.Sanders and Pope will face off in the mayoral election scheduled for May 2. Some city council races will also be on the ballot.For more information about Sanders, visit Thomas Warren Regional News, Election Coverage March 19 2020 Facebook0 Twitter 0 Likes Leave a comment Mar 19 Sod Poodles to Close Front Office, Team Store Mar 18 Amarillo Weather March 18-20 Related Posts Feb 19 Feb 19 Texas Tech Student to Challenge Lubbock Mayor Pope Oct 8 Oct 8 Sanders, Pope Squaring Off in Important Race for Lubbock and West Texas Oct 12 Oct 12 Candidate Comparison Lubbock Mayor It's free!

Powered by Squarespace","Stephen Sanders, a Lubbock musician, conservative veteran, and community activist, is challenging Lubbock Mayor Dan Pope in the upcoming May 2 mayoral election. Sanders, who is currently pursuing an advertising degree at Texas Tech University and plans to open a small-business advertising firm, has a strong pro-life stance and a background in serving his community, including feeding the homeless and fostering team-building initiatives.

Sanders previously ran as a write-in candidate in 2018 and secured around 4% of the vote. This time, he is running as a formal candidate with a focus on reducing taxes and spending, which he believes have been mismanaged under Pope’s leadership. He criticizes Pope for supporting tax increases and overspending, especially in a city with a large retiree population. Sanders vows to be more conservative and prioritize the needs of the people by reining in spending and completing ongoing projects before starting new ones.

In his campaign, Sanders emphasizes unity and inclusivity, aiming to bring together people from diverse backgrounds and ensure that areas like East and North Lubbock are not overlooked. He is also critical of the 2017 trip Pope took with Amarillo Mayor Ginger Nelson and El Paso Mayor Dee Margo to lobby against property tax reforms, stating that he would prioritize cutting spending instead of increasing taxes.

Sanders views the mayor as an extension of the people and promises to be a proactive and independent voice for the citizens of Lubbock and West Texas. He believes his leadership will foster a positive, unified future for the region, bringing “life and love back” to the community. The election is set to take place on May 2, with Sanders and Pope vying for the mayor’s seat, alongside several city council races."

AP PhotoJeffrey Collins By Jeffrey Collins and JAMES POLLARD Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print COLUMBIA, S.C. AP The South Carolina House on Tuesday approved a bill that outlaws abortion except in the cases of pregnancies caused by rape or incest.The chamber initially rejected the bill without the exceptions by eight votes. But once Republicans saw the outcome, they quickly went through a number of complex procedures and votes to bring the bill back from the brink of failure.The exceptions were added by enough lawmakers shouting aye and the bill passed by a vote of 67-38.The bill has one more routine vote before it goes to the Senate, where stricter bans on abortions have seen tougher fights.The bill allows abortions up to 12 weeks after conception if a women tells a doctor she was raped. The doctor has to tell the woman he is going to report the rape to the county sheriff and has 24 hours after the procedure to give deputies the womans name and contact information. It also allows abortions to save a mothers life. Some of the Houses most conservative lawmakers said Monday they would not support a bill with the rape and incest exceptions, but when it came to a final vote, they changed their minds. But heres the thing at the end of the day we passed a good pro-life bill in South Carolina, said Republican Rep. John McCravy, who shepherded the bill through the chamber.The dizzying parliamentary maneuvers happened after Democrats joined with those conservatives to try to keep the bill as restrictive as possible. Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics as they also voted down an amendment supporters said would allow abortions for women carrying fetuses with medical problems leaving them unlikely to be born alive.The ladies of South Carolina, they are gambling with your body, Republican Rep Micah Caskey said.Democrats said they didnt want to debate abortion again after the General Assembly agreed to a six-week ban in 2021, but Republicans decided to call a special session after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It is not our bill. Were not the ones trying to control their bodies, Democratic Rep. Leon Stavrinakis said.The leader of a non-profit organization that fights for womens health and economic rights was offended that Republicans saw the debate as a game.Weve got to get past the point of seeing this as a political game and start seeing the impact it has on real peoples lives. And Im afraid thats been lost in the Statehouse today, said Ann Warner, CEO of the Womens Rights and Empowerment Network.Republicans who have nearly twice as many members as Democrats, took an hour break just before the vote to get their most conservative members to agree to the exceptions.Other changes voted down in the debate included language supporters said would protect in vitro fertilization and birth control, and proposals that would allow prosecutors to charge a women who gets an abortion with murder.About 100 people gathered in the Statehouse lobby for the debate. They chanted phrases like Abortion is health care and My body, my choice and drew honks from passing cars. Law enforcement closed the House gallery Tuesday. South Carolina currently has a six-week ban but the South Carolina Supreme Court suspended the law earlier this month while the justices decide on a Planned Parenthood lawsuit that says the ban is an unreasonable invasion of privacy under the state constitution. The decision leaves South Carolinas abortion ban at 20 weeks for now.Earlier in August Indiana passed a near-total ban set to take effect Sept. 15 with exceptions for rape, incest and if the mothers life is in danger. West Virginias House and Senate couldnt agree on stricter abortion rules in a July session.Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws designed to outlaw most abortions when the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the constitutional right to end a pregnancy in June.South Carolina leaders have watched those developments carefully, as well as events several weeks ago in Kansas, where nearly 60 of voters rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed the states conservative Legislature to ban abortion. Republican Donald Trump received 56 of the 2020 presidential vote in Kansas. Trump won 55 in South Carolina. The bill currently allows abortions if a mothers life is in danger and then lists a number of different medical emergencies that would fit into that exception.Republican Gov. Henry McMaster hasnt given his opinion on this specific bill but has said he would like to see a day where there are no abortions in the state.This is a good starting point for the Senate to begin its deliberations, McMasters spokesman Brian Symmes said.Pollard is a corps member for the Associated PressReport for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Initially, the bill was rejected, but after procedural maneuvers by Republicans, it was brought back with these exceptions included. The final vote was 67-38.

The bill permits abortions up to 12 weeks in cases of rape, provided the woman informs a doctor, who must report the incident to the authorities. It also allows abortion when the mother’s life is in danger. Some conservative lawmakers opposed these exceptions but ultimately supported the bill.

The debate included attempts to amend the bill to address concerns about in vitro fertilization, birth control, and criminal charges for women obtaining abortions, all of which were rejected. The bill now moves to the state Senate, where similar abortion restrictions have faced challenges.

South Carolina currently has a suspended six-week abortion ban, with the state Supreme Court deliberating on its constitutionality. Governor Henry McMaster supports the goal of eliminating abortion in the state, but has not taken a stance on this specific bill. The passage of the bill comes amid ongoing national discussions about abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade."

Last week, the latest incident occurred when the local group, St. Joseph County Right to Life, discovered spray paint on their pro-life billboard. The billboards message simply reads Alive. Human. Unprotected., and directs viewers to RoevWade.us, a project of St. Joseph County Right to Life which provides information on the infamous Supreme Court decision. Vandals spraypainted the billboard with an anti-police acronym ACAB and another obscure message which appears to read, Kill 200. This is the third incident of vandalism that has struck St. Joseph County Right to Life in recent months. Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News! The first occurrence was last September, just after the discovery of 2,246 aborted babies remains at the home of local abortionist Ulrich Klopfer. In the days following the news, the pro-life group discovered spray paint on four of their bench ads near the local abortion facility. Those ads promoted life-affirming resources such as Abortion Pill Reversal and Womens Care Center, a local pregnancy help center. The second incident was in December, shortly before Christmas. Again, the pro-life group found spray paint on six of their bench ads promoting resources for women in need. This is concerning, said Jackie Appleman, executive director of Right to Life Michiana. The vandalism is escalating from simply hiding helpful resources to promoting violence. Unfortunately, this isnt surprising because the abortion movement is intolerant to other views and promotes violence. Tweet This The vandalism is escalating from simply hiding helpful pregnancy help resources to promoting violence"" The vandalism comes amidst tensions over the controversial opening of an unlicensed abortion facility in South Bend. In response to the facilitys opening, pro-life groups have been promoting alternatives to abortion throughout the city. Womens Care Center, a local pro-life pregnancy help center even opened a new location right across the street from the facilitysomething which South Bend Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg attempted to stop. As concerned as St. Joseph County Right to Life is about the upswing in tensions, they remain mission-focused. Nothing the abortion movement does is going to stop us, says Melanie Garcia, outreach manager for St. Joseph County Right to Life.

The latest act of vandalism occurred when St. Joseph County Right to Life discovered graffiti on a billboard that read “Alive. Human. Unprotected.” and directed people to RoevWade.us, a project focused on the Roe v. Wade decision. The graffiti included an anti-police acronym and a cryptic message. This is the third incident of vandalism, following similar acts in September and December, where ads promoting life-affirming resources were defaced with spray paint.

The vandalism appears to be linked to tensions surrounding the opening of an unlicensed abortion facility in South Bend. In response, pro-life organizations, including Women’s Care Center, have been actively promoting alternatives to abortion, with the center even opening a location across from the abortion facility. Despite the escalating vandalism, St. Joseph County Right to Life remains committed to their mission of advocating for life and educating the public on the harms of abortion, with their outreach manager, Melanie Garcia, affirming that the violence will not deter their efforts."

Pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates discuss We asked advocates their thoughts on the ""heartbeat"" law, what they think will happens as a result and what they plan to do to support women. More Videos Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Author Hope Ford Published 557 AM EDT July 21, 2022 Updated 649 PM EDT July 21, 2022 ATLANTA Following the news that Georgia's ""heartbeat"" bill is now the law in the state, 11Alive is hearing from advocates who work in both the anti-abortion and pro-choice communities. Suzanne Guy and Tamara Stevens have been in and around the Georgia State Capitol since day one, either defending or trying to get the heartbeat bill overturned. Guy is the founder of 40 days for Life and Life Initiatives, says she is pro-life and has long supported what she calls a common-sense law. She also helps pregnant mothers seek resources to help if they're family planning or to help them reconsider abortions by providing resources during their pregnancies. Stevens is a part of the Handmaid Coalition, a grassroots organization born out of the 2019 legislative session surrounding the bill. The group is known to wear costumes similar to the uniforms worn in the popular dystopian drama, ""The Handmaid's Tale."" She is also a Planned Parenthood escort. We asked both advocates their thoughts on the bill, what they think will happen as a result and what they plan to do to support women seeking abortions or pregnant mothers. INITIAL REACTION Guy I just started thanking God, this is such an answer to prayer. We have waited so long for this bill, this legislation to be allowed to go into effect because as we know, Gov. Kemp signed it back in May of 2019."" Stevens When the Supreme Court draft was leaked, we knew this was coming. Doesnt make it any easier. There are actual women who had appointments scheduled for tomorrow that are being canceled. WHY THEY OPPOSE OR SUPPORT THE BILL Guy It is going to save thousands of lives of innocent children and also spare thousands of women and men the regret of abortion. All the precious Georgians whose lives will be protected and saved, and what that means for future generations. Because those children who are saved will have children, and they'll have children. Stevens The fact that we live in a state that has the highest maternal mortality rate and now were going to force women to go through this, it makes no sense. It is primarily going to affect poor women in rural communities more than in cities and definitely Black and brown women will be affected in ways we cant even imagine. POSSIBLE FALLOUT FROM THE BILL Guy As for those precious moms, I care deeply about women who are in crisis, unplanned or unwanted pregnancies. And there are so many fantastic resources out there and there's so much help for them. And they will be spared the regret and trauma of abortion, that abortion causes women and men. Stevens There are women who will quickly choose to have an abortion the minute they find out theyre pregnant under six weeks, that may have chosen otherwise if they had some time to process it. There are women in abusive relationships that are going to face this abuse, and if they dont kill them, they will beat them until they spontaneously miscarry. HOW THIS PLAYS OUT DURING ELECTIONS Guy Republicans coming together and supporting Brian Kemp. And more than ever, we need unity in the conservative movement. Republicans need to fully get behind Governor Kemp. Stevens The messaging, the signs, the debates, I dont think any of that is going to matter this year, its all going to be getting out the vote. The turnout. People who previously identified as Republican voters, I think theres going to be a lot of quiet turnover, particularly among women. WHAT'S NEXT AS FAR AS RESOURCES Guy Pregnancy resource centers are a fantastic resource for women that find themselves in an unplanned, unwanted or crisis pregnancy. If the reason that they are seeking an abortion or want an abortion is financial, my organization and other organizations and the pregnancy resource centers help women get their rent paid for, we throw baby showers, there are so many things, we help try to find them a car if they need a car. But it's also about loving those women and men while they're pregnant and after they're pregnant."" Stevens There's already great organizations that are run by Black and brown women and Planned Parenthood that have spent months preparing for this. We just have got to fund, weve got to fund peoples travel to other states, weve got to do whatever it takes to ensure that the women of Georgia have the support and the access to abortion that they need.

No Thanks Allow","The article discusses the perspectives of pro-life and pro-choice advocates regarding Georgia’s “heartbeat” bill, which bans most abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around six weeks of pregnancy. The bill was signed into law by Governor Brian Kemp in 2019 but went into effect following a court ruling in 2022.

Pro-Life Advocate: Suzanne Guy
Guy, a pro-life advocate and founder of 40 Days for Life, expresses strong support for the law, viewing it as a “common-sense” measure to save lives. She believes the bill will protect unborn children and reduce the emotional and psychological trauma she believes is caused by abortion. Guy emphasizes the support available to women facing unplanned pregnancies, such as resources for financial assistance and parenting help, provided by pregnancy resource centers. She also predicts that the law will positively impact future generations, as saved children will eventually have families of their own.

Pro-Choice Advocate: Tamara Stevens
Stevens, a member of the Handmaid Coalition and a Planned Parenthood escort, opposes the law, arguing it disproportionately harms poor, rural, and particularly Black and brown women, who may struggle more than others with access to abortion services. She highlights Georgia’s high maternal mortality rate and fears the law will worsen the situation, especially for women in abusive relationships or with limited access to healthcare. Stevens stresses the urgency of supporting women by funding travel to states where abortion remains accessible and ensuring resources for those who seek abortions.

Impact on Elections
Both advocates also speculate on how the law could influence upcoming elections. Guy supports Governor Kemp and calls for unity within the Republican Party, believing that the law will resonate with conservative voters. Stevens, however, argues that the real influence will be seen in voter turnout, particularly among women, including some who may shift away from traditional Republican support due to the law.

Future Resources and Actions
Guy emphasizes the role of pregnancy resource centers in assisting women with unplanned pregnancies by offering financial help, baby showers, and other services. She stresses a compassionate approach to supporting both women and men during pregnancy. Stevens calls for increased funding for abortion access, including support for travel to other states and financial assistance for organizations, particularly those led by Black and brown women, to ensure women can still access reproductive services.

The article illustrates the deep divide between the two sides on the issue, with each advocate focused on what they believe will most effectively support women and protect life."

Equality is women and girls pursuing and realizing their fullest potential. Its girls feeling safe in their communitiesand their homes. Equality is women and girls having choice over their bodies and their own lives. And its more women in positions of powerand redefining what power is. Are we there yet? Unfortunately, no. But women and girls are persisting and making their voices heard. Its been incredible to see them band together, demand justice, and drive change at every level to have a transformative impact across the globe. This piece is part of our featured series, The Future Is Hers, celebrating the power of women and girls around the world. Explore the stories Millions of women, from Mexico to Indonesia, continue to take to the streets in marches and rallies across the globe to call attention to pressing issues, from equal pay to femicide.

Thanks to the tireless efforts of women and girls, activists and organizations, all 54 countries in Africa have committed to ending female genital mutilation, and countries across the Middle East such as Lebanon and Jordan are amending their laws to prevent and end impunity for gender-based violence. In Tanzania, the top court ruled that marriage under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, while in India the supreme court overturned an archaic law that allowed sex with minors, with or without consent, to protect young brides. Powerful feminist and women-led movements are emerging around the world to tackle our biggest challenges, from climate justice to economic inequality to the rise of populism. And we are seeing the power and leadership of young womenfrom Greta Thunberg to Brazils Artemisa Xakriab to Little Miss Flint Mari Copenywho are carrying on the work of their foremothers, like Wangari Maathai and Berta Cceres, and changing the face of activism for generations to come. Mari Copeny, known as Little Miss Flint, speaks at a rally outside the White House in Washington, DC.Aaron P. BernsteinGetty Images These efforts are a testament to the commitment of millions of women and girls who refuse to be seen as second-class citizens and are rising up to fight for a more just world. But, at the same time, we, as women, know our work is far from done. While women have made tremendous strides, the reality is we are still a hundred years away from closing the gender gap. Globally, women earn 24 percent less than men, and more than 2.7 billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men. While a historic number of women are running for political office in the US and women like Ethiopias Sahle-Work Zewde, Chiles Michelle Bachelet, and Liberias Ellen Johnson Sirleaf broke glass ceilings as their countries first female leaders, a mere 22 of 197 heads of state are women. The Equal Rights Amendment has yet to be ratified in the US, gender-based violence remains a global pandemic that affects one in three women, and, last year, 20 member states of the UNrepresenting 1.3 billion peopledeclared that women have no international right to abortion. Representatives of the League of Women Voters en route to the 1920 Democratic Convention.Hulton ArchiveGetty Images Fannie Lou Hamer, Victoria Gray, and Annie Devine of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party demonstrate for their right to vote in 1965.Bettmann Archive These are enormous challenges, and they only scratch the surface of what we, as a society, need to address and what we, at the Ford Foundation, are working hard to tackle with our partners. Gender equality requires dismantling the underlying structures and patriarchal systems that reinforce the discrimination, oppression, and violence that girls and women have encountered throughout historyand still face today. Only by addressing the root causes of inequality can we, as a global society, build a future that benefits not just women and girls but everyone. But change is achievable. This year marks two seminal moments for gender equalitythe 25th anniversary of the UN World Conference for Women in Beijing and the 100th anniversary of womens right to vote in America although some women of color, particularly black and Hispanic women in the South, Native Americans, and Asians were effectively unable to exercise that right until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We, as a society and as a foundation, have an opportunity to build on these remarkable gains, lean into the momentum fueled by women and girls around the world, and forge a future where gender equality is no longer an aspiration but a lived reality. Secretary General Gertrude Mongella left and conference president Chen Muhua right shake hands to close out the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing.Emmanuel DunandAFP via Getty Images So, how do we move forward? How do we close the gap and unleash the full potential of women and girls worldwide? How do we catalyze the efforts of the disruptors, the trailblazers, and the game changers who are carving the path to parity? At Ford, we have been committed to advancing gender equality for nearly 60 years, supporting hundreds of intrepid activists, organizations, and initiatives with more than 3 billion in grants. From the very beginning, Ford followed the lead of women pioneering the feminist movement in the United States and learned by listening to the women on the ground in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America as we expanded our support worldwide. Our approach has always been about investing in the ideas, individuals, and institutions on the frontlines, so they can carry their work forward and scale their impact. With women and girls making up half of the global population, we have always believed it is imperative that we not only heed their call but also stand with them and support solutions they develop to address the challenges they deem most pressing. For example, in the 1960s, when Ford started focusing on womens rights, birth control was becoming legal and the feminist movement was unfolding across the US, so we went to the women and organizations leading the chargelike Gloria Steinem and the Ms. Foundation, Planned Parenthood, and the Womens Law Fund, the first nonprofit to address sexual discriminationand supported their work to ensure that all women have autonomy over their bodies and the opportunity to shape their own lives. Today, with Roe v. Wade under attack and 800 bills introduced at the state level to limit sexual and reproductive rights, Ford is doubling down on the feminist movements and women-led organizations at the center of the fight to make sure the important progress thats been made isnt reversed. The Center for Reproductive Rightsa longtime grantee and formative player that has strengthened laws and policies to protect womens rights in more than 50 countriesis transforming how governments, courts, and society as a whole understand reproductive rights under the leadership of Nancy Northup. This month, she and her team will be heading to present arguments to the Supreme Court in June Medical Services v. Gee, a case that came out of Louisiana that could open the door for states to essentially eliminate abortion access. Newer grantees like SisterSong and Women with a Vision are speaking up for women on the margins who havent always experienced the same protections as white women despite progress made and demonstrating that race, ethnicity, economic status, and other factors intersect with reproductive rights. Nancy Northup of the Center for Reproductive Rights center speaks to a crowd of activists.Pete MarovichGetty Images Its by listening to and learning from these amazing women and organizations that we have gained a better understanding of where to direct our support to make a more meaningful impact. We all have a responsibility, especially as funders, to go where the need is greatestand that need should be determined by those most proximate to the problems. At Ford, we know that achieving our mission depends on seeing the rights of women and girls protected and their equality realized, so, as the world has evolved, we have continued to adapt our strategies based on what weve learned throughout our journey. For instance, we first started supporting efforts to stop gender-based violence in 1994. By working with womens groups in such places as India, South Africa, and the Philippines, we saw its growing threat and inextricable link to gender inequality. At that time, there were no global commitments to end gender-based violence. While today there are more than 118 laws, treaties, and international declarations in place, the majority of global funding is going toward US and European institutions, leaving little for those organizations in the Global South, best situated to develop interventions in their contexts. To address this, Ford is putting its resources behind the Global South, whether its advocating for more funding across the philanthropic community or supporting an agenda set by the regions key players, such as the African Womens Development Fund, and emerging voices like the women and girls who make up the FRIDA Young Feminists Fund. We share their hope to shift deep-seated cultural norms and practices that condone violence and further entrench gender inequalityand thats why we are letting their expertise guide our funding, and focusing on prevention and building a strong, united, women-led, feminist-minded movement that will accelerate change locally and globally. Of course, Ford is just one foundation and no one entity can tackle the issue of gender equality alone. This work requires a concerted, collaborative effort from activists, organizations, funders, policy makers, and governments. Partnerships are critical to scaling effective solutions driven by women and girlsand there has never been a more urgent and more opportune time to join forces in this fight. When partnerships are thoughtful and strategic, they can make a lasting difference in the lives of women and girls today and for generations to come. Thousands of feminists march for equal rights in Lima, Peru, on International Womens Day in 2019.Carlos Garcia GranthonFotoholica PressLightRocket via Getty Images Weve seen this with our partnerships across the philanthropic community. Over the past few years, we have worked to create the Collective Future Fund, partnering with NoVo Foundation, Unbound Philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, and the Gates Foundation, among others, to support those groups of women most vulnerable to violenceand weve established the Girls First Fund, a multi-donor collaborative that champions community-led efforts to combat child marriage. These joint efforts have enabled each philanthropic partner to bring their expertise to the table, share knowledge gained from their grantees, and create spaces to innovate and strategize togetherall while combining our support to make a bigger, more significant dent in the fight for gender equality. Thats why, despite all were confronting as a gender and as a world in 2020, I am incredibly hopeful for the future. Our courageous, steadfast grantees, past and present, have catalyzed movements, fought for laws to be put into place, and shifted the global conversation around gender. Theyalong with the countless women and girls across the globeare proving that change is possible. They have laid the groundwork while teaching us how to be a smarter, more effective foundation. Now is the time to step up our support of those women and girls at the heart of the action. We, as a society, know that when women have equal power and equal opportunity, everyone benefits. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of my heroes and a former Ford grantee, says, Real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time. If we want to build a world that is fair, just, and free of inequality, we need to think bigger, act bolder and keep forging ahead.

LinkedIn Facebook Threads Instagram YouTube","The article “The Unfinished Business of Gender Equality” by Hilary Pennington, Executive Vice President of Programs at the Ford Foundation, highlights the ongoing global struggle for gender equality, focusing on the progress made and the challenges still ahead.

It celebrates significant achievements such as the growing presence of women in political power, such as in Rwanda and Ethiopia, and landmark victories for reproductive rights in countries like Kenya, Mexico, and Chile. Movements like MeToo have also transformed global conversations around gender, power, and sexual harassment. Efforts against gender-based violence have gained traction, with more global commitments and legal protections emerging.

However, despite these successes, Pennington stresses that the gender gap remains wide, with women still earning significantly less than men, facing legal restrictions on employment, and experiencing rampant gender-based violence. Although more women are running for office, the number of female heads of state remains disproportionately low. Furthermore, gender inequality continues to be perpetuated by patriarchal systems, which require structural change to achieve true equality.

The Ford Foundation has supported gender equality for over 60 years, investing in grassroots organizations and feminist movements worldwide, particularly in the Global South, to address gender-based violence, reproductive rights, and more. This support includes partnerships with other philanthropies to amplify the impact of initiatives that fight gender inequality, such as the Collective Future Fund and the Girls First Fund.

Looking ahead, Pennington calls for continued collaboration and bold action to close the gender gap, emphasizing that true equality will benefit everyone, not just women and girls. The article underscores that while there have been notable strides, the journey toward full gender equality is far from complete and requires sustained effort from activists, organizations, and governments globally."

Wade ruling that affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion.THANKS TO OUR SPONSORBecome a SponsorIt doesnt feel real. Theres so much hope and vibrancy and happiness and joy at this thing, said Jordan Moorman of Cincinnati. I really do believe that were in a post-Roe generation.People attend the March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington, Friday, Jan. 21, 2022. The March for Life, for decades an annual protest against abortion, arrives this year as the Supreme Court has indicated it will allow states to impose tighter restrictions on abortion with a ruling in the coming months.Susan Walsh APThe rally, held on the anniversary of the Roe decision, is taking place amid a COVID-19 surge that limited turnout at the National Mall. Some abortion opponents posted on the event's Facebook page that they will not attend because of COVID-19 vaccine mandates for people going to restaurants and other places in the District of Columbia.Still, the rally drew a crowd of thousands on a sunny but frigid day, with a heavy contingent of young people and students bussed in by schools and church groups. The mood was overwhelmingly optimistic, with many treating the end of Roe v Wade as an inevitability.Hopefully this will be the last March for Life, said Father Andrew Rudmann, a Catholic priest from New Orleans, who was attending his 11th event.Rudmann said previous marches may have had larger crowds but he doesnt recall this level of optimism. He said the crowds grew gigantic under former President Donald Trump and the movements enthusiasm grew with each Trump Supreme Court appointee. He proudly pointed out that his home Archdiocese of New Orleans includes the Catholic high school that educated Trumps last appointee, Supreme Court Justice Amy Comey Barrett.THANKS TO OUR SPONSORBecome a SponsorSometimes I would come to the March and it would be great to be united with people who share my beliefs, but there would also be this heaviness, he said. This time the whole language and vibe is different.Abortion rights groups worry that at least 26 states are in line to further limit abortion access if Roe is weakened or overturned. In December, the court indicated in a major case that it would uphold a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, and allow states to ban abortion even earlier. The Mississippi case directly challenges Roe.Courts have also dealt Texas abortion providers a string of defeats over efforts to block a law that since September has banned abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant. Another loss for Texas clinics came Thursday, when the Supreme Court refused to speed up the ongoing challenge over the law, which providers say is now likely to stay in effect for the foreseeable future.This law is cruel and unconstitutional, and I am deeply disappointed that our judicial system has done very little to stop it, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Womans Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas.Lawmakers from both parties weighed in Friday to note the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and reflect on the shifting political landscape surrounding abortion.It has been an eye-opening year for the cause of life in America, and we have made significant progress in defending our youngest and most vulnerable,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House.The stakes are higher than ever, with the health and autonomy of women and families across the country hanging in the balance as Republicans work to methodically challenge and overturn Roe,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Its time to sound the alarm and make clear decisions about our bodies, our health care and our future belong to us.""Mississippi state Sen. Joey Fillingane, a Republican who pushed for the state's strict abortion laws, said he is not able to attend the March For Life in Washington but is pleased that he and two GOP colleagues will be recognized there. Mississippi has just one abortion clinic, and Fillingane said the state should next target access to abortion-inducing medication.If Roe were nullified, Fillingane said he expects states to take different approaches to setting their own abortion laws.I think thats the way it should be, he said. The laws in California, based on their population and what they want, may be very different than the laws in Mississippi based on what our population feels about the issue of life.THANKS TO OUR SPONSORBecome a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSORBecome a SponsorOPBs First Look newsletterSign up to get important news and culture from around the Northwest, delivered to your inbox six days a week.EmailPlease leave this field blankSign UpTags Politics, Abortion, ProtestOPBs critical reporting and inspiring programs are made possible by the power of member support.

Wade. The rally occurred against the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s imminent decision on a case challenging Roe, which many anticipated would result in the court allowing states to impose stricter abortion laws. This rally, a long-standing annual event, had a notably optimistic tone, with participants, including many young people, expressing hope that Roe would soon be overturned.

The mood was buoyed by the belief that the end of Roe was near, especially with the increasing influence of conservative justices appointed during the Trump administration. Some, like Father Andrew Rudmann, expressed confidence that this could be the last March for Life, emphasizing the growing momentum of the pro-life movement.

Abortion rights groups, however, voiced concern that if Roe were overturned, at least 26 states would likely impose further abortion restrictions. The Mississippi case, which challenges Roe directly, had already indicated the Court might uphold a ban on abortions after 15 weeks. Texas’ restrictive abortion law, banning procedures as early as six weeks, further highlighted the shifting landscape.

Lawmakers from both sides reflected on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, with Republicans celebrating progress in the anti-abortion movement, while Democrats raised alarms about the impact on women’s rights and autonomy. Mississippi’s state senator, Joey Fillingane, highlighted that different states would have varying laws if Roe were overturned, with states like California possibly passing more liberal laws compared to more conservative states like Mississippi."

Wade abortion decision. Credit Jason Garza for The Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. The U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional protection for abortion in a much-anticipated ruling Friday that will greatly affect access to reproductive health care in Texas and beyond. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions from our readers. What is Roe v. Wade? Roe v. Wade is a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case that challenged Texas law that banned abortions except when needed to save the pregnant persons life. Previously, the courts decision in Roe guaranteed the constitutional right to have an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. The case was overturned Friday by the courts decision in Dobbs v. Jackson a suit against a Mississippi law that banned nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The ruling in Dobbs doesnt mean that abortions are now unconstitutional, but it leaves to individual states to decide whether to protect the right to an abortion. Why was Roe v. Wade overturned? The court held that abortion is a question of profound moral and social importance. In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito argued that the holding in Roe wasnt well founded in history or precedent, and that abortion is a political matter that should be left up to citizens and their elected officials to decide. The Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral, and this Court likewise must be scrupulously neutral, he wrote. In their dissent, the three liberal justices of the court argue that the justices who decided Roe acknowledged the moral issue at hand by allowing states to regulate abortions after viability. Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todays decision is certain the curtailment of womens rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens, the dissenters wrote. Is abortion still legal in Texas? No. Texas trigger abortion ban is set to go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues its final judgment, which typically happens a month after the initial opinion. The law will be a near-complete ban on abortion in the state of Texas. People who get abortions would not be prosecuted under the law, but doctors who perform illegal abortions could be sentenced to life in prison or fined up to 100,000. Its not clear if the states trigger laws are even necessary to ban the procedure. Abortion clinics said Friday they were no longer able to provide abortion services after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that state laws that banned abortion before Roe v. Wade and were never repealed could now be in effect in Texas. Practically, the procedure is already banned here. Does the law apply to military bases and Native American reservations? The U.S. military doesnt prohibit abortions, but the military also doesnt cover the costs of abortions or offer abortions at military facilities, according to The Wall Street Journal. Members of the military serving in states that ban abortions would have to travel out of state to obtain an abortion legally. Meanwhile, abortions have historically been hard to access on Native American reservations because of the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortions. Because the Indian Health Service is federally funded, the agency already restricts abortions to cases in which the pregnant persons life would be endangered by carrying to term. Could this law apply to me if I got an abortion in the past? No. Based on the ex post facto clause in Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution, states cannot pass laws and retroactively apply them to actions taken before they were passed. Justice Brett Kavanagh wrote in his concurring opinion that states could not impose punishments on people who performed or received abortions prior to the Friday ruling. Can I get abortion in Texas if I have a life-threatening pregnancy? Yes. Texas ban on abortion makes exceptions for cases in which an abortion would save the pregnant patients life or prevent substantial impairment of major bodily function. Are there exceptions in Texas ban on abortion for rape or incest? No, there are no exceptions for rape or incest in Texas ban on abortion. Advocates say this could trap victims of domestic abuse in their abusive relationships. Women who are pregnant or recently gave birth are twice as likely to die by homicide than any other cause of maternal mortality, most often at the hands of an intimate partner. Is it still legal for Texans to get abortions in other states? Yes. There are 27 states where the right to an abortion remains protected by state law, according to Politico. Under the Constitution, interstate commerce is left to Congress to regulate. Kavanagh wrote in his concurring opinion that the right to interstate travel likely outlaws states from preventing their residents from traveling to another state to get abortions. The court didnt officially rule on whether such laws would be constitutional. In the dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan worried that leaving the door open could lead some states to pass such laws, and that the cost of travel would cause inequities in who can and cant access an abortion. Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from todays decision, they wrote. Are birth control and emergency contraceptives still legal? Yes. The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson overturns only the right to an abortion. Contraceptives such as birth control and Plan B continue to be constitutionally protected under separate Supreme Court cases, and the majority opinion stressed that it does not apply to separate rights, such as contraceptives. However, Justice Clarence Thomas issued a concurring opinion inviting challenges to rights such as contraceptives, same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships. Who will be affected by todays ruling? Advocates say the ruling will disproportionately impact pregnant people who lack the funds to travel out of state and Black mothers. Three-quarters of people accessing abortion are low income and poor, said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, abortion provider at Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston. While wealthy Texans may be able to travel to New Mexico or Colorado to obtain an abortion, travel adds additional burdens to those who already struggle to afford the procedure itself, which typically costs about 1,000 to 4,000. However, some people may be able to get assistance through charity funds that provide reimbursements for abortion-related expenses. Black women are also disproportionately impacted by death or serious illness due to pregnancy. According to a study by the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, the rate of severe maternal morbidity for Black women in Texas is nearly double that of white women. Is there precedent for the court rolling back rights like this? Overturned decisions are rare for the Supreme Court. According to an analysis by Quartz, less than 2 of rulings overturn prior holdings. Famously overturned cases include Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the separate but equal doctrine for school segregation and was later overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, and Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned Bowers v. Hardwick and established a constitutional right for two people of the same sex to engage in intimate sexual conduct.

Wade, which had guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling, issued in the Dobbs v. Jackson case, leaves the issue of abortion up to individual states. As a result, abortion is no longer legal in Texas, where a trigger law enforces a near-total abortion ban, effective 30 days after the ruling.

Key Points:

	•	Roe v. Wade: The 1973 decision established the right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson overturned this, stating that abortion is a matter for states to decide, rather than a constitutional right.
	•	Abortion in Texas: Texas has enacted a trigger law that bans most abortions, with exceptions only when the mother’s life is at risk. Abortion clinics in Texas ceased providing services immediately after the ruling, citing the reactivation of pre-Roe laws.
	•	Military & Native American Reservations: The military does not cover abortions but allows service members to travel out of state for the procedure. Access on Native American reservations is restricted due to federal funding limitations.
	•	Previous Abortions: The law does not retroactively affect past abortions. Those who received or performed abortions before the ruling are not subject to prosecution.
	•	Exceptions for Life-Threatening Pregnancies: Abortion is allowed if necessary to save the life of the pregnant person, but there are no exceptions for cases of rape or incest.
	•	Impact on Access: Texans can still travel to other states where abortion is legal, but access may be financially burdensome, particularly for low-income individuals. Black women may be disproportionately affected due to higher maternal mortality rates.
	•	Contraception and Other Rights: Birth control and emergency contraceptives like Plan B remain legal. However, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that other rights, such as those related to contraception and same-sex marriage, could be challenged.
	•	Disproportionate Impact: The decision is expected to significantly affect low-income people and Black women, who face higher maternal health risks and may struggle with the costs of out-of-state travel for an abortion.
	•	Legal Precedent: The ruling is notable as the Supreme Court rarely overturns past decisions. Similar reversals have occurred in other landmark cases like Plessy v. Ferguson and Bowers v. Hardwick.

This decision represents a significant shift in U.S. reproductive rights, leaving many states with the authority to regulate abortion access, with Texas among those enforcing strict limitations."

Judge Celene Gogerty found there was no process for reversing a permanent injunction that blocked the abortion law in 2019. Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a statement that she would appeal the decision to the Iowa Supreme Court. Current state law bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but Reynolds asked the courts to reverse the 2019 decision that blocked a bill she had signed into law the previous year. That law prohibited abortions once cardiac activity can be detected the fetal heartbeat concept which usually happens around six weeks of pregnancy and is often before many women know theyre pregnant. Reynolds argued that because of decisions earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Iowa Supreme Court that found woman have no constitutional right to abortion, the Iowa judge should reverse the 2019 decision blocking the abortion law. READ MORE Indiana doctor defends actions in 10-year-old rape victims abortion Lawyers for Iowas largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, countered that there is no precedent or legal support for reversing a decision finalized by a judge years earlier. They said Reynolds must go through the legislative process to pass a new law. Reynolds did not appeal the decision when it was handed down in 2019. At that time, Judge Michael Hupperts decision was based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent, as well as an Iowa Supreme Court decision in 2018 that declared abortion a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution. Reynolds, who supports outlawing abortions, decided to turn to the courts to impose stricter abortion limits instead of calling a special session of the legislature to pass a new law. Although Iowas law blocked by the courts seeks to prevent abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, this does not easily translate to medical science. Thats because the point where advanced technology can detect that first visual flutter, the embryo isnt yet a fetus, and it doesnt have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus eight weeks after fertilization. The Iowa law contains exceptions for medical emergencies, including threats to the mothers life, rape, incest, and fetal abnormality.

Support for NewsHour Provided By","In December 2022, an Iowa judge, Celene Gogerty, blocked an effort by Governor Kim Reynolds to reinstate a 2018 law that would ban most abortions in the state after cardiac activity can be detected, typically around six weeks of pregnancy. This decision upheld a 2019 ruling by Judge Michael Huppert, which had blocked the law, stating that it violated the Iowa Constitution’s protection of abortion rights. Reynolds, a proponent of restricting abortion access, had requested that the courts reverse the 2019 ruling, citing recent U.S. and Iowa Supreme Court decisions that declared there is no constitutional right to abortion.

However, Planned Parenthood, Iowa’s largest abortion provider, argued that the 2019 ruling was final and that Reynolds should pursue the legislative process to change the law. The 2019 decision was based on both U.S. Supreme Court precedents and a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court ruling that recognized abortion as a fundamental right in the state. Reynolds, instead of calling a special legislative session, chose to seek stricter abortion limits through the court system.

The law in question was based on the detection of a fetal heartbeat, a controversial and medically complex issue, as the point of detection occurs before the embryo is officially termed a fetus and has a fully developed heart. The law includes exceptions for cases involving medical emergencies, threats to the mother’s life, rape, incest, and fetal abnormalities. Governor Reynolds expressed her intention to appeal the decision to the Iowa Supreme Court."

We Won! cheered the New Orleans Abortion Fund. All day long, triumphant messages flitted across my screenfrom the ACLU, the Center for Reproductive Rights, Vote ProChoice, Vote Mama, and many more. We Are Shook, was the headline from Rewire, the online reproductive justice news service. SCOTUS just protected abortion access. Whew. June Medical Services v. Russo was the case that pro-choicers feared would devastate abortion rights in Louisiana and give the signal for open season on abortion around the nation. A win for the state would have meant upholding a law requiring abortion clinic doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, something all but impossible to obtain all but one of Louisianas three clinics would have been shuttered. The strange part is, in 2016, the court decided an identical case from Texas, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt. That year, the court ruled 5 to 4 that the law served no health purpose but only made abortion harder to get. That the court would revisit the issue now that hard-line conservative Bret Kavanaugh has replaced moderate Anthony Kennedy seemed like a bad omen. But surprise. John Roberts, who had voted to uphold the restriction in Whole Womans Health, voted against it this timenot because he has changed his mind about abortion restrictions he has been opposed to abortion for his entire public career, and in his separate opinion wrote that Whole Womans Health was wrongly decided but on the narrow ground of respecting precedent. Should a different restriction make its way to the court, one that hasnt already been struck down, theres nothing in Robertss opinion today that would require him to reject it. Robertss opinion is less an endorsement of the right than it is a warning that litigants should not overreach, writes Ian Millhiser in Vox. Well take our small victories where weve got them, even if they might be repealed tomorrow, reproductive justice theorist and activist Loretta Ross told me when I reached her by phone. Theres always a Sword of Damocles hanging over our head. Too right. Thats why Im breaking out the champagne, but only allowing myself one glass. The next case to come before the courtand there are several in the pipelinemight strike Roberts differently. He is the swing vote now. courtroom drama John Roberts Is Not Your Friend Elie Mystal Naturally, everyone is trying to get inside Robertss head. Is he trying to shore up the Supreme Courts nonpartisan reputation, battered by nakedly pro-Republican decisions like Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and Shelby County v. Holder which gutted the Voting Rights Act and for which he wrote the majority decision? Does he want to help Trump get reelected? Is he laying the groundwork for anti-abortion decisions down the road? Does he not want to go down in history as the man who overturned Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed Roe and barred restrictions that placed an undue burden on a womans ability to get an abortion? Maybe a bit of all four.

That 70 percent of Americans support Roe, that one in four women will have had an abortion by menopause, that countless women still living had illegal abortions before Roe, that legal abortion underwrites every aspect of modern womens lives, and mens lives toonone of that has the traction in our politics or our legal system that you would expect. Donald Trump was pro-choice before he ran for president, a fact that reassured a lot of naive people during the campaign, but he has done more to restrict access to birth control and abortion than any president in modern American history. In his three years and change, he has nominated Kavanaugh and Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, placed on the federal bench 200 judges, the most recent of whom, Cory Wilson, has called for a complete and immediate reversal of Roe, and seeded departments and agencies like Health and Human Services with anti-choice fanatics. Little by little, like that proverbial frog relaxing in slowly heating water, weve gotten used to abortion being hard to find and hard to pay for. Louisiana has three clinics that serve a million women of reproductive age, the abortion sociologist Carole Joffe told me. In 1992 there were 17 in 2014 there were five. View our current issue Joffes eye-opening new book, Obstacle Course The Everyday Struggle to Get an Abortion in America, co-authored with David Cohen, describes in minute detail the effect on real people of the more than 1,000 abortion restrictions passed since Roe was decided. Especially for poor and low-income women, who make up the majority of abortion patients, restrictions that might not seem so onerous to a better-off woman within reach of a clinica 36-hour waiting period, for examplecan make for serious problems. Class and geographical disparities in abortion access are part of the reason anything short of a direct threat to Roe has often failed to excite a critical mass of pro-choice voters. I worry that people who dont obsess about abortion 247 will think, well okay, its safe, Joffe told me. I worry that the pro-choice movement will overstate the victory, and part of the electorate that would have been particularly motivated to vote wont be so now. I worry about that too. So let me be clear What we got on Monday was less a victory than a temporary reprieve. If Trump ekes out a win in November, Roberts may not be the swing vote for long. Trump will almost certainly get the chance to replace at least one and possibly more of the liberals of the Supreme Court with hard-liners like his previous nominees Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, and nominate enough federal judges to turn the appeals courts hard-right and anti-abortion for a generation or even longer. Perhaps Roe will be overturned outright perhaps it will be allowed to remain the law of the land, while the court simply upholds every restriction that comes before it. Pro-choicers have one chance to stop this. Lets not waste it. Submit a correction Send a letter to the editor Reprints permissions Thank you for reading The Nation!

Historical Amnesia About Slavery Is a Tool of White Supremacy Mychal Denzel Smith","The article “A Small Victory for Reproductive Rights” by Katha Pollitt discusses the Supreme Court case June Medical Services v. Russo and its significance in the ongoing battle over abortion rights in the U.S. The case involved a Louisiana law requiring abortion clinic doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, which could have led to the closure of most clinics in the state. Pro-choice advocates feared the law’s success would embolden anti-abortion measures nationwide.

The Supreme Court’s decision was seen as a surprising victory for abortion access. Chief Justice John Roberts, previously a supporter of similar restrictions, voted against the Louisiana law, citing the principle of respecting legal precedent, despite his personal opposition to abortion rights. This decision followed the Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt ruling from 2016, which struck down a similar law in Texas. Pollitt notes that Roberts’ ruling wasn’t an endorsement of abortion rights but a narrow adherence to precedent, and he may not oppose future abortion restrictions.

Pollitt cautions that this ruling should be seen as a temporary reprieve rather than a definitive victory. She expresses concern that complacency might diminish the urgency to protect abortion rights, especially with Donald Trump’s judicial appointments. The article highlights the broader context of diminishing abortion access in the U.S., particularly for poor and low-income women who face logistical and financial barriers to accessing care. The ongoing threat to Roe v. Wade and the possible further shift of the Supreme Court to the right under Trump’s influence makes it clear that the struggle for reproductive rights is far from over."
"Awaiting court action on 6-week ban, Georgia abortion clinics turn patients away ‚Äì WABE","Awaiting court action on 6-week ban, Georgia abortion clinics turn patients away WABE Keep WABE strong with your gift today! Donate Awaiting court action on 6-week ban, Georgia abortion clinics turn patients away Abortion Georgia General Assembly Health Women's Health Jess Mador WABE January 19th, 2023 Feminist Womens Health Center Operations Manager and security head Tracii Wesley prepares to greet patients outside the clinic. Jess MadorWABE The Georgia Supreme Court is preparing to take up a lawsuit challenging the states six-week abortion ban in March. After the law known as House Bill 481 took effect last fall, clinics that provide abortion have had to adjust to the restrictions. In this story, we spend time with some Atlanta abortion providers and patients caught at the center of Georgias battle over abortion access. In her tiny office at Feminist Womens Health Center in DeKalb County, Tracii Wesley sits at a computer. Today is a clinic day, a surgical abortion, medical, pill abortion day, she said. She pulls up the days patient schedule. The sun isnt even up yet. Im printing the list for today of how many patients we have. I bet they got at least 40 folks on here, if not more, said Wesley. This clinic provides abortion three days per week. Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest. Be advised. We have three on standby. The radio clipped to Wesleys yellow safety vest crackles with the voice of a security guard stationed outside the brick building in the parking lot. Security has advised me weve got three patients already waiting in the parking lot. So, Im going to head upstairs and start getting them up and getting them in, Wesley said. Security is Wesleys number-one concern. Shes a retired Gwinnett County police officer who served 24 years in the department. Before that, she served in the military for a decade. Her experience comes in handy working at the clinic because abortion days always attract a handful of anti-abortion protesters. Its always the same few people. The staff at the clinic are on a first-name basis with the protesters. They stand on the curb with a speaker as patient cars enter and leave the lot. Weve got to take the power of God into our own hands. And he has worked throughout the course of human history, a protester said. It never ends well for people that do this, and it wont end well for you if you continue where youre going. Trust Christ, maam. Wesley trains her security team to be vigilant, to watch for suspicious activity and keep protesters off the property and away from patients. The biggest thing is do not engage with them because theyre going to say things and are going to poke the bear, she said. Theyre going to try to get a response out of you. She stays mostly at the clinic entrance at the top of a small hill while security guards monitor the parking lot down below. A clipboard is always in hand. Good morning. Good morning. How are you all this morning? Do you have an appointment, she said to patients approaching the clinic. Can I see your ID, too? After Wesleys inital check-in outside, the patients go inside to fully register at the front desk. They do bloodwork. They do an ultrasound, she said. And its during the ultrasound, they find out how far along they actually are. How far along in their pregnancies. Georgias cutoff is about six weeks. Since the law has been in effect, front office supervisor Antoinette, who doesnt want to give her last name out of concern for her safety, said they turn away an average of five to seven patients every day. We cant care for people who are over six weeks. Most women dont know that theyre six weeks and or pregnant in the first place, she said. And sometimes patients arent aware of the law. Those who are too far along get counseling and information about abortion access in nearby states. The closest option is in Greenville, South Carolina. Others are in North Carolina, and Florida. A patient checks in for an abortion appointment at Feminist Womens Health Center in Atlanta. Jess MadorWABE Theres a lot of Kleenex that we go through every week, said Wesley. Usually by the time they come outside, if I see them with their white paper, I know they were turned away. Go ahead, the security guard said. Alright, I got room for two cars, four people, Wesley said. Every surgical abortion patient is required to come with a driver, who also picks them up after the procedure. What type of vehicle did you drive today? What color? This continues all day. Wesley checks in patients and their drivers one by one. The cars mostly have Georgia plates, but other states, too Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Ohio. And Mississippi. Thats where the next patient is from. To get to the clinic, she said she and her friend drove overnight to Georgia. So we had to leave like around 12, 1230, no later than 1 a.m. Mississippi enacted a so-called trigger law after the U.S. Supreme Court decision last summer overturning Roe v. Wade. Now, abortion is allowed only when a womans life is in danger or in cases of rape reported to law enforcement. The Mississippi patient said shes relieved she was able to travel to Atlanta for an abortion, but wishes she didnt have to. She said she worries for patients who are unable to make the trip out of state. I feel like it should be offered closer there because some people dont have a way to drive five hours or eight hours. You know, you just dont never know what somebodys situation is. Ive got room for two cars, four people, Wesley said, checking in more patients and drivers. Two cars, four people on their way up. Good copy. Ill be at the top of the hill. Wesley said she loves what she does at Feminist Womens Health Center. Its more than just a job for me. Im very passionate about what I do here, she said, because Im a woman, and it affects me like it affects everybody else. She said she tries to comfort abortion patients and make their visits a little easier. Wesley is quick to offer patients and drivers a kind word.

The ban prohibits abortions after six weeks, a point at which many women are unaware of their pregnancy. As a result, clinics are turning away an average of five to seven patients per day. These women are often directed to seek care in other states, such as South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida.

Tracii Wesley, the operations manager at the clinic, oversees daily procedures and patient interactions. Her role also involves managing security, as abortion clinics are frequent targets of protests from anti-abortion groups. Wesley’s background in law enforcement and the military helps her maintain a calm, safe environment for patients and staff, as protesters try to discourage women from seeking abortions.

The clinic serves patients from across Georgia and neighboring states, such as Mississippi, where stricter abortion laws have been enacted after the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Some patients travel long distances, facing logistical challenges and financial burdens. Wesley, deeply passionate about her work, offers emotional support to patients, reassuring them that their decision won’t define their futures.

The legal battle over the six-week ban continues, with the Georgia Supreme Court expected to hear arguments in the spring. The outcome could significantly impact access to abortion in Georgia and neighboring regions."

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Abortion 71 of Americans support abortion restrictions poll The poll found most Americans want the states to decide the abortion issue, in contrast to Roe v. Wade By Tyler O'Neil Fox News Published January 20, 2022 1015am EST Updated January 20, 2022 1016am EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Texas abortion law stands Supreme Court Alexandria Hoff describes the latest Supreme Court ruling on Texas' abortion law and the continuing legal challenges on 'Special Report.' The vast majority of Americans support restrictions on abortion, according to a new poll sponsored by the Knights of Columbus and conducted by Marist Poll. The poll also found that a majority of Americans want to return abortion restrictions to the states, in contrast to the central ruling of Roe v. Wade 1973. ""When it comes to the direction of government policy, there has been consistency and consensus in American public opinion on the issue of abortion over the decades,"" Dr. Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said in a press release on the results.""As we await a decision in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, our polling continues to show that over 60 of Americans reject the central holding of Roe v. Wade, and want to return the decision to the states or make abortion illegal,"" Knights of Columbus Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly said in the release. Dobbs v. Jackson centers on whether all pre-viability restrictions on elective abortion are unconstitutional. PRO-LIFE ADVOCATES RIP KAMALA HARRIS' PREDICTION THAT WOMEN WILL DIE IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED The Knights of Columbus-Marist poll does not just ask Americans whether or not they support Roe v. Wade or whether they identify as ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice,"" but rather presents in-depth questions about abortion issues, probing Americans' public policy opinions rather than identity markers. ""When asked about their actual opinion, 71 of Americans support real restrictions that are more pro-life than federal law and the laws of many states,"" Timothy Saccoccia, vice president at the Knights of Columbus, said on a press call regarding the poll. He noted that 54 of Americans identify as ""pro-choice,"" but this label does not translate to a support to unlimited abortion.The poll presented six options on abortion restrictions ""abortion should be available to a woman at any time she wants one during her entire pregnancy"" ""abortion should be allowed only during the first six months of a pregnancy"" ""abortion should be allowed only during the first three months of a pregnancy"" ""abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother"" ""abortion should be allowed only to save the life of the mother"" and ""abortion should never be permitted under any circumstance."" Most Americans 71 said that abortion should be restricted to the first three months of pregnancy 22 or in other limited circumstances such as rape and incest 28, to save the life of the mother 9 or not at all 12. Only 17 of Americans said abortion should be available during an entire pregnancy and 12 said it should be restricted to the first six months. Knights of ColumbusMarist poll on abortion restrictions Knights of ColumbusMarist PollEven almost half of Democrats 49 supported tight restrictions, with only 31 saying abortion should be available during all nine months of pregnancy. A vast majority of Republicans 93 supported tight restrictions on abortion, while only 1 said abortion should be available throughout all of pregnancy. Most Independents 70 also supported tight restrictions, while only 19 said abortion should be available throughout pregnancy. CHRISTIANS FROM DIFFERENT RACES, DENOMINATIONS AND PARTIES GATHER TO PRAY BEFORE SUPREME COURT ABORTION CASE Support for tight restrictions has remained consistent over time, with between 64 and 86 of Americans supporting restricting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy, cases of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the mother, or banning the practice entirely. Knights of ColumbusMarist poll on abortion restrictions Knights of ColumbusMarist PollThe poll also found that a plurality of Americans support banning abortion at the point in which the unborn baby can feel pain. ""If abortion remains legal in the United States including for cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, at which point should abortions for other reasons be limited?"" pollsters asked. Forty-two percent of Americans said abortion should be banned at ""the point at which a fetus can feel pain,"" while 36 said it should be banned at ""the point at which a fetus can live outside the womb,"" the position established in Roe v. Wade. Many Americans 11 said they are unsure on that question. NEW DEM GROUP AIMS TO PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF THE ABORTION INDUSTRYRather than just asking whether respondents support Roe v. Wade or want it overturned, Marist asked respondents what the Supreme Court should do when it considers the Roe v. Wade ruling.Although 36 of Americans said abortion should remain legal without restrictions, a position more in line with Roe, most Americans 61 would either have the court make abortion illegal 17 or have the issue determined by each state 44, both positions that would involve overturning Roe. A September Fox News poll found that 65 of Americans said they support Roe v. Wade when asked directly about the decision, not about the specific policy issues.

Market data provided by","A Knights of Columbus-sponsored poll by Marist reveals that 71% of Americans support restrictions on abortion, often favoring more limits than current federal and some state laws permit. Many Americans, regardless of political affiliation, support a restricted framework, such as limiting abortion to the first trimester (22%) or permitting it in cases like rape, incest, or where the mother’s life is endangered (28%). Only 17% support unrestricted abortion throughout a pregnancy.

The poll also found that 61% of Americans prefer either a state-controlled approach to abortion or an outright ban, signaling a divergence from the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established federal protections for abortion rights. This opinion is nuanced, with 42% supporting bans at the point a fetus can feel pain, and 36% advocating for restrictions based on viability outside the womb. While 65% support Roe when asked directly, there’s significant support for increased restrictions when discussing specific policies.

In general, the survey highlights a trend toward favoring state-level regulation, with Americans expressing a desire for tighter abortion controls than those currently mandated federally. Conducted among 1,004 adults, the survey results have a margin of error of about 3.3 percentage points."

Wade was overturned Published May 19, 2023 By Annalies Winny Drugs Family Planning Health Equity Reproductive and Sexual Health Its been almost a year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, dismantling the constitutional right to abortion more than 50 years after the case was decided. Now, the legal battleground of reproductive rights has grown even more tense. At least a dozen states have banned abortion entirely, and more states are seeking to further restrict access to abortionmaking the U.S. an outlier on the global stage Some 59 of the world's female population currently reside in a country where abortion is broadly allowed. And generally over the past several decades, there has been a trend toward increasing liberalization. So this is part of a very unique change in policy happening in the U.S., Suzanne Bell, PhD 18, MPH, said during a May 18 media briefing. During the briefing, Bell, an assistant professor in Population, Family and Reproductive Health at the Bloomberg School, and Joanne Rosen, JD, MA, a senior lecturer in Health Policy and Management, discussed the state of abortion access in the U.S. and the impact on womens healthand on physicianssince Roe was overturned. They outlined how abortion restrictions worsen health disparities, how states have responded to Roes dismantling, and the potential ramifications of litigation to restrict access to medication abortion for women across the country. How states have responded With federal protections for abortion overturned, states were empowered to regulate reproductive health. Rosen noted that some have passed legislation shoring up access to abortion. Fifteen states where abortion remains legal have enacted various additional protections, such as permitting the use of state funds to cover abortion costs allowing non-physician health professionals to perform abortions protecting physicians from prosecution, extradition, or other legal action by states that have banned abortion and prohibiting the disclosure of patients medical records without patient permission. Other states, however, have moved to further erode access, Rosen explained. Even before Dobbs was decided, abortion-hostile states enacted 108 abortion restrictionsin 2021 alone. This is the single highest number of abortion restrictions in any year since Roe was decided in 1973, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In the 11 months since Dobbs was decided, abortion has been banned in 14 states. Efforts to ban medication abortion nationwide A Texas case seeking to revoke the FDAs approval of the safe and effective drug mifepristonewhich was used in 53 of abortions in 2020has extraordinary implications that go beyond the possibility of taking mifepristone off the shelves, said Rosen. The litigation also sets a dangerous precedent for court interference in the FDAs scientific approval process. If the plaintiffs are successful, it would be the first time a court has abrogated the FDAs approval of a drug over the objections of the FDA, Rosen explained. The consequences could be far-reaching, potentially affecting access to any number of drugs for political or ideological reasons. Other efforts to abolish abortion center on reviving the Comstock Act, an 1873 law banning, among other things, the mailing or transport of products intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion. The Comstock Act is one of many zombie lawsmeaning theyve long been considered invalid but remain technically on the booksthat could see a revival given the precedent set by overturning Roe and invalidating Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that upheld the right to abortion. Other zombie laws in the same legal vein as Comstock, with the same potential for revival, concern same sex marriage and sexual activity and interracial marriage. Concerns for physicians The wave of abortion bans have broader implications for the health care workforce. For one, physicians working in states that ban abortion must contend with risk management committees set up by hospitals to determine whether an abortion is warranted in an urgent health care situation where the life of a pregnant person is at risk. In this context, physicians are finding it difficult to use best medical practices to protect their patients well-beingand theyre concerned about the genuine risk of criminal prosecution, Rosen said. In this environment, its getting harder for hospitals in abortion-hostile states to attract and retain obstetricians and gynecologists, and raising questions about the future of training for these specialties in those states. Are they going to entirely leave hostile states and set up their training program elsewhere? asked Bell. Or are the people that received training in those states just not going to receive the appropriate training? I think we have yet to see what those full ramifications are. Deepening disparities All of these challenges stand to exacerbate existing disparities in access to quality reproductive health care, Bell added. Black women are three times as likely, and Hispanic women twice as likely, to seek abortions than white women. And half of all women who get abortions live below the poverty linemany of them in states that limit or are seeking to limit abortions, explained Bell. Being denied an abortion comes with substantial health risksespecially for vulnerable groups. The risk of maternal death is 15 times higher for carrying a pregnancy to term than it is for abortion, and pregnancy-related complications are 2 to more than 25 times higher for pregnancies ending in birth compared to abortion, Bell explained. We have maternal mortality rates that are in some cases twice as high in restrictive states as they are in supportive abortion states, said Belland those restrictions undermine the delivery of basic services, Bell added. I want to emphasize that abortion is health care, Bell said. Recent state restrictions, coupled with ongoing efforts to curtail access to medication abortion pills nationwide, are an attempt to interfere with the delivery of evidence-based health care and control pregnant peoples bodies, with harmful consequences for individuals and population health.

Wade, which had protected abortion rights since 1973. Since then, a sharp increase in abortion restrictions has occurred across many states, with about 14 states enacting near-total abortion bans. This shift is unusual globally, as most nations have moved towards liberalizing abortion laws.

Suzanne Bell, PhD, and Joanne Rosen, JD, MA, experts from Johns Hopkins, discussed the consequences for women’s health, healthcare providers, and the broader implications for healthcare access. Bell and Rosen pointed out that restrictive abortion policies worsen health disparities, particularly for marginalized populations such as Black and Hispanic women, who are disproportionately affected by limited access. Many who seek abortions are economically disadvantaged, compounding the challenges they face in restrictive states. Studies show that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term carries a maternal death risk 15 times higher than abortion, especially impacting vulnerable groups.

A major legal battle is also unfolding over medication abortion, specifically mifepristone. A Texas lawsuit aiming to revoke its FDA approval could not only limit access to this medication—which accounted for over half of U.S. abortions in 2020—but also set a precedent for judicial interference in FDA processes. Additionally, outdated laws like the Comstock Act, an 1873 statute restricting abortion-related materials through the mail, are being considered for revival. This trend raises concerns about future restrictions on other rights, including same-sex and interracial marriage.

Physicians in restrictive states face new challenges: they must navigate complex legal restrictions that limit their ability to provide care and expose them to potential legal action. This restrictive environment is also straining healthcare systems, with hospitals in these states struggling to attract and retain obstetricians and gynecologists, which may impact training in these specialties.

Overall, the article highlights that the dismantling of Roe v. Wade has led to increased health risks, widened disparities in reproductive healthcare, and a legally precarious environment for healthcare providers. These trends underscore the ongoing political and legal tensions surrounding reproductive rights in the U.S."

Wade, which had protected abortion rights since 1973. This decision has led to a sharp increase in restrictive abortion laws, with approximately 14 states enacting near-total bans, contrasting with the global trend toward liberalizing abortion laws.

Experts Suzanne Bell and Joanne Rosen from Johns Hopkins highlight the negative impacts of these restrictions on women’s health and healthcare access, especially for marginalized groups such as Black and Hispanic women, who are disproportionately affected by these changes. Economically disadvantaged women face additional barriers, exacerbating the inequality in healthcare access. Research indicates that carrying an unwanted pregnancy carries a maternal death risk 15 times higher than having an abortion, a statistic that underscores the increased health risks for vulnerable populations in restrictive states.

Legal battles are underway over medication abortion, particularly concerning mifepristone, an FDA-approved drug used in over half of U.S. abortions as of 2020. A Texas lawsuit aiming to withdraw its FDA approval could set a concerning precedent for judicial control over FDA decisions. Furthermore, old statutes like the 1873 Comstock Act, which restricts mailing abortion-related materials, are being reconsidered, signaling potential challenges for other rights, including same-sex and interracial marriage.

Healthcare providers in states with strict abortion laws now face complex legal hurdles and potential legal risks, creating a challenging environment that hampers care. Hospitals in these states also struggle to recruit and retain obstetricians and gynecologists, potentially affecting medical training in these fields.

In summary, the reversal of Roe v. Wade has led to increased health risks, deeper health disparities, and a challenging legal climate for healthcare providers, reflecting ongoing political and legal tensions surrounding reproductive rights in the U.S."

Megan FowlerNovember 6, 2020 0147 PM Image Michael Ciaglo Getty Images Nancy Mace, representative-elect from South Carolina Pro-life legislators in the US House of Representatives made major gains on Tuesday with the election of 13 new pro-life women and the reelection of the Houses 11 incumbent pro-life women. With female pro-life candidates running in eight House races that have not been called, the pro-life presence could still grow. A record-breaking 107 women were elected to the House in 2020, surpassing the previous record of 102 set in 2019. Pro-life groups welcome the new representatives and the encouragement their presence will provide to their pro-life colleagues. Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Foundation, said men advocating for the rights of the unborn are sometimes dismissed because they dont deal with the direct effects of pregnancy the same way as women do. Bringing in more pro-life women will give encouragement and support to the leaders who have been speaking up for years, she said. All of the pro-life representatives elected this week are Republicans, and many say their position on abortion stems from their Christian faith. These gains are a repudiation of abortion extremism and further evidence that life is a winning issue in politics, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List in a statement celebrating the surge in pro-life women elected. Seven of the 13 new pro-life women flipped seats previously held by Democrats, including Nancy Mace who defeated incumbent Joe Cunningham in South Carolinas 1st Congressional District. Mace, a 42-year-old single mother of two, will now become the first Republican woman to represent the 1st Congressional District. Mace mentions among her positions that she believes the right to life is God-given. Diana Harshbarger, a pharmacist from Kingsport, Tennessee, won about 76 percent of the vote to serve Tennessees 1st Congressional District. She served as Sunday school teacher of 25 years, and according to her campaign website, derives her pro-life position from her faith. In one of her campaign ads, Harshbarger says, Jesus is Lord, and his light fills our lives, even through the chaos. Even as were attacked by our neighbor, his hand and our faith will guide us to salvation. Mary Miller, the new representative for Illinoiss 15th Congressional District, said, My family and my faith in God always come first. She has served as a Sunday school teacher and Vacation Bible School volunteer, and she attends Oakland Christian Church in Oakland, Illinois.Florida representative-elect Kat Cammack, who will become the youngest Republican woman in the House at age 32, gained the support of Baptists, Methodists, Mormons, and Catholics in her district when she launched a Faith and Pro-Life Coalition. As a young, millennial, pro-life woman, I have the unique opportunity to engage with my generation and those younger on the importance of fighting for the unborn, she said. With Democrats maintaining control of the House, Tobias said it was unlikely the pro-life representatives could advance any legislation restricting abortion, but she is thrilled to see more leaders opposed to abortion coming to the Capitol. In the US Senate, three pro-life women won reelection Wyomings Cynthia Lummis, Iowas Joni Ernst, and West Virginias Shelley Moore Capito. Georgias Kelly Loeffler advanced to a runoff in January.

Search","In November 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives saw a notable increase in pro-life women from the Republican Party, with 13 new pro-life women elected and 11 incumbent pro-life women reelected. This brought the number of women in Congress to a record-breaking 107, surpassing previous records. Seven of these new representatives flipped Democratic-held seats, signaling a significant gain for the pro-life movement within the Republican Party. These elected women often attribute their stance on abortion to their Christian faith, viewing their pro-life position as a reflection of their religious beliefs. Key figures include Nancy Mace, who became the first Republican woman to represent South Carolina’s 1st District, and Diana Harshbarger of Tennessee, who has served as a Sunday school teacher and is known for her faith-driven pro-life advocacy.

Despite the increased representation, the likelihood of passing pro-life legislation remains low due to the Democratic majority in the House. Nonetheless, pro-life leaders view this growth as a moral victory and a sign of growing support for their cause. Notably, this surge underscores the broader trend within the GOP of faith-based advocacy influencing political stances on abortion, as evidenced by campaigns that explicitly incorporate religious messaging. This development is celebrated by pro-life organizations, which see the election of these women as a response to what they perceive as “abortion extremism” in U.S. politics."

Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court six months ago.The decision to reverse Roe, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion care, means states now choose how much access residents have to abortion.Some states either had so-called trigger laws go into effect or laws that pre-dated Roe that were enforced following the court's decision.Meanwhile, some other states enacted laws that strengthened abortion rights or rejected ballot initiatives that would have further restricted access to the procedure. And then there were states did neither.""Both those legal changes happened, and we went to this patchwork,"" Katie Watson, an associate professor of medical social sciences, medical education, and obstetrics gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told ABC News.

Wade, multiple states adopted protections for and committed funding to abortion access.States including California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Oregon committed over 250 million collectively to abortion funding over the past year, according to Guttmacher.Other efforts to protect abortion access included new laws to improve abortion access in four states -- Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York -- to increase security for providers and patients accessing abortion care.According to Guttmacher, 14 states adopted so-called shield laws designed to shield people who travel across states lines to receive an abortion and the providers who care for those patients. This means they can't be charged for receiving an abortion out-of-state.Voters go to the polls to vote on abortion accessThe fall of Roe v. Wade raised the stakes for the 2022 midterm election in November, as multiple states had abortion-related questions on the ballot.Kansas voters decisively rejected a bid to remove abortion protections from its state constitution.The vote came after the state's Supreme Court decided in 2019 that the Kansas constitution establishes a fundamental right to abortion.Anti-abortion activists celebrate, June 24, 2022, in Washington, after the Supreme Court ended constitutional protections for abortion.Steve HelberAP, FILEThe Kansas vote was the first state-level test after the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v.

Although it is currently legal in Vermont at any stage of pregnancy, the state's constitution did not grant explicit protections for the right to abortion prior to the acceptance of the amendment.Michigan voters meanwhile approved a constitutional amendment that would add protections for reproductive rights. The amendment defines reproductive freedom as ""the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management and infertility care.""A state abortion ban on the books in Michigan since 1931 is being challenged in state courts, but a state judge ruled in September that the ban is unconstitutional, barring its enforcement by the state's attorney general and state prosecutors.In Kentucky, voters rejected an amendment to the state's constitution that specified the right to abortion does not exist, nor is the government required to allocate funding for abortion.Abortion is currently banned in the state after a trigger law went into effect when Roe was overturned. Arguments against the ban will soon be heard in the Kentucky Supreme Court, something the amendment would have prevented.Montana voters rejected a proposal to change the state constitution to define all fetuses ""born alive"" as legal persons, including those born after an attempted abortion. The proposal would have granted any fetus born alive the right to appropriate and reasonable medical care and treatment.Montana state courts have blocked three abortion bans passed last year from going into effect while litigation continues.Patients travel further to seek abortion careDr. Beverly Gray, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina, told ABC News that ever since Roe was overturned, there has been an increase in patients, both locally and from out-of-state.""With Florida having a 15-week ban, Georgia and Tennessee having fairly strict bans, and then South Carolina kind of going back and forth with bans, patients ended up coming to North Carolina for care,"" she said. ""We're seeing a handful of patients almost every day in clinic that are traveling for care.""""I think it's really scary for patients who might find themselves in a situation that they weren't expecting and needing care and their providers may not be able to provide evidence-based care because of laws that are now in place,"" she continued.An operating room is seen at the private clinic Dator, which provides abortions, in Madrid, Spain, May 23, 2022.

North Carolina has a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed and providers are required to read a mandatory counseling script from the state, which includes information about public and private services available during pregnancy and possible adverse effects of abortion and pregnancy.Critics say the script is a fear tactic to shame and scare people out of having abortions.""So, there's a lot of . logistics and requirements that have to be in place before people can get here, so it requires a lot of coordination,"" Gray said. ""We have someone who pretty much deals with . phone calls and logistics most day, every day that we're in clinic.""Clinics closing down or moving across state linesFollowing the Supreme Court's decision, several abortion clinics were forced to either shut down or move their practices out of state.The Red River Women's Clinic moved from Fargo, North Dakota, to Moorhead, Minnesota -- a mile-and-a-half away -- after Roe's overturn due to the legal battles currently being waged in North Dakota, although abortion is still legal in the state.Since opening on Aug.10, Tammi Kromenaker, director of RRWC, told ABC News it was bittersweet to move but they've found a rhythm.""We're providing care to patients in North Dakota, South Dakota, northwestern Minnesota we have had a couple of gals from Texas come, like two,"" she said.

""Literally just being five minutes away, it's the same community, but it's such a stark contrast between the two states.""Although Kromenaker and her colleagues are currently fighting legal battles in the state to prevent abortion bans from going into effect, she said she's not sure if the clinic would ever move back or if she would open a second clinic in the Peace Garden State.""There are so many onerous restrictions on providers in North Dakota, that unless or until those are taken away -- I mean, we had to tell patients 24 hours ahead of time, 'Abortion terminates the life of a whole separate unique living human being.'

Wade, abortion access across the U.S. became a patchwork of state laws, dramatically changing the landscape of reproductive healthcare. This decision removed the federal right to abortion, leaving states to set their own policies, leading to wide variations in access.

Key Changes in State Laws

	•	Total Abortion Bans: At least 14 states, including Alabama, Texas, and West Virginia, implemented near-total abortion bans. Some, like Wisconsin, halted services due to legal uncertainties, while states like Georgia adopted strict gestational limits (e.g., six-week bans).
	•	Restrictive Measures in Other States: States such as Florida and Arizona introduced gestational limits (15 weeks), though Arizona’s enforcement was delayed pending legal reviews.
	•	Ongoing Legal Challenges: In Indiana, North Dakota, and others, recently passed abortion bans remain blocked as legal battles continue.

States Expanding or Protecting Access

In response, over a dozen states, including California, New Jersey, and Oregon, committed substantial funding (over $250 million collectively) to support abortion access. Several states enacted “shield laws” to protect providers and patients who travel across state lines for abortion services, ensuring legal protection from prosecution.

Ballot Initiatives and Public Voting on Abortion Rights

The overturning of Roe influenced key decisions in the 2022 midterms:
	•	States Upholding Abortion Rights: Kansas voters chose to keep abortion protections, reinforcing a 2019 state ruling. Voters in California, Vermont, and Michigan passed constitutional amendments to safeguard reproductive rights.
	•	Anti-Abortion Ballot Rejections: Kentucky and Montana voters rejected amendments aimed at limiting abortion or defining fetuses as legal persons. These rejections indicated some resistance to tightening restrictions in states with significant opposition.

Impact on Patients and Healthcare Providers

The restricted access has forced many patients to travel long distances for care. Providers, like Dr. Beverly Gray in North Carolina, have seen a rise in out-of-state patients due to stringent laws in nearby states. Logistical challenges, including mandatory waiting periods and state-mandated counseling, complicate care, requiring extensive coordination.

Clinic Closures and Relocations

Several clinics have relocated across state lines. For example, the Red River Women’s Clinic moved from North Dakota to Minnesota, where it faces fewer restrictions. Clinic director Tammi Kromenaker expressed relief at the reduced administrative burdens in Minnesota compared to North Dakota, though ongoing legal battles may continue to impact abortion access in the region.

The evolving abortion landscape in the U.S. now largely depends on state-level politics, legal actions, and voter decisions, creating a complex and continually shifting environment for reproductive healthcare."

DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE 430 South Capitol Street Southeast Washington, DC 20003 Proudly Powered by WordPress Democrats FACT SHEET Trumps Anti-Women Record July 27, 2020 facebook twitter email Trump has an abysmal record on issues important to women using the last three and a half years to undermine access to health care, child care, and paid leave. Trump created barriers to full equality and rolled back workplace protections against discrimination and sexual harrassment. Under Trump, it is increasingly difficult for women to succeed in the workplace, at school, and at home. Trump has blocked womens access to health care through legislation, regulations, judicial appointments, and legal action. In 2016, Trump called for an abortion ban with some form of punishment for women which was too extreme even for many anti-abortion activists. Trump tried to limit access to reproductive health care by supporting legislation that would institute a restrictive 20-week abortion ban and block insurance plans that cover abortions. Trump slashed funding for family planning programs and health care providers that provide abortion services or referrals. Trump issued a regulation allowing employers to refuse to provide no-cost contraception coverage as previously required under the Affordable Care Act. After promising to automatically overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump has packed the Supreme Court and circuit courts with extremist opponents of abortion rights. Trump is fighting to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which could allow insurers to charge women more and not cover maternity care. Trump chose the anti-abortion extremist Mike Pence as his running mate and Betsy DeVos, who compared the choice to have an abortion to the choice to own slaves, as his secretary of education. As president he has aggressively touted his anti-abortion agenda, and the president of the Susan B. Anthony List called Trump the most pro-life president in our nations history. Trump revoked protections against sexual harassment, sexual assault, and discrimination at work and school. During the 2016 campaign, Trump said women would make the same as men if they do as good a job. Trump revoked protections against workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault, discrimination, and pay disparities. Trump rescinded Obama-era campus sexual assault guidelines, which required colleges to take allegations more seriously and hold perpetrators accountable, and narrowed the definition of sexual harassment. Trump has failed to reduce the cost of childcare and made little progress on paid family leave. Trump has defended employers who pay mothers less than men and called pregnancy an inconvenience for employers, so its not surprising he has failed to follow through on his promise to solve childcare. Trumps tax scam reduced the value of the childcare credit for low- and moderate-income families even as it gave huge tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest 1. In the midst of a pandemic in which women are disproportionately losing their jobs, Trump scaled back paid leave requirements, leaving 75 of workers at risk of not receiving paid leave for childcare. Trump touted an insufficient paid family leave proposal that does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.","The Democratic National Committee’s fact sheet critiques Donald Trump’s record on policies affecting women, citing actions over his presidency that allegedly restricted women’s healthcare, limited workplace equality, and reduced support for families. Key points include:
	1.	Healthcare and Reproductive Rights: Trump took multiple steps that impacted access to reproductive health services and women’s healthcare in general. He supported restrictive abortion legislation, limited insurance coverage for abortions, and cut funding to providers offering abortion-related services. Additionally, he allowed employers to refuse no-cost contraception coverage and appointed judges opposed to abortion rights. His efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) raised concerns about increasing healthcare costs for women and reducing coverage for maternity care.
	2.	Workplace Protections and Equality: The Trump administration rolled back protections against workplace discrimination, sexual harassment, and pay inequality. Trump rescinded Obama-era campus sexual assault guidelines, which previously required stricter handling of assault allegations, and narrowed the scope of what constitutes sexual harassment. His comment that women should earn the same as men “if they do as good a job” and his defense of employers paying mothers less reflect a perceived lack of commitment to wage equality.
	3.	Childcare and Paid Family Leave: Despite promises to address childcare affordability and family leave, Trump reportedly failed to make substantial progress. His administration’s tax policy reduced childcare credits for low- and moderate-income families, while benefiting corporations and high-income earners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump scaled back paid leave protections, leaving many without support for childcare needs. His proposal for family leave fell short of typical paid family leave standards.

The DNC contends that Trump’s policies have disproportionately affected women, limiting their access to necessary resources and creating additional barriers to equality in healthcare, workplaces, and family life."

The out-of-date laws mean that it's illegal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland even when a woman is pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or when the foetus has no chance of living. Any medical professionals carrying out abortions face a life sentence in prison. Northern Ireland urgently needs to bring its laws in line with human rights, before more women and girls suffer. Law violates human rights Sarah Ewarts first pregnancy was given a fatal foetal diagnosis and she had to travel to England to terminate her pregnancy as it was illegal at home, turning her life into a living nightmare. Together with Sarah and Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission we took her case to the Belfast High Court and today it ruled that laws governing abortion in Northern Ireland are in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This is welcome news, but its shameful that the Courts have had to step in because politicians have repeatedly failed Northern Irelands women. 'I hope that todays ruling means that I, and other women like me, will no longer have to go through the pain I experienced, of having to travel to England, away from the care of the doctors and midwife who knew me, to access the healthcare I needed. 'I, and many women like me have been failed by our politicians. First, they left me with no option but to go to England for medical care. Then, by their refusal to change the law, they left me with no option but to go to the courts on my and other women's behalf.' Sarah Ewart This decision is a hugely significant step towards ensuring the right to access abortion for women and girls in Northern Ireland who have been raped, are victims of incest or whose pregnancies have been given a fatal foetal diagnosis. Northern Irelands laws on abortion date back to the nineteenth century and carry the harshest criminal penalties in Europe. Judge Mr Justice Mark Horner told Belfast High Court that womens human rights were being breached by current laws. 'In the circumstances, given this issue is unlikely to be grasped by the legislature in the foreseeable future, and the entitlement of citizens of Northern Ireland to have their Convention rights protected by the courts, I conclude that the Article Eight rights of women in Northern Ireland who are pregnant with fatal foetal abnormalities or who are pregnant as a result of sexual crime are breached by the impugned provisions.' Judge Mr Justice Mark Horner Northern Irelands abortion laws must be brought into the twenty-first century and into line with international law as a matter of urgency.

Amnesty International UK 2023","A recent ruling in Belfast High Court declared Northern Ireland’s abortion laws in violation of human rights, specifically breaching Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This decision stems from the case of Sarah Ewart, who, after receiving a fatal fetal diagnosis during her first pregnancy, was forced to travel to England for an abortion due to the strict abortion laws in Northern Ireland. These laws, among the most punitive in Europe, prohibit abortion even in cases of rape, incest, or fatal fetal abnormality and threaten medical providers who perform abortions with life imprisonment.

The judgment, issued by Judge Mr. Justice Mark Horner, criticized the failure of Northern Irish lawmakers to modernize abortion laws, which date back to the 19th century. Horner affirmed that the current laws violate the rights of women who face severe pregnancy circumstances and emphasized the judiciary’s responsibility to protect these rights in the absence of legislative action. Ewart expressed hope that this ruling would prevent others from enduring the trauma she faced, which included leaving her home and medical support system to access necessary care.

Amnesty International UK supports this ruling and urges immediate reform, highlighting the need for Northern Ireland’s abortion laws to align with international human rights standards and offer compassionate, lawful options for women in distressing situations."

Connecticut's March for Life in Hartford attended by several thousand people, including the Sisters of Life. photo Tom Wehner National Catholic Register Erika J. Ahern March 24, 2022 HARTFORD As the nation awaits the Supreme Courts ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health, a decision that could overturn Roe v. Wade and send abortion legislation back to the states, organizers of the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., have renewed their efforts to support state-level marches and activism. On Wednesday, Connecticut saw its first March for Life held on the steps of the State Capitol in Hartford. Organizers estimated there were about 3,000 marchers. Among the speakers were Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Archbishop Leonard Blair of Hartford evangelical archbishop Leroy Bailey, senior pastor at The First Cathedral in Bloomfield Sister of Life Mariae Agnus Dei Christopher Healy, executive director of the Connecticut Catholic Conference Peter Wolfgang, executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut Lisa Maloney, president of the Connecticut Pregnancy Care Center Coalition, Christina Bennett of Live Action and State Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect. Archbishop Blair told the Register as he prepared to march with the throng through the streets of downtown Hartford With the prospect that the battle against abortion will go to the state level, we need to focus our efforts all the more at the local level. I am gratified to see so many people here today and thankful for the chance to publicly stand up for life. Connecticut has historically been one of the nations most aggressively pro-abortion states, and pro-life advocates have struggled to make any meaningful changes to the law. But their voices were heard this week. Mancini spoke with the Register at the Capitol. Connecticut is a hostile environment to life. And Ive witnessed personally that when we can rally the grassroots in any state, but especially in a hostile environment, it can have such power, not just in the people themselves, so they feel theyre not alone, but more importantly in the beautiful things that happen when people come together. She emphasized that, with the Dobbs decision on the horizon, for the first time, in my lifetime, we have the possibility of the question of abortion returning to the state legislative branches. LISTEN ""This is a spiritual battle at its highest level."" jeannemfl tells TomWehner today at Connecticut's MarchforLife WhyWeMarch CTMarchForLife NCRegister LoveWins pic.twitter.comfDyaeb7HLf National Catholic Register NCRegister March 23, 2022 So it is all the more important that we're here today in Connecticut, she continued, because then it will be the legislators in Connecticut deciding the laws and whether life is protected or not. And every voice matters in Connecticut. You must let your legislators know where you stand. She thanked the Catholic Church for its firm commitment to the unborn and human dignity at all stages of life, in particular commending the support of Archbishop Blair. This is the most preeminent issue in terms of social justice and human rights, and its beautiful to see the Church preach about it from the pulpit. We have that a lot in my home Diocese of Arlington. I know not everyone has that, but you certainly have that here. Prayer First The night before the march, St. Marys Church in New Haven hosted a Mass for Life and reception featuring Mancini. Archbishop Blair celebrated the Mass in the recently renovated church that houses the tomb of Blessed Michael McGivney, founder of the Knights of Columbus. About 250 faithful attended, including Supreme Knight Patrick Kelly and his wife, Vanessa, members of the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus, whose headquarters are in New Haven, members of the Sisters of Life, parishioners and pro-life leaders from throughout the state. Spiritual Battle Parishioner Lori Myers noted the central role of prayer in particular the sacrifice of the Mass for Catholics in the pro-life movement and the March for Lifes efforts to support grassroots initiatives at the state level. As a Catholic, the right to life from conception to natural death is front and center of our beliefs. Because there is so much spiritual warfare associated with this cause, its vital we as a Catholic community come together to pray on the eve of such a momentous and historical occasion as the March for Life in Hartford tomorrow. Father Ryan Lerner, pastor of St. Marys parish, told the Register, Its very special to me that St. Marys has been chosen to host this years archdiocesan Mass for Life and reception. Our parish is home to a tremendous number of families. Seeing so many children each weekend is a reminder of the sacredness of all human life, from conception until natural death. Father Lerner added, We are also excited to participate in the local March for Life in Hartford witnessing in the public square alongside so many others who are working to transform our culture into one shaped by the gospel of life. Culture of Deaths Mercilessness In his homily, Archbishop Blair noted Connecticuts reputation as a state where anti-life legislation has contributed to a prevalent culture of death. We find ourselves in a cloud of darkness and death, he said, but the bright light of Gods joy and mercy is always with us. Archbishop Blair described the prevalence of abortion in American society as a sign of mercilessness. He emphasized that Catholics believe life from conception until natural death is sacred to God, the author of life, and that, in the end, all will be accountable to him. In the face of the evil of abortion, he said, the faithful feel the righteous indignation of the Old and New Testament prophets, and Jesus himself promised harsh judgment to the unrepentant. In the face of mercilessness, the archbishop called on the faithful to remember that faith in Jesus is faith in the Redeemer whose heart is an ocean of mercy for even the worst of sinners. He urged the faithful to pray for both an end to abortion and the conversion of abortionists and their supporters. Let us never lose faith in the perfect justice and the perfect mercy of God, he concluded. The End of Roe? Following the Mass, the parish hosted a reception in the church hall featuring remarks by Supreme Knight Kelly and the March for Lifes Mancini. Kelly welcomed Mancini, Archbishop Blair and the Sisters of Life, thanking the sisters in particular for the joy they radiate through their service to the Church. He emphasized, too, that with the possibility of the Dobbs v. Jackson case bringing an end to Roe v. Wade this coming June, state marches will become center stage, particularly in states like Connecticut, which has enshrined abortion in its state constitution. Mancini commended the Knights in her talk, saying, The March for Life would not exist if not for the Knights of Columbus. They are the backbone of the pro-life movement in the United States. Mancini listed a myriad of initiatives supported by the Knights, including the Special Olympics, the Ukraine Solidarity Fund, the Sisters of Life, and the March for Life itself. The March for Life is wholly committed to grassroots advocacy in state legislatures, she said We are at a cultural crossroads in terms of the legality of abortion. If Dobbs overturns Roe, the question of abortion will return to the legislative branches of the states. State marches, such as the Connecticut March for Life, are vital to the pro-life strategy in combating the culture of death nationally, she underscored. Mancini also noted that the national march has historically been held on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade in January. Temperatures in 2022 were well below freezing with the wind chill, and she confessed she was looking forward to better marching weather in the local state marches. In 2022, the March for Lifes state march program will hold five state marches Connecticut, Virginia, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. In 2023, that number will double to 10, then doubling again each year until all 50 states have an annual March for Life in their capital cities. Keywords march for life connecticut abortion Erika J.

Sign Up","The March for Life recently held Connecticut’s first state-level march in Hartford, drawing around 3,000 participants to advocate for pro-life legislation, especially as the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling might soon overturn Roe v. Wade, returning abortion decisions to individual states. Led by Jeanne Mancini, President of the March for Life, the rally featured speeches by religious leaders and pro-life advocates who underscored the importance of grassroots activism in Connecticut, a traditionally pro-abortion state. Mancini emphasized that in a challenging environment like Connecticut, visible community support can empower individuals and influence lawmakers as state legislatures could soon gain more control over abortion laws.

The event was anchored by a strong Catholic presence, including Archbishop Leonard Blair of Hartford, who stressed the spiritual dimension of the pro-life cause and encouraged the faithful to engage through prayer and public witness. The previous evening, St. Mary’s Church in New Haven hosted a Mass for Life attended by several hundred parishioners, Knights of Columbus leaders, and local pro-life advocates, with Archbishop Blair highlighting the role of faith and mercy in opposing what he described as a “culture of death.”

At the march, Archbishop Blair and other speakers urged attendees to continue advocating at the state level, should Roe be overturned, with Mancini also commending the Knights of Columbus for their support in the pro-life movement. The March for Life plans to expand its state marches in response to the anticipated shift in abortion legislation, aiming to hold annual marches in all 50 states within the coming years."

The Republican senators sudden surge to fight for reproductive rights has nothing to do with actual bodily autonomy for all people, but instead for a select few cisgender menIn a tweet on Sunday, Cruz criticized a recent legislation out of Alabama that would threaten the reproductive rights of men. The legislation, formally called HB 238, proposes mandatory vasectomy procedures for men over 50-years-old living in the state and was filed in the state legislature by Rolanda Hollis last Thursday. After learning about the bill, Cruz tweeted, ""Yikes. A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything.literally! Alabama Democrat proposes bill mandating all men have vasectomy at age 50 or after third child.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTYikes. A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything.literally! Alabama Democrat proposes bill mandating all men have vasectomy at age 50 or after third child. Ted Cruz tedcruz February 16, 2020 If the bill passes, it would require that all men over 50 undergo a vasectomy within one month after their 50th birthday or immediately following the birth of their third biological child. This same state is already facing backlash for regulations on reproductive rights for women. Alabama already banned abortions at any stage of pregnancy, no matter how early, and with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Now, this latest reproductive rights legislation was proposed as a response to the law passed banning abortions in the state, and Cruz is actually in opposition of it.Cruz never fought the ongoing attacks on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights for people who can get pregnant in Alabama, nor has he criticized any other legislation stripping people of reproductive rights. Why is that? Cruzs opposition to reproductive rights has long been a part of his platforms and policies. Ted Cruz is infamous for being an anti-abortion politician and has constantly lobbied against reproductive rights. The Republican senator has taken many anti-abortion and anti-reproductive rights positions, including supporting bills that ban abortion and being outspoken about being anti-choice and the ""dangers"" of Planned Parenthood. In fact, Cruz has been one of the leaders in trying to condemn the Democratic party for attempting to protect access to abortion. Hes called abortion access laws a real war on women. In response to his tweet, people online dished the same heat back to him, calling him a hypocrite for favoring one form of bodily autonomy over another and only for cisgender men. Some people asked him why he suddenly doesnt like the government trying to control a persons body when hes never seemed to have an issue with it before, while others offered up some snarky perfection about autonomy and choice. Cruz surely thought he was being clever and tweeting a more popular opinion, but according to his mentions, the senators hypocrisy has him cruzin for a bruisin.

The bill, introduced by Democrat Rolanda Hollis, was meant as a symbolic response to Alabama’s restrictive abortion laws, which severely limit reproductive options for women without exceptions for rape or incest.

Cruz’s reaction on Twitter emphasized the dangers of government overreach into personal freedoms, stating, “A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything.” His criticism sparked controversy, as many saw his stance as hypocritical, given his history of anti-abortion and anti-reproductive rights positions. Despite consistently supporting policies that restrict reproductive rights for women, Cruz opposed this law, revealing a selective approach to bodily autonomy that many found contradictory. Critics on social media highlighted Cruz’s apparent double standard, noting his opposition to women’s reproductive rights while advocating for men’s autonomy in this instance.

The incident has reignited discussions around political biases in reproductive rights and autonomy, showcasing the polarized perspectives within U.S. politics on these issues."

The 54 decision in June Medical Services v. Russo was a significant victory for Travis TJ Tu 03, senior counsel for US litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights. He briefed the case that Julie Rikelman, the centers litigation director, argued in March on behalf of a clinic that challenged the law. The requirement would have forced the shutdown of two abortion clinics in Louisiana, leaving just one abortion provider in the state. Travis Tu '03Its a case out of Louisiana that would effectively put abortion out of reach for almost all women in the state, said Tu before the oral argument. So its a life or death case for the clients in Louisiana that also has potentially huge reverberations for the country at large. The Louisiana law was similar to a Texas law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016 at stake in June Medical Services v. Russo was whether abortion providers who challenge restrictions on their practice have standing to advocate for the rights of their patients as well. This kind of work is what Tu had envisioned as a law student with his heart set on public service. Prior to enrolling at NYU Law, he worked for the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania, lobbying for issues including LGBTQ rights, reproductive rights, and support for needle exchange programs. He later joined Lambda Legal as a legal assistant turned public communications coordinator, educating the public on issues related to LGBTQ rights. In the course of doing that work, I had met a lot of brilliant lawyers who were making a lot of positive change in the world, and I wanted to be those people, Tu says. When he was considering law schools, Tu says that he was energized by his experience at NYU Laws events for prospective students, and being accepted into the Root-Tilden-Kern program solidified his decision to attend the Law School. He served as editor-in-chief of the NYU Law Review, and recalls being particularly interested in courses that provided insight into the courtroom, including Civil Procedure with Helen Hershkoff and Evidence with Burt Neuborne. Those courses offered lessons that truly sank in once he was a practicing lawyer, he says. As a student speaker at Law School convocation, he talked about the legal challenges that he and his peers would be called to address in politically divisive, post-911 world. When things go badly in our nation, people will look to lawyers to help sort everything out, Tu said to his classmates. After graduating, Tu clerked for Sonia Sotomayor, now a U.S. Supreme Court justice, when she was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He joined Patterson Belknap Webb Tyler as an associate and became a litigation partner in 2012. During his time at the firm, Tus practice centered on false advertising, consumer fraud, and unfair competition cases. He also was active in pro bono and public interest matters, representing amicus curae in two landmark same-sex marriage cases in the Supreme Court the American Bar Association United States v. Windsor, and a coalition of elected officers in Obergefell v. Hodges. Tu also served as co-chair of the firms Diversity Committee. More recently, in response to what he described as an unsettling political atmosphere nationally, Tu decided that the next step in his career would be in public service, defending civil rights. Crossing paths with Nancy Northup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, whom he had first met as a law student, Tu found the organizations efforts compelling. When I spoke to her and realized what the center was facing in terms of the onslaught of anti-abortion restrictions that were coming, and certainly the changed Court I said, This is the right place and the right time, Tu says. He joined the center in 2018. In February, as Tu and Rikelman prepared for their Supreme Court appearance, they fine-tuned their arguments through moot sessions at various law schools, including an argument at NYU Law on February 3. That moot session was coordinated by NYU Law adjunct professor Yaira Dubin, counsel at OMelveny Meyers, who is also co-counsel for the plaintiffs in June Medical Services v. Russo. One week after the Supreme Court argument, Tu returned to NYU Law to join Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law Melissa Murray for a panel discussion on the case that was hosted by the American Constitution Society at NYU Law, IfWhenHow Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, and the Supreme Court Forum.

Tel. 212 998-6100","Travis Tu (‘03), a senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, represented a Louisiana abortion clinic in the landmark case June Medical Services v. Russo, which was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020. The case challenged a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. The law would have effectively shut down two of the state’s three clinics, severely restricting access to abortion. The Court ruled in a 5-4 decision to strike down the law, marking a significant victory for Tu and the clinic involved.

Tu had long been committed to public service, a path that began during his time at NYU School of Law. Before joining the Center for Reproductive Rights in 2018, he worked on LGBTQ and reproductive rights issues with the ACLU and Lambda Legal. At NYU, he was an editor of the NYU Law Review and excelled in courses on Civil Procedure and Evidence, which later proved invaluable in his legal career.

After clerking for Justice Sonia Sotomayor and working as a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, Tu shifted to public service due to his concerns about the political climate. His career includes key pro bono work, including involvement in landmark same-sex marriage cases like United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges.

Leading up to the June Medical Services case, Tu and his colleagues participated in moot courts at law schools, including one at NYU Law. Following the Supreme Court arguments, Tu returned to NYU for a panel discussion on the case. The case was crucial not only for Louisiana’s access to abortion but also for national reproductive rights, especially as anti-abortion laws were becoming more prevalent across the U.S."

From humans to hens, were all made of flesh and blood, desire freedom, love our families, and value our lives, says PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. PETA is asking the Association for Womens Rights in Development to be an ally across species by rejecting foods that are the product of female subjugation and abuse. PETAwhose motto reads, in part, that animals are not ours to eatpoints out that sexual exploitation is rampant in the meat, egg, and dairy industries because of speciesism, the human-supremacist mentality that all other animal species are inferior to our own. Pigs and cows endure continuous artificial insemination, and once their reproductive systems wear out, theyre sent to slaughteras are the hens who live packed on top of each other on filthy egg farms. For more information, visit PETA.org. PETAs letter to the Association for Womens Rights in Development follows. Nidhi Goyal President Association for Womens Rights in Development Dear Ms. Goyal, Greetings from PETA and our 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide. We appreciate your efforts to empower women and challenge inequality. May we appeal to you to adopt a policy to serve only vegan meals at your events? I will respectfully make the case below that this fits with your mission very well. The issue involves sexual exploitation, sisterhood, environmental concerns, and more. A growing number of human rights and environmental rights groupsincluding the Center for Biological Diversity, the Food Empowerment Project, Sea Shepherd, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the National Lawyers Guildhave pledged to serve only vegan meals during their events. The Golden Globe Awards, the Critics Choice Awards, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards have all opted to serve only vegan food. Im sure you know that continuing to eat animals and their products has a terrible environmental impact, in addition to being indefensibly cruel. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock production for meat, eggs, and milk is the leading cause of ocean dead zones, water pollution, species extinction, and habitat destructionproblems that affect us all. As Gloria Steinem has said, Imagine we are linked, not ranked. She also wrote, The first problem for all of us, men and women, is not to learn, but to unlearn. All supremacy is learned, and it is up to all of us to unlearn oppressive behavior and ideologies, including speciesism. When one thinks about it honestly, every femalewhether she has fur, fins, feathers, or hairfeels pain and fear and deserves to live her life free from suffering. Sexual exploitation is rampant in the meat, egg, and dairy industries. Farmed animalsespecially femalesare subjugated, oppressed, and abused, and their reproductive systems are regulated and controlled. Female cows, pigs, and turkeys are routinely and repeatedly rapedthere is no other word for itthroughout their brief, miserable lives, and their babies are taken from them, sometimes immediately after birth, to be exploited and eventually killed. We hope youll agree that violence against females is always wrong, regardless of species. Wed be happy to help your staff plan delicious and healthy vegan meals for your events and to offer assistance in any other way. I look forward to hearing back from you.

PETA argues that this approach supports the cause of equality for all females, including animals, by rejecting foods derived from the exploitation of female animals in the meat, egg, and dairy industries.

PETA highlights the sexual exploitation of female animals in these industries, where they are subjected to artificial insemination and reproductive control, and their babies are taken from them for exploitation or slaughter. PETA compares this treatment to the oppression of women, stating that violence against females is wrong, regardless of species. PETA also draws attention to the environmental impact of animal agriculture, linking it to issues such as water pollution, habitat destruction, and species extinction.

The organization points out that several other human rights and environmental groups, including the Golden Globe Awards and the Critics Choice Awards, have already adopted vegan meal policies. PETA offers assistance in planning vegan meals for AWID events and urges them to take a stand for female animals, making the connection between the fight for human rights and animal rights.

The letter concludes with a call to action for AWID to serve as an ally across species, rejecting animal-based foods and furthering its mission of equality for all females."

AB 732 seeks to improve these conditions by ensuring that pregnant people receive appropriate care, with a focus on safe and healthy pregnancies.

The bill has been sponsored by organizations like the ACLU of California and California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, and was introduced by Assembly Member Bonta. It has passed several legislative committees, including the Assembly and Senate Public Safety Committees, and is supported by various advocacy groups focused on gender equity and reproductive justice. The bill emphasizes the need for better health care services and accommodations to protect the well-being of incarcerated pregnant individuals."

Raab takes her personal experience and applies it when serving these women at life-changing crossroads in their decision-making. I am post-abortive, said Raab, Client Services Director for Pregnancy Care Center of Southeast Indiana PCC. God worked on my heart when I attended a banquet where post-abortion advocate Sydna Massey spoke, Raab said. It took me awhile to forgive myself. I feel that was a divine meeting, attending that banquet, a meeting only God orchestrates, she said. He can use everything for His glory. Raab came on staff at PCC in January 2019, and she remembers one of the first abortion-minded clients she met. Pregnancy Care Center of SE Indiana Click here to subscribe to Pregnancy Help News! Meet Cathy Fourteen-year-old Cathy came into the center with her mother, who had made the initial contact for an appointment. She was neutral about abortion, Raab said, and when the girls pregnancy test showed positive there was no reaction from the young client. The mother gave permission for Raab to meet one-on-one with her daughter. I learned she wanted to further her education and she perceived the baby to be a big stumbling block to obtaining her goal, she said. Yet, when asked, Cathy was able to identify several successful teen moms including her own! She saw no way out but abortion, yet she admitted to knowing little about abortion or any of the possible complications. Cathy filled out the centers decision guide, an assessment gauging where a client may be in the choice between abortion and life for their child. Abortion was almost 100 percent, Raab said. Afterward, Raab, who knew Cathy from a ministry at her church, prayed with the girl. We prayed together and went over pregnancy options information, she said. She had a reaction when she learned what abortion really is. Cathy was scheduled for an ultrasound the following week. Both daughter and mom were very emotionless upon returning for the ultrasound, Raab recalled. PCC of SE Indiana ultrasound room As I sat in the ultrasound room as a support, I was concerned Cathy was not connecting at all to the little life growing inside of her, she said. We met again alone after the scan for over an hour. Cathy was interested in what an abortion was really like, Raab said, so she shared the centers book outlining each type of procedure. Raab also shared her personal testimony of her abortion as a teen. I reminded Cathy before leaving that we would always be here for her no matter what decision she made, said Raab. Through follow-up calls, Raab learned Cathy had made a doctors appointment and shown family and friends the ultrasound picture. She came around slowly and now has a beautiful baby and has learned to balance school and being a mom, Raab said. Pregnancy Care Center of Southeast Indiana is like many pro-life pregnancy centers in ministering to women who often see abortion as their first or only option. Last year, more than 80 percent of the centers clients were assessed as either abortion-vulnerable or abortion-mindeddetermined. Similarly, a Colorado center, which operates two facilities, assessed 65 percent of its 2019 clientele as abortion vulnerable, minded, or determined, and Options Pregnancy Center in Helena, Montana has experienced an increase in the number of abortion-mindeddetermined women. Rewarding work Raab finds her job rewarding. Im a teacher by trade my work is just an extension of teaching, she said. PCC of SE Indiana reception area I want to help women find an alternative to Planned Parenthood, to help them find a safe place, Raab said. ""Thats the difference between pregnancy centers and Planned Parenthood we are the safe place where they can make an informed decision. Tweet This ""Thats the difference between pregnancy centers and Planned Parenthood we are the safe place where they can make an informed decision. That decision is often spurred because of an ultrasound. The center received a new, upgraded machine earlier this year, Raab said. We offer so much, but the most important thing we do is the ultrasound and giving the client a picture, she said. The center closed March 20 due to COVID-19 and re-opened on June 22. However, Raab stayed in touch with the centers clients during that time. Weve continued to work remotely, she said. I would check in with the women to find out where they were at in their decision-making, to provide them encouragement and support, and to give them resources they needed. Raab said she was looking forward to meeting in-person with women again. Karla Raab I have a personal motive I can help others through my story, she said. Its always my hope to not let anyone feel the need to go into a Planned Parenthood its so life-altering. She says she is driven to make a positive impact on women facing an unplanned pregnancy and in that she believes pregnancy care centers do make a positive impact. A pregnancy center is a safe place, a place of healing, a place for them to learn about the wonderful grace of God, she said. Women can process things in a safe way and have a chance of making a better decision, a more informed decision, thats going to affect them for the rest of their lives. The choices we make today are always going to affect us, for positive or negative. Tagged under abortion postabortion Pregnancy Care Center of Southeast Indiana pregnancy help Tweet Gayle M.

She shares her journey of post-abortion healing and her dedication to providing support and information to women in similar situations. Raab was profoundly impacted by an encounter with post-abortion advocate Sydna Massey, which led her to reconcile with her past and commit to helping others. She joined PCC in January 2019, where she met a 14-year-old client, Cathy, who was initially set on abortion. Through Raab’s guidance, Cathy learned more about abortion procedures and the potential risks, prompting her to choose life for her child. Raab’s approach combines her personal testimony with practical support, such as providing ultrasounds, which she believes are crucial in helping clients make informed decisions.

Raab sees pregnancy centers like PCC as safe spaces where women can make decisions without pressure, contrasting them with organizations like Planned Parenthood. The center’s ultrasound services are particularly impactful, offering women a chance to see their baby and consider alternatives to abortion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raab continued supporting clients remotely, checking in on their decision-making and offering resources.

Raab’s personal experience and faith drive her work, as she aims to offer healing, guidance, and hope to women in crisis. She believes pregnancy centers play a vital role in helping women make informed, life-affirming decisions that will positively impact their futures."

Wickline Gov. Asa Hutchinson and House Speaker Matthew Shepherd watch Friday as Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge signs the state abortion law certification Friday at her office in Little Rock. Hutchinson said he doesnt plan to ask the Legislature to change the law to provide exemptions in cases of rape or incest. More photos at arkansasonline.com625roe. Arkansas Democrat-GazetteStephen Swofford Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Friday signed a certificate implementing a 2019 law that bans abortions in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion across the country.At a news conference at her Little Rock office, the Republican attorney general certified that the nation's high court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling in accordance with Act 180 of 2019.""I am proud to announce as chief legal officer of the State of Arkansas that the United States Supreme Court has in fact overruled Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, thereby restoring to the state of Arkansas the authority to prohibit abortions,"" an emotional Rutledge said with Republican Gov. Asa Hutchison and House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, at her side.""This overturns the legal precedent that federal district courts and courts of appeal across the country has used to strike down pro-life laws like Arkansas',"" Rutledge said. ""This decision puts our pro-life laws in place and allows Arkansas to ban abortion with the only exception to save the life of the mother.""While anti-abortion advocates cheered Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling and Rutledge's action, abortion rights supporters were in despair.An official for the Planned Parenthood Great Plains said health care workers at an Arkansas clinic were crying about having to tell women they were no longer providing abortions.Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said Friday that ""With Roe overruled, and the attorney general having now certified that Arkansas's 2019 trigger ban is now in effect, anti-abortion politicians have finally succeeded in their long drive to ban abortion in Arkansas.""This will have an immediate and life-altering effect on all Arkansans -- especially people of color, immigrants, people who live in rural areas, young people and people with low incomes -- who already shoulder the brunt of inaccessibility,"" she warned in a news release.According to the state Department of Health, there were 3,133 abortions in Arkansas in 2021, compared with 4,033 in 2011 and 5,924 in 2001.The GOP-dominated Legislature and Hutchinson enacted Act 180 -- sponsored by state Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway -- in the 2019 regular session.Act 180 bars a person from purposely performing or attempting to perform an abortion except to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency. Performing or attempting to perform an abortion is an unclassified felony with a fine not to exceed 100,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 10 years or both under Act 180.The act states that it does not authorize the charging or conviction of a woman with any criminal offense in the death of her own unborn child.At the news conference in the attorney general's office, Hutchinson said he doesn't plan to ask the Legislature in a special session to change Act 180 to provide exemptions to allow abortions in cases of rape or incest.Act 180 of 2019 ""is the will of the Legislature,"" he said. ""They have expressed that. That's the public policy of the Arkansas. The certification is what it is in terms of the exceptions for the life of the mother.""I don't see any additional action on that,"" Hutchinson said. ""The people have spoken on that through their elected representatives and that is the law of the land in this state.""Hutchinson said the U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade ""is a turning point for our nation.""""As governor, I'm gratified by the court's ruling because the people of Arkansas have declared the public policy of this state is to protect the life of the unborn,"" Hutchinson said.Based on Rutledge's certification, the governor said he directed the state Department of Health to enforce the law and conduct the necessary inspections and notifications to assure that any abortion provider is in compliance with the law and understands its potential penalties.In a letter dated Friday to interim Department of Health Secretary Renee Mallory, Hutchinson said he directed the Health Department to issue notices to administrators of abortion providers to inform them of the high court's ruling, Rutledge's certification and ""the requirement to comply with the law, which does include criminal penalties.""Asked about the governor's comments that he is directing the Health Department to update its protocols, Health Department Director Jennifer Dillaha said later that, ""We'll have to work with our legal team to understand what all the ramifications are.""Whether the state Medical Board will need to update its rules for doctors is also a ""legal question,"" she said.At the news conference, Hutchinson said ""we need we as a state and as a nation to continue to support women who have unwanted pregnancies, and for some they see abortion as the only solution.""The Legislature provided 1 million to pregnancy resource centers across the state in the fiscal year starting July 1 and enacted the Every Mom Matters Act -- Act 90 of 2021 -- that will allow pregnant women to call a hotline to get information and assistance, he said.REACTION IN STATEGroups on both sides of the abortion issue spoke out on the Supreme Court ruling.House Democratic leader Tippi McCullough of Little Rock said Friday that Arkansas girls and women have lost the freedom to make intimate and personal choices regarding their own bodies that have profound effects on their families, personal dignity and autonomy based on the 2019 trigger law passed by the Arkansas Legislature.""Even more disturbing, this new trigger law goes to the extreme of even outlawing abortions where girls and women have been victimized through rape and incest,"" she said.""Arkansas legislators could choose to act and ensure our state protects our women and families, but sadly, extremists too often drive this difficult conversation,"" McCullough said. ""Given today's ruling the practical effect of this decision in Arkansas will re-victimize girls as young as 9, and all survivors of rape or incest, by forcing them to carry to term pregnancies that resulted from a violent crime. Legislators and Governor Hutchinson can still act to rectify this wrong and must.""At a news conference at the state Capitol on Friday morning, Jerry Cox, executive director of the Family Council, said he believes that a majority of the Legislature doesn't support exceptions to allow abortions in cases of rape or incest.""Rape and incest are absolutely horrible, deplorable acts, and we need to punish those who rape or commit incest to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said. ""Women who are victims of rape or incest need to have all the compassion that we can provide.""Cox said ""people act as if somehow doing an abortion for a person who is a victim of rape or incest is going to erase all that hurt, and I wish we could erase the trauma of rape or incest.""But the abortion doesn't do that,"" he said. ""In fact, everything that we read about and hear people talk about, abortion brings its own set of trauma and difficulty for the woman. .""Planned Parenthood Great Plains paused all abortion services in Arkansas on Friday.News of the Supreme Court ruling drove health care workers at an Arkansas clinic to tears Friday over having to tell patients the clinic was no longer providing abortions, said Dr. Iman Alsaden, medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which manages clinics in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.""Our staff is dealing with a lot of emotions from a lot of different patients when they are calling them to say 'we can't see you in Arkansas today or next week,'"" Alsaden said during a Friday news conference.The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling left Arkansans seeking abortions with limited options, according to Emily Wales, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.""Those patients now must figure out their next steps, whether that's fleeing their home states and communities for care, attempting to terminate their pregnancies without medical support or continuing pregnancies against their will,"" Wales said.Kansas is the only state within the region overseen by Planned Parenthood Great Plains that is still offering abortions. Providers there are already struggling to meet the demand for in-state patients, Wales said. Four facilities in Kansas are offering abortion services two in Wichita and two in the Kansas City area.""We anticipate that we will have more patients than we can serve who need the care we provide,"" Wales said.Planned Parenthood Great Plains clinics will continue providing sexual and reproductive care, according to Wales.Lori Williams, clinical director for Little Rock Family Planning Services, said her clinic was not prepared to issue a public statement on Friday. The Little Rock clinic lists medication and surgical abortion options on its website.A spokesperson for CHOICES -- Memphis Center for Reproductive Health couldn't be reached for comment Friday.The clinic provides abortion services to eastern and Central Arkansas, according to the center's website. A state ban in Tennessee was designed to take effect after the overturn of Roe, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group.LAWMAKERS WEIGH INIn interviews, three members of the state's all-Republican congressional delegation in Washington praised Friday's Supreme Court ruling.""We celebrate the decision today for simply saying that there's not a constitutional right to abortion and that that's now left up to the elected representatives,"" said U.S. Rep. French Hill of Little Rock.""If you don't have life, you don't get to pursue any other freedoms, so I think it is the number one freedom that every person should be afforded, and I think the Supreme Court fixed a grave error,"" said U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs.U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford of Jonesboro said anti-abortion activists had worked for decades to overturn Roe.""It does represent the culmination of -- for many -- their life's work,"" he added.Hutchinson emphasized that the high court's ruling doesn't put at risk of access to contraceptives or ""other issues that are tangentially related.""Act 180 of 2019 states that it does prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, drug or chemical, if the contraceptive measure, drug or chemical is administered before the time when a pregnancy could be determined through conventional medical testing and, if the contraceptive measure, drug or chemical is sold, used, prescribed or administered in accordance with manufacturer instructions.On Friday, Rapert said, ""It was my honor and privilege to sponsor Act 180 of 2019, the abortion trigger ban that was triggered upon the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.""This is a great day for our nation as future generations of Americans will be given a greater chance at realizing their own lives, liberties and pursuits of happiness by being born in the greatest country the world has known,"" he said in a news release.Cox thanked state lawmakers, Hutchinson and Rutledge for their work to make Arkansas the top pro-life state in the nation and enacting Act 180 of 2019.""Thankfully, that good law is now enforceable in the state of Arkansas, and we are grateful for it,"" he said.While ""we've now mostly succeeded at making abortion illegal in Arkansas, the next thing that we need to do is find a way to make abortion irrelevant and by that, I mean we need to find ways to help women with unplanned pregnancies, women who feel like they have no other choice but maybe go get an abortion,"" Cox said.He said the network of about 50 pregnancy help organizations that help girls and women with unplanned pregnancies across the state need to be strengthened.In November, the Americans United for Life group ranked Arkansas as the most pro-life state in the nation for the second conservative year. The group said Arkansas earned its first-place ranking after enacting 16 ""life-affirming"" laws over the course of the 2021 regular session. Arkansas is joined by Louisiana, Arizona, Oklahoma and Indiana in the top five.At this point, Cox said he does not expect the Family Council to push for legislation that might restrict a woman's ability to go to another state to get an abortion.""That said, we don't know exactly how our laws are going to play out until they are actually enforced, and so if there are flaws in the law, misses in the law, then the Legislature may have to come back and try to correct that later on,"" he said. ""But for now, I believe our laws are very strong and I believe are very adequate to do everything that needs to be done.""Asked whether the state Legislature should consider putting restrictions in Arkansas on women seeking abortions in other states, Rutledge said, ""I think today that we need to focus on this incredible victory and historic moment and the law that we have passed in Arkansas.Rutledge said she encouraged anyone to talk with legislators and her about potential policy changes in the future.Asked about the potential for other abortion restrictions, Shepherd said Arkansas is the most pro-life state in the nation based on the Legislature's actions in previous sessions.""As far as I am concerned, the law is settled on this point,"" he said. ""We vigorously debated these issues and that's what allowed us to be prepared in the event that a decision such as this were handed down from the Supreme Court.""Shepherd said he has not been part of discussions on other abortion bills.""Quite honestly, today I am thankful for the fact that the first time in my lifetime unborn children in the state of Arkansas are protected, and for the first time in my lifetime the decision of abortion is returned to the people's elected representatives,"" he said.State Rep. Vivian Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Friday that the medical privacy, decision-making and very lives of women have been breached by what amounts to an attack on women for the sake of political power-mongering and the unfortunate cheapening of the U.S. Supreme Court.""This ruling destroys the promise of equal protection by waiving the banner of state's rights over the rights of women to choose and to live,"" she said in a news release issued through the state Democratic Party.Information for this story was contributed by Stephen Simpson, Will Langhorne, Andy Davis and Ryan Tarinelli of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Family Council president Jerry Cox center said Friday that he doesnt support allowing abortion exemptions in cases of rape or incest, saying abortion doesnt erase all that hurt but said women in that situation need to have all the compassion that we can provide.

Wade, Arkansas has enacted a near-total abortion ban through the implementation of Act 180 of 2019. The law prohibits abortions except in cases where the mother’s life is at risk in a medical emergency. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge signed the certification, marking the law’s activation after the Supreme Court ruling. This action has made Arkansas one of the states with the strictest abortion laws in the country.

Governor Asa Hutchinson and other state officials, including House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, expressed strong support for the law, emphasizing the state’s commitment to protecting unborn life. They also indicated there would be no immediate changes to include exceptions for rape or incest, which has been a point of contention among opponents of the law.

Proponents of the ban, including members of the state legislature and anti-abortion groups like the Family Council, hailed the ruling as a victory for life. However, opponents, including the ACLU of Arkansas and Planned Parenthood, expressed distress over the decision’s impact, especially on vulnerable groups such as young people, people of color, and low-income individuals. Abortion providers in the state, like Planned Parenthood Great Plains, ceased all abortion services immediately after the law took effect, citing the emotional toll on both staff and patients.

The law also criminalizes performing abortions, with penalties including fines and imprisonment. While Hutchinson and Rutledge assured the public that the law would be enforced, they also highlighted efforts to support pregnant women through programs like the “Every Mom Matters Act” and state-funded pregnancy resource centers. However, critics, particularly Democratic leaders, decried the loss of personal autonomy for women and the lack of exceptions in cases of rape or incest, arguing that this would harm victims of violent crimes.

Overall, Arkansas has become a focal point in the national debate over abortion rights, with the state’s strict laws drawing both praise and condemnation. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing discussions about potential future legislative actions."

Terrisa Bukovinac, founder of Pro-Life San Francisco, holds a model of a fetus as she and other anti-abortion protesters wait outside the Supreme Court for a decision, Monday, June 29, 2020. The Supreme Court has struck down a Louisiana law regulating abortion clinics, reasserting a commitment to abortion rights over fierce opposition from dissenting conservative justices in the first big abortion case of the Trump era. PATRICK SEMANSKY AP By Kirby WilsonTimes staffPublished April 22, 2021Updated April 22, 2021TALLAHASSEE Most abortion bills are controversial. A bill making its way through the Florida House that would ban disability abortions is no exception particularly for the disability community.But its less the abortion part of the bill thats an issue for some in that community. Its more the disability part.The bill, House Bill 1221, would ban a doctor from performing an abortion in an instance where they know, or should know, a woman is seeking the procedure solely on the basis of a disability or potential disability found in the fetus. Sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, the bill is part of a national effort to restrict abortion access in these instances. At least nine states have laws banning abortion in similar circumstances most of those laws have been legal challenged.Proponents of these efforts say its a moral imperative to prohibit disability abortions, which they liken to eugenics the bigoted practice of striving to improve the human gene pool by removing genetic traits seen as undesirable from the population.On Thursday, Gralls bill is scheduled to be debated in the House. It could pass this week. However, its unlikely to become law this year because a companion measure sponsored by Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez, R-Miami, was first referred to a committee chaired by Democrat Lauren Book. It never got a hearing there.When asked why her bill hadnt gained any traction in the Senate, Rodriguez said, Thats a great question, and I dont have the answer.Some advocates for people with disability say the bill, which purports to champion a marginalized community, only pays lip service to the idea. For example, those advocates take issue with the bills definition of disability any disease, defect, or disorder that is genetically inherited. After that definition, the bill then lists several example conditions Down syndrome scoliosis dwarfism albinism, etc.Olivia Babis, a senior public policy analyst at the advocacy group Disability Rights Florida, and herself a person with a disability, said that definition does not do those with disabilities justice. Babis said the definition of disability varies depending on the context. In her own home, Babis is comfortable, and has the accommodations she needs. Elsewhere, she needs more help. A better definition, Babis contended, would be a condition that leaves a person with an inability to complete one or more activities of daily living.It feels more like a list of stigmatized populations that we can determine in utero than a definition of actual disability, Babis said.Neither Grall nor her office responded to requests for comments. However, she faced many of the same criticisms enumerated by disability advocates like Babis as the bill made its way through two House committees. In those committees, the criticisms were brought by Democratic opponents of the bill.For example, in response to the criticism about her bills definition of disability, Grall said she did not mean to demean the disability community.The language in this bill is not intended to shame at all, and if anything it is meant to hold up the fact that each of these different disabilities is something that we value, Grall said.Laura Minutello of Valrico, who has cerebral palsy, said in an interview that she was at high risk of being aborted because her birth mother was an addict. She noted that like any segment of the American population, the disability community has a diverse set of views when it comes to abortion.But Minutello said that Gralls bill is hard to square given the track record Florida has of not offering enough of a safety net for people who need extra accommodations.Its not so much that I or anybody that I know really disagrees with the intent of the bill, its more that within the disability community, we feel that to truly value the lives of people with disabilities, you have to give them the supports and the things that everybody else has, Minutello said.Babis noted that she requested a special accommodation by the House to testify virtually on the disability abortion bill earlier in the legislative process. The disability advocate said she is especially susceptible to COVID-19, and she didnt want to risk being infected during a trip to the Capitol where several lawmakers have contracted the virus. Even though state agency heads and other advocates have been allowed to testify virtually on bills in the Florida House, Babis request was denied.Florida also has tens of thousands of people on its waiting list for services provided under the states iBudget waiver. That Medicaid-supported program funds often costly at-home services for people with developmental disabilities.This year, the Senate and House are currently haggling over funding to get more people off the wait list. The House has proposed spending 15 million to get 306 more people off the list.But advocates say more could be done. The state could offer a program allowing working people with disabilities to buy into the states Medicaid program. Lawmakers could spend even more money to get even more people off the wait list. They could also fund more job training initiatives for people with disabilities, or spend more money on home modification programs.Grall fielded the criticism that her abortion bill did not do enough for the disability community at a committee hearing earlier this month. She said she agreed on this point.I consider myself an advocate for people with disabilities and do understand and appreciate the system is a patchwork, Grall said then. That is outside the scope of my bill, but its not outside the scope of my heart for what we need to be doing as a Legislature.There are also those in the disability community who say anti-abortion efforts like Gralls are antithetical to the disability rights movement which they say is all about bodily autonomy.Robyn Powell, a visiting assistant professor at Stetson University College of Law, studies the intersection of abortion and reproductive rights. She also has arthrogryposis, a condition which leaves her with limited use of her arms and legs.Powell argued that like every abortion restriction, a disability abortion ban would hurt the least fortunate the most. Well-off abortion seekers, she contended, would still be able to get access to an abortion, and theyd be more likely to have the legal savvy to sidestep this ban. Or theyd be able to travel to another state to get the procedure done.I see these bills as using disability as a justification for taking abortion rights away, Powell said.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall, would prohibit doctors from performing such abortions, framing the legislation as a moral imperative to prevent what some view as eugenics—the practice of eliminating undesirable genetic traits. Proponents argue that the bill defends the lives of people with disabilities.

However, critics, including members of the disability community, argue that the bill’s definition of disability is problematic and fails to genuinely support people with disabilities. The bill lists conditions such as Down syndrome, scoliosis, and dwarfism, but disability advocates like Olivia Babis contend that it oversimplifies disability, reducing it to stigmatized traits rather than considering the actual challenges people with disabilities face. Babis, who has a disability herself, argues that a more comprehensive definition would focus on the ability to perform daily activities, rather than simply listing genetic disorders.

Other critics, like Laura Minutello, a person with cerebral palsy, note the bill’s inconsistency with Florida’s insufficient support systems for people with disabilities. She emphasizes that to truly value the lives of people with disabilities, the state should focus more on providing adequate accommodations and services rather than limiting abortion options.

Moreover, some disability advocates see the bill as counterproductive to the disability rights movement, which prioritizes bodily autonomy. Robyn Powell, a law professor with a disability, argues that such abortion restrictions disproportionately harm low-income individuals, who would have less access to abortion services even in states where abortion might still be available.

Despite these concerns, the bill has garnered some support and is scheduled for debate in the Florida House, although its companion bill in the Senate has stalled. The debate continues to unfold, with advocates calling for a more nuanced approach that addresses both the needs of people with disabilities and the complex issue of abortion rights."

Pro-life activists painted a Baby Lives Matter mural on the road in front of a Planned Parenthood center in the historic Cherry Neighborhood. The mural has since been removed. Some of the Cherry neighborhood residents were angry that the mural was painted near their homes. They also told WCCB that some of the pro-life activists were rude and yelled profanities at people in the neighborhood the day before the painting appeared in the roadway. However, Tayler Hansen, artist and Founder of Baby Lives Matter, says the group the neighbors are referring to were not associated with the Baby Lives Matter movement. Hansen provided this statement to WCCB The days of normalizing racism, murder, Infanticide, and organ trafficking will soon come to an end. Baby Lives Matter represents a true peaceful protest. A GoFundMe account was created to help fund artists who are painting the Baby Lives Matter murals around the country. The first one was painted on July 15th outside a Planned Parenthood in Salt Lake City, Utah. According to the GoFundMe page, Hansen painted for seven straight hours in front of his local Planned Parenthood to complete the mural. As of August 26th, the Baby Lives Matter page has raised over 17,000. A spokesperson with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department says officers responded to the area due to a report regarding vandalism in the street. CMPD says the incident is being investigated.

Wade.Now, nine years later, O'Brien, 43, is part of an abortion case before the U.S. Supreme Court that has the potential to dramatically change the landscape of abortion access across the United States, particularly in Louisiana, where the case originates.Editors PicksLady Gaga, Ariana Grande and more join Planned Parenthood's BansOffMyBody campaignSelf-induced abortion searches on Google reflect a dark reality for many womenThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case, June Medical Services vs. Russo, this month.O'Brien, now a mom to two daughters, decided to tell her story publicly and join the case as an amicus curiae, or ""friend of the court,"" because she does not want any women, including her daughters, to be denied medical care, specifically access to abortions, because of where they live or the resources they do or do not have.""My experience was really eye-opening that women all over the place are having to comply with all these unnecessary restrictions,"" O'Brien told ""Good Morning America."" ""And a lot of them probably ultimately don't get their abortion because they don't have the privileges, the financial support, the capabilities that I did.""Kim O'Brien poses with her husband and their two daughters.Kim O'BrienO'Brien's experience seeking an abortion after a devastating ultrasound taken at 20 weeks was made more difficult -- logistically, financially and emotionally -- because of the patchwork of state laws like the one the Supreme Court is reviewing, called targeted restrictions on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, by abortion rights advocates. Rather than overarching bans, which often get stopped by courts, these seemingly more minor laws work to limit abortion access in reality in a variety of ways.""It makes me really sad and really frustrated,"" she said. ""And I feel empowered to do all that I can to try to make things better for them.""A 'perfect storm' that changed abortion accessThe case of June Medical Services v. Russo centers on a 2014 Louisiana state law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges with a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic, which allows a patient to go to that hospital should urgent care be required.If the law is upheld by the Supreme Court, Louisiana, a state of more than 4.6 million people whose population is 51 female, would likely go from having three abortion clinics in the state down to one, according to Kathaleen Pittman, administrator of the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, the lead plaintiff in the case.The state would likely have just one physician with admitting privileges who could perform abortions, she told ""GMA.""""When we decided to challenge the law, we really had no other option. It was that or shut down,"" said Pittman, who has worked at Hope for nearly three decades. ""There is no exaggeration when I tell you that this is a really critical decision that's about to be handed down.""An exterior photo of the Hope Medical Group for Women, Feb. 20, 2020, in Shreveport, La.Rebecca SantanaAPThe Louisiana law behind the case of June Medical Services v. Russo is similar to a law in Texas that was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2016 -- indeed, in 2017, a federal judge struck it down on the basis on the 2016 Supreme Court decision.In that 5-3 decision, the Supreme Court majority said the law, which required doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and also mandated that abortion clinics meet state requirements for licensed surgical centers, created an ""undue burden"" on patients seeking access to abortion.""When the law passed, we went from 44 clinics in 2013 down to six when the law was fully enforced throughout the state,"" said Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Woman's Health, the Texas-based health organization that challenged the law. ""It just created this perfect storm that really crumbled the fabric of access to abortion services that had existed prior to its passing.""MORE Everyone talks about Roe v. Wade but women's health groups say Supreme Court could 'gut' abortion access without actually overturning itDespite the Supreme Court's decision, the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Louisiana's 2014 law is substantively different from the Texas measure and should be upheld because it does not ""impose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women"" in the state. The Supreme Court is reviewing that decision.Even though abortion rights advocates gained a victory in the 2016 Supreme Court ruling on the Texas law, the limited time the law was in effect still managed to decimate access to abortion care for people in the state, according to Hagstrom Miller.""Many clinics had to close, or let their lease go, or couldn't pay their mortgage, or their doctors and staffs all got different jobs,"" she said of the effect of the three-year legal battle. ""The win was a super strong win on paper, but it came three years after the law went into effect such that it was remarkably difficult for clinics to reopen -- or new clinics to start.""June Medical Services v. RussoABC NEWSHagstrom Miller estimates there are now less than two dozen abortion clinics in Texas, a state with a population of nearly 29 million that is 50 female. By comparison, the state of Massachusetts, with a population of nearly seven million, had 47 facilities providing abortion as of 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute.""One of the things I've seen is we have a generation of people now who have come to just expect restrictions on abortions,"" she said. ""They expect that there's going to be multiple delays in a waiting period and all these hoops to jump through in order to get an abortion.""In Louisiana, a 24-hour waiting period is also legally required for patients seeking an abortion, meaning they must make two trips to an abortion provider, which is often hours away from their home due to the shrinking number of clinics. Each visit can last as long as five hours, according to Pittman.MORE 2-year battle over Indiana abortion clinic highlights politically motivated licensing laws Advocates""On day one, we are required by law to perform an ultrasound . and the stenographer goes into great detail about what he or she is seeing on the screen as far as fetal development,"" she said, adding that, because of state law, the ultrasound screen must be facing the patient with the sound on. ""From the ultrasound, they spend one-on-one time with the patient advocate, and from there they spend time one-on-one with a physician who goes again through the process, explaining it in great detail.""Louisiana also requires parental consent for minors seeking an abortion, does not allow the use of telemedicine to administer medication abortion, and allows abortions to be performed at 20 weeks or more postfertilization ""only in cases of life or severely compromised physical health, or lethal fetal anomaly,"" according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.A Capitol employee walks through the U.S. Supreme Court plaza in Washington, March 18, 2020.Tom BrennerReuters, FILEBoth Miller and Pittman worry that if the Supreme Court reverses course and votes to uphold the Louisiana law in June Medical Services vs. Russo, it will mobilize other state legislatures, including Texas, to put more abortion restrictions in place.In 2019 alone, more than 350 pieces of legislation restricting abortions were introduced across the country, according to the Guttmacher Institute.""Every time a barrier to abortion is successfully implemented in one state, another state follows,"" said Pittman. ""If we don't have an absolute win this time, we're going to see a lot of activity from other states trying to get cases before the Supreme Court as well.""What admitting privileges mean At the heart of June Medical Services vs. Russo is a debate over admitting privileges, which a hospital may grant to doctors to allow them to admit patients to that hospital and provide medical services there.All doctors are licensed in Louisiana through a separate process to ensure competency and safety.Whether a hospital decides to grant admitting privileges to a doctor is a subjective process that is often reduced to numbers and whether the doctor will bring in enough revenue, i.e. patients, to the hospital to make it worth it. Hospitals can also deny admitting privileges if they do not want the doctor's specialty, i.e. abortion care, at their hospital.Because abortion statistically has very low complication rates, the need for hospital care is extremely rare.Kathaleen Pittman, the administrator of the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, La., works in her office, Feb. 20, 2020.Rebecca SantanaAPAt Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, there have been just four or five direct transfers to a hospital in the last 25 years, according to Pittman.""That record stands for itself,"" she said, noting that only one of the clinic's two physicians currently has admitting privileges and the other has not been able to get them.Dr. Pooja Mehta, an OBGYN in Louisiana and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, calls requiring admitting privileges for abortion care an ""added step that is not necessary for good care.""""Abortion care doesn't require a hospital to be safe,"" she told ""GMA."" ""If you are the one in 1,000 case where that abortion may need to be watched more closely in a hospital, that abortion provider can still send someone to an emergency room and that person will still be seen in a hospital.""""There is no science that suggests that require admitting privileges makes abortion safer,"" she said.MORE Louisiana abortion case may hinge on Supreme Court Chief Justice RobertsIn the U.S., three states -- Missouri, North Dakota and Utah -- currently require admitting privileges for abortion providers, while efforts to enforce similar requirements have been blocked in eight states, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Advocates for admitting privileges argue the law is simply meant to keep women safe.According to the office of Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, Hope and other abortion providers in the state have ""admitted on the record that they dont have accurate data on complications.""""Louisiana abortion providers have a record of non-compliance with basic safety regulations, and now they want a special exemption from generally accepted medical standards that apply to similar surgical procedures in our state,"" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said in a statement in March, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case. ""Women seeking abortions deserve better than that they should have the same assurance of prompt and proper care in the event of complications.""A 2014 study by UC San Francisco researchers of over 50,000 abortion patients in California found major complications occurred less than a quarter of a percent of the time.What happens when patients don't have access to abortion care In 2017, 9,920 abortions were provided in Louisiana, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Pittman described a ""dark cloud"" constantly over her head as she worries where those people -- who also travel from states including Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi -- will get help if the admitting privileges requirement is upheld and abortion providers in Louisiana are forced to close their doors.""For a lot of women, this unplanned pregnancy is a crisis for them,"" she said. ""And a woman who comes to us, more often than not, has decided this is what she wants to do.""The majority of patients who seek care at Hope Medical Group live at or below the federal poverty level, according to Pittman. She said the most common reason given for pregnancy termination by patients at Hope is ""lack of financial stability.""""Often times, we hear from women that they need to make the best decision for the family they already have,"" she said. ""They need to protect their family and make sure their family is OK.""Across the country, patients who are denied abortions face a ""large and persistent increase"" in financial distress in the years after, according to a working paper published earlier this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research.Looking at credit report data, researchers found that being denied an abortion increases the amount of debt 30 days or more past due by 78 and increases negative public records, such as bankruptcies and evictions, by 81. The economic fallout appeared to be the worst for woman who were forced to have a child when they were not prepared to, the data shows.In Louisiana, nearly 19 of the population lives in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Women who carry their pregnancies to full term also face health complications, data shows. While a small number of abortions require hospital care, the state of Louisiana has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country.Louisiana ranks second in the country in maternal deaths, behind only Georgia, with 44.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 lives birth, according to an analysis last year by U.S. News World Report.'It's shocking to me that nine years later the situation is worse'The lack of access to abortion care that Pittman predicts would be made worse with an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling is what O'Brien experienced in 2011 when she learned at her 20-week ultrasound that the fetus she was carrying had ""severe brain abnormalities.""After seeking second, third and fourth medical opinions and talking to trusted family and friends, O'Brien, an attorney, and her husband, a medical doctor, decided to terminate the pregnancy.""It was all bad news and would not have resulted in a healthy baby if it was to survive to the end of the pregnancy,"" said O'Brien. ""At that ultrasound appointment, our doctor told us, 'You know, you have a lot to think about. If you decide that you want to terminate the pregnancy, the clock is ticking. There are restrictions in Louisiana.'""MORE What to know about new abortion restrictions and what they could mean for Roe v. Wade""I knew that I had a legal right to an abortion, but I just didn't know much about the practicalities,"" she said. ""I assumed that I would just go back to my doctor and say, 'OK, we're ready.' I was wrong.""O'Brien said her provider told her he could not perform the procedure and she was advised by other doctors that her ""best bet"" was to travel out of state. She had to do research on her own to see if laws in nearby states would allow her to have an abortion there. By the next year, 2012, the state enacted a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of a pregnancy, with limited exceptions.She also had to find a doctor on her own and says it was only thanks to her husband's medical network that she found a doctor in Texas who would perform an abortion at her stage in pregnancy.O'Brien and her husband drove six hours from their home in New Orleans to Houston for the procedure. They had to take time off work, arrange childcare for their daughter, who was 1 at the time, and pay for a three-night stay at a hotel.MORE Supreme Court set to hear critical Louisiana abortion case""I was given no guidance and I know that I have privileges that the vast majority of women don't have,"" she said. ""I have a legal education. My husband has a medical education and training. We have this vast social and professional network of other healthcare providers. We have financial resources . we had my parents' support and availability to keep our child for three nights. My husband was able to take off work, which so many people don't have the ability to do.""""All of those things I know that the average person does not have, and still it was near impossible for me to get the abortion,"" said O'Brien, who experienced an additional logistical complication once she was admitted at a Houston hospital for the procedure.Kim O'Brien, right, poses with a friend at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.Kim O'BrienO'Brien said that after waiting for hours in her hospital room, her doctor told her the hospital's board had changed their policy a week prior to say they would no longer allow abortions beyond 20 weeks. The hospital had not yet informed the OBGYN department about the new rule but hospital officials said her procedure could not move forward, according to O'Brien.""Ultimately they connected with another abortion provider who had a clinic in the area, and I had to be taken by wheelchair across the street to a medical office building where they started the procedure, and then I had to be wheeled back to the hospital so that they could complete the abortion,"" she said. ""It was absolutely insane and had nothing to do with my health or anyone's health.""In the 2016 case, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a concurring opinion that ""Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws that 'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion' cannot survive judicial inspection."" Even so, lawmakers and judges have moved forward with similar laws in many states, as the Louisiana case shows. O'Brien says that if her circumstance had occurred today, she would not be able to get an abortion in either state due to additional laws enacted in each state.""It's shocking to me that nine years later, the situation is worse,"" she said.ABC News' Alexandra Svokos and Devin Dwyer contributed to this report.Editor's note This story has been updated to clarify restrictions O'Brien faced and add detail on complications.Related TopicsSupreme CourtTop StoriesJudge rules evidence related to 'Access Hollywood' tape admissible in Trump trialMar 18, 635 PMState Medicaid offices target dead peoples homes to recoup their health care costsMar 16, 418 PMTrump claims Liz Cheney and Jan. 6 committee should be jailedMar 18, 858 PMTrump faces 'insurmountable difficulties' in securing 464M bond in civil fraud caseMar 18, 1047 AMTimeline of college student's disappearance after night out in Nashville3 hours agoABC News Live247 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights 2024 ABC News","The article highlights the personal story of Kim O’Brien, a Louisiana woman who underwent an abortion in 2011 due to severe complications with her pregnancy. Her experience, which involved significant logistical and financial hurdles, is part of a broader debate surrounding abortion access, particularly in Louisiana, where restrictive laws, such as the one being challenged in June Medical Services v. Russo, are under scrutiny by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The June Medical Services v. Russo case involves a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. If upheld, this law could drastically reduce the number of abortion clinics in Louisiana, potentially leaving only one clinic to serve the state’s population of over 4.6 million people. This follows a pattern of “TRAP” (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws that impose strict requirements on abortion clinics, which advocates argue are not based on medical necessity but on restricting access to care. A similar law in Texas led to a sharp reduction in abortion clinics, which advocates say harms women’s health and safety by limiting access to care.

O’Brien, who was able to travel out of state and find an abortion provider despite facing many challenges, joined the case as an amicus curiae to prevent other women from experiencing the same barriers. Her case emphasizes how such laws disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color, who lack the resources to travel for care. The article also highlights the economic and health consequences for women who are unable to access abortion care, with research showing that being denied an abortion leads to financial hardship and worsened health outcomes.

The Supreme Court’s decision on this case could significantly influence abortion access across the country, as other states may follow Louisiana’s lead if the law is upheld. Proponents of the law argue it ensures safety for women, but opponents, including healthcare professionals, argue that requiring admitting privileges for abortion providers is unnecessary and burdensome, especially since abortion is a low-risk procedure.

O’Brien’s story reflects the broader consequences of restrictive abortion laws, which can place significant barriers in the way of women seeking essential healthcare. The outcome of the case is critical, as it could set a precedent for abortion access nationwide."

The ban, which was a “trigger law” set to activate after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, would have made performing an abortion a felony, with exceptions only for rape, incest, or to protect the mother’s life. However, a lower court had already blocked the ban in the summer of 2022 after the Red River Women’s Clinic (RRWC), the state’s only abortion provider, argued that the right to an abortion was guaranteed under the North Dakota state constitution.

In its ruling, the state Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Jon J. Jensen, found that the ban violated fundamental rights, including the right to life and safety. The Court noted that while the legislature has the authority to regulate abortion, the state constitution protects abortion access in certain circumstances, such as life-threatening situations. Therefore, the ban was not sufficiently tailored to meet the strict scrutiny standards of the constitution.

This decision means that North Dakota’s current 21-week abortion limit remains in effect. Advocates for reproductive rights, including Nancy Northup, President of the Center for Reproductive Rights, praised the ruling, arguing that it protected North Dakotans’ reproductive freedoms. Following the decision, RRWC moved its operations from Fargo to Moorhead, Minnesota, though it expressed no plans to return to North Dakota.

North Dakota’s Attorney General, Drew Wrigley, criticized the ruling and indicated that the state legislature would now work to craft new abortion laws in line with the Court’s decision."

In Florida, the gestational limit for abortions could drop from 15 weeks to 12. Elsewhere, lawmakers have abortion pills in their sights.When Roe v Wade fell, most states were no longer in legislative session, meaning the term during which they usually write and pass bills had ended. In January, state legislatures will reconvene in an entirely new reality, one where conservative lawmakers are no longer constrained by the constitutional right to abortion once assured by Roe.Googling abortion? Your details arent as private as you thinkRead moreThe midterm elections brought victories for abortion rights in a number of states. But in others, politics are on the side of anti-abortion advocates. In those reddest of states, the new state legislative sessions are likely to bring a fresh onslaught of efforts to restrict, penalize or altogether ban abortion.Katie Glenn, the state policy director at Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, confirms the groups top priority in 2023 will be reducing the gestational age for legal abortion, alongside bringing new outright bans. Abortion is currently banned in 13 states.Exactly how restrictive those bans will be remains to be seen, with conservatives across the country embroiled in conflicts over which exceptions if any should be allowed for abortion. Exceptions in the case of rape and incest, we realise, are sometimes a necessary political reality. And we would not block a bill or oppose a bill that would prevent 95 of abortions, explains Glenn.In some states, anti-abortion advocates previously stymied by Democrats now have room to maneuver since the midterms, which brought some conservative wins. In 2022, progressive members of Nebraskas legislature filibustered a ban proposed by Republicans, effectively killing it. But lawmakers say that the party no longer has the votes to block an abortion ban. Meanwhile, in states where abortion bans have been mired in lengthy court proceedings, Republican majorities could pass more stringent laws when the session starts.In Iowa, for example, a six-week ban has been held up in court since 2019. With the legislature reconvening on 9 January, it could choose to pass a new ban rather than waiting for the courts. That would be helped by the fact that, just before Roe fell, Iowas state supreme court ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion in the state. With the midterms solidifying conservative majorities in both chambers, that clears the path toward a tougher ban though Republicans in the state have said they will discuss next steps only after the court resolves the lawsuit over the six-week ban.Similarly, a six-week ban in Georgia that was recently reinstated by the state supreme court could pave the way for new restrictions when the legislature convenes, considering that Georgias governor, state house and state senate are all under Republican control. And in Florida, where the GOP clinched supermajorities in both chambers, legislators have indicated an interest in further limiting abortion, lowering the gestational limit from 15 to 12 weeks.View image in fullscreenAbortion rights protesters in Atlanta, Georgia. Photograph Alyssa PointerReutersAny legislation in Florida ultimately depends on its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. DeSantis has grown quiet on the issue as bans have increasingly proven unpopular, and since he is weighing up a 2024 presidential bid, he may hold off.Nor does Republican control over state governments elsewhere necessarily guarantee new restrictions. In some states, consensus has been hard to come by in a GOP increasingly mired by internal divisions.In South Carolina, for example, several attempts to pass an abortion ban in special session in 2022 failed despite a strong Republican majority.Lawmakers were at odds over how far a ban should go, with some supporting an exception for young rape victims, or in cases where there would be no chance of the fetus surviving outside the womb. Ultimately, those differences proved insurmountable neither side budged, and none of the proposed bans moved forward. A separate six-week ban is making its way through state courts, and abortion in the state remains legal up until 22 weeks.Targeting medication abortionSince Roe fell, requests for medication that can induce a miscarriage have shot up, and medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Conservatives are increasingly concerned with how to enforce abortion bans in a climate where people can access pills online and manage their own abortions. Medication abortion is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and considered very safe in the first trimester. In Oklahoma, lawmakers have asked the state attorney general to clarify whether self-managed abortion through pills violates the law. Introducing in-person screening requirements is another way to make abortion medication harder to access, especially in states without bans. For example, a Kansas law tried to ban providers from prescribing for medication abortion through telehealth. That law was shot down by a judge last month.Restricting telemedicine is one route anti-abortion advocates will take to target medication abortion this year, says Glenn, of SBA Pro-Life America.Students for Life America, another anti-abortion group, intends to go after medication abortion through environmental laws, through bills that would require fetal tissue to be treated as medical waste, curtailing the ability for people to manage their abortions at home. A petition to that effect has already been filed at the federal level with the Food and Drug Administration. Criminalizing abortionStates that ban abortion typically impose criminal penalties on providers who violate bans, but exempt at least formally the person actually seeking the abortion. Far-right groups have advocated for an end to that exemption, but their efforts have so far proved politically untenable in Louisiana, a bill looking to bring murder charges against people who end their own pregnancies failed to pass over the summer, with most Republicans finding it too extreme.Abortion rights advocates are bracing themselves for further such efforts, including bills to criminalize out-of-state travel for abortion an effort attempted in 2022 by Missouri, without success.Over a dozen states that put abortion bans in effect in 2022 are states with trifectas that are hostile to abortion rights. In those states that have been the most rabidly anti-abortion, we expect to see a next generation of measures that either remove the exemptions in the current law, or increase the penalties or the enforcement mechanisms to ban abortions, says Jessica Arons, senior policy counsel for the ACLU.They are also watching efforts to widen the net to penalize those providing assistance to people seeking abortions, including employers.Other legislation already filed in Texas ahead of the new legislative sessionincludes a bill that would count a fetus as a person in the HOV lane another that would limit tax subsidies for businesses providing support for employees seeking abortions and legislation that would make it harder for prosecutors to refuse to enforce abortion bans.Bolstered protections in blue statesAmid the barrage of restrictions, other states have made moves to bolster protections for abortion rights. In the midterms, Michigan, Vermont and California protected abortion in their state constitutions. And throughout the country, there are moves to pass and strengthen so-called shield laws to protect providers caring for patients from states with bans.If youre an abortion fund in California, and you give money to somebody from Texas . what kind of protections do we need?Elizabeth NashPeople are looking at those shield laws to see if there are any protections for abortion funds, for example, explains the Guttmacher Institutes policy expert Elizabeth Nash. If youre an abortion fund in California, and you give money to somebody from Texas to come to California for an abortion, what kind of protections do we need to make sure theyre not legally liable?Since Roe fell, states like California, Maryland and Delaware have expanded access, including to those from out of state, by passing laws enabling nurses to perform abortions. Meanwhile, in New York, the governor, Kathy Hochul, has allocated millions of dollars to abortion providers and the state is also pursuing efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the states constitution.These types of efforts are what states hoping to bolster protections will be looking to. People are seeing where there are gaps are in these laws, and trying to fill them basically, Nash says.Explore more on these topicsAbortionRoe v WadeReproductive rightsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved. dcr","Following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, which removed the federal protection for abortion rights, conservative lawmakers in U.S. states are poised to introduce a wave of new abortion restrictions in the 2023 legislative sessions. States like Nebraska and Florida could see significant new limitations, such as total abortion bans or further reductions in the gestational age limit for abortion. Some states are revisiting abortion bans that were previously delayed by the courts, like in Iowa and Georgia, where new or stricter measures could be introduced as conservative control strengthens.

A key focus for anti-abortion groups, like Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is to reduce the legal gestational limit for abortion and pass outright bans, with exceptions for cases like rape and incest often becoming a point of negotiation. The debate over such exceptions will influence the specific terms of future bans. States like South Carolina have struggled to reach consensus on the specifics of abortion bans due to internal GOP divisions.

Another area of concern for conservatives is medication abortion, which now makes up the majority of abortions. Efforts are underway to limit access to abortion pills, including through restrictions on telemedicine consultations, as seen in Kansas, and proposals to treat fetal tissue from medication abortions as medical waste.

Some far-right groups are pushing for laws that would penalize people seeking abortions, but these efforts face political opposition, as seen in Louisiana, where attempts to charge individuals with murder for self-managed abortions failed. However, further such efforts are anticipated, including criminalizing out-of-state abortion travel, as attempted in Missouri in 2022.

Meanwhile, abortion rights groups are focusing on expanding protections in states with strong abortion access. In response to restrictive laws, blue states like California, Michigan, and Vermont have moved to protect abortion rights in their constitutions. California and others have also passed laws that protect providers and patients from out-of-state legal repercussions. These “shield laws” aim to provide legal safeguards for both individuals and abortion providers, especially those assisting patients from states with stricter abortion laws.

In summary, while conservative states prepare for more aggressive abortion restrictions, particularly targeting medication abortion and expanding penalties, liberal states are working to safeguard and expand access to abortion services."

Indiana became the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court ended nearly a half-century of federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Although Planned Parenthoods four Indiana abortion clinics have stopped providing abortions, Gibron said its 11 health centers across the state continue offering a wide range of services, including emergency contraception and birth control, even as the group works to help Hoosiers obtain out-of-state abortions.

Eric Holcomb signs proclamation condemning antisemitism while vetoing bill defining it After dangerous tornadoes in Ohio and Indiana, survivors salvage, reflect and prepare for recovery Planned Parenthood will not be intimidated and bullied and we will not be silenced, she said at a news conference outside one of the groups clinics that provided abortions in Indianapolis. Indianas ban will eliminate the licenses for all seven abortion clinics in the state one of which closed in June and ban most abortions, even in the earliest stages of a pregnancy. It includes exceptions allowing abortions at hospitals in cases of rape or incest before 10 weeks post-fertilization. It also allows abortions up to 20 weeks to protect the life and physical health of the mother or if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. Before Indianas ban was passed, the states laws generally prohibited abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and tightly restricted them after the 13th week.The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, representing Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic operators, challenged the bans constitutionality. But in a June 30 ruling, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the ban doesnt violate the state constitution. Its ruling struck down a preliminary injunction that had kept the ban on hold, although that ruling has yet to be certified to officially take effect.On Monday the last day for it to do so the ACLU of Indiana filed a petition for a rehearing with the high court asking it to keep the ban on hold while it pursues a narrower preliminary injunction in a trial court to address the scope of the bans exemption allowing women facing serious health risks to obtain abortions. That filing delays the certification of the courts ruling while it considers whether to grant or deny that petition, said court spokesperson Kathryn Dolan. Its unclear how long it may take the high court to decide the matter. But the state attorney generals office, which had 15 days to respond to the rehearing request, filed it Tuesday, urging the court to promptly deny plaintiffs groundless and exceedingly calculated rehearing petition and calling it a transparent attempt to delay certification of the courts ruling. Attorney Generals office spokeswoman Katlyn Milligan said in a statement Tuesday that, On the eve of Indianas pro-life law going into effect, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood made a desperate attempt to prevent Indiana from enforcing our own law. We responded to this filing immediately and are now waiting for the Court to rule.Planned Parenthood ended abortion services at its four clinics Monday in light of the states guidance and the uncertainty over when the court will certify its abortion ban ruling, Gibron said. The reality is that it can happen at any point. The Supreme Court could certify it this afternoon, she said.Gibron said Indianas abortion ban will target Hoosiers of color, indigenous communities and those already marginalized by our health care system.Indianas two other abortion clinics, which are not operated by Planned Parenthood and are both located in Indianapolis, have also stopped providing abortion care. In a statement, Clinic for Women owner LaDonna Prince said the clinic ended abortions on Monday, calling it a dark day for Indiana and for the country.The states other abortion clinic, Womens Med, stopped providing abortions on Friday, a representative said Tuesday.Although Planned Parenthoods Indiana abortion clinics are no longer performing abortions, Gibron said a patient navigation team is working to help patients get out-of-state abortions. That includes helping schedule appointments and finding ways to help them pay the costs of traveling out of state. Adjacent Illinois and Michigan states where abortion remains legal will most likely become the destinations for many Indiana residents seeking out-of-state abortion care, said Gibron, who is CEO for Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky.Planned Parenthood of Illinois had prepared for years for the possibility of Roe v. Wade falling, and it opened clinics near the Indiana and Wisconsin borders in 2018 and 2020 in anticipation of those states restricting access to abortion, said Kristen Schultz, the affiliates chief strategy and operations officer.She said patients from Indiana nearly doubled after the states ban briefly went into effect last September and that traffic is expected to rise again starting this week. Schultz said more doctors, advanced nurse practitioners and medical assistants have been hired to accommodate the expected surge.The demand has increased, the challenges have increased when patients show up at our doors having traveled eight or ten or 12 hours. Thats an increased burden on the patient. And our staff really feel that, she said.Claire Savage, a corps member for the Associated PressReport for America Statehouse News Initiative, contributed to this report.","Indiana’s six abortion clinics have ceased performing abortions as the state’s near-total abortion ban is set to take effect. Planned Parenthood’s four clinics and the state’s other two independent clinics stopped providing abortion services in response to guidance issued by the state, signaling that abortions would become illegal in most cases. The ban, which eliminates nearly all abortions, includes very limited exceptions, such as cases of rape or incest within the first 10 weeks or for health risks to the mother, or fatal fetal abnormalities up to 20 weeks.

Indiana became the first state to enforce stricter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Although the ACLU challenged the ban’s constitutionality, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that it does not violate the state constitution. This ruling has yet to be certified, and the ACLU has filed a petition for a rehearing to delay the ban’s enforcement while further legal proceedings unfold.

In response, Planned Parenthood is assisting patients in seeking abortions in neighboring states like Illinois and Michigan, where abortion remains legal. The state’s other clinics have also halted services, and demand for out-of-state care is expected to rise. The legal battles continue as the state and the ACLU await further court decisions on the ban’s implementation."
"Don‚Äôt call a pro-life midwife, UK university said | Catholic News Agency","Dont call a pro-life midwife, UK university said Catholic News Agency Tuesday, March 19, 2024 A service of EWTN News CNA ACI Prensa ACI Stampa ACI Digital ACI Africa ACI Afrique ACI Mena CNA Deutsche NCRegister News Headlines Vatican Americas Asia - Pacific US Europe Middle East - Africa Most Read Archive Resources Abortion Advent Apologetics Benedict XVI Bible Catechism Catholic Links Church Fathers Holy Week Life Family Liturgical Calendar Liturgy Mary Politics Pope Francis Prayers Sacraments Saints Virtue CNA Newsletter Editors Service About Us Advertise Privacy Donate Search Menu Subscribe EWTN News Dont call a pro-life midwife, UK university said EmiliaUngurShutterstock London, England, Jan 21, 2020 1700 pm An undergraduate student in a midwife program was barred from placement in a hospital, reportedly due to her pro-life beliefs. The decision was overturned last week, but free speech advocates say the case is troubling. According to The Telegraph, Julia Rynkiewicz, a 24-year-old student at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., was blocked from entering her program's hospital placement phase, after the university learned of her pro-life beliefs and her leadership in a pro-life student group. Rynkiewicz underwent a ""fitness to practice"" hearing by the school last Monday. While the university overturned its decision and will allow Rynkiewicz to continue as a midwife student, the investigation and temporary ban from the placement set her back a year in her studies. Concerns were raised by school officials about Rynkiewicz's fitness to practice as a midwife after they saw her tending a booth at a school fair in her position as president for Nottingham Students for Life NSFL, an approved pro-life student group that supports life from conception to natural death. Just days after the fair last September, Rynkiewicz said she received a letter from officials at her Midwifery School saying that a formal complaint had been filed against her due to her pro-life activities. The complaint alleged that she had ""provided reproductive health advice without the support of a registered midwife and.expressed personal beliefs regarding reproductive sexual health in the public domain including the press and social media to the effect that it may create the perception of an impact on patient care,"" The Telegraph reported. ""I think it's important to remember that being pro-life isn't incompatible with being a midwife,"" Rynkiewicz, who is a Catholic, told The Telegraph. The Abortion Act of 1967 in the UK allows for conscientious objection to abortions for healthcare providers. Rynkiewicz said she is concerned about what her case could mean for freedom of speech on university campuses. ""But universities should be a place where we can speak up about your beliefs and debate with people in a civilized way so I'm shocked that this happened,"" she told The Telegraph. Pro-life advocacy and legal groups spoke out on behalf of Rynkiewicz, arguing for her freedom of speech and right to conscientious objection. ""What has happened to Ms. Rynkiewicz is a flagrant violation of her moral and legal right to freedom of expression,"" Mark Bhagwandin, senior education and media officer at pro-life group Life Charity, told The Telegraph. Laurence Wilkinson, legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom International, told The Telegraph that this case ""represents a very chilling prospect for freedom of speech on campus."" ""Despite the allegations being dismissed, the practical effect of this investigation is that Julia is now forced to graduate one year later than her classmates. It is to Julia's credit that she remains absolutely committed to completing her training, caring for women and bringing life into the world,"" he added. ""She is now considering her options, as no student should have to go through this kind of daunting process in the absence of clear and compelling reasons."" Rynkiewicz told The Telegraph that she is demanding an apology from the school, and that she has filed a formal complaint about her case against the school. She added that she is seeking compensation for the stress and inconvenience caused to her, and that she is willing to take her case to court if necessary. ""It all felt a bit ridiculous and I have had to put my life on hold for a year and that's been frustrating. I have been suspended for almost four months as a result of not being able to attend my placement and been forced to take year-long interruption to my studies. I won't be back until September and will now be graduating a year later than I wanted to,"" she told The Telegraph.

I feel fine about it all now but I would still like them to apologize as a matter of justice. I suppose that they have realized they have done wrong and I hope they will change it so no one else has to go through what I have,"" she said. A spokesperson for the University of Nottingham told The Telegraph that it takes fitness to practice investigations seriously, ""to ensure they can provide appropriate and professional advice and care to patients."" The university added that it would be considering ways to help Rynkiewicz reconvene her studies without further delay. ""The student's complaint will be carefully considered while their School is actively considering how they can recommence their studies without delay,"" the school said.

The issue arose after the university learned of her leadership in a pro-life student group and her public advocacy for life from conception. The university raised concerns about her fitness to practice midwifery, citing a complaint that she provided reproductive health advice without a registered midwife’s support and expressed views that could impact patient care. Rynkiewicz, a Catholic, disagreed, stating that being pro-life is compatible with being a midwife, and expressed concerns about free speech on campuses.

Although the university later reversed its decision, allowing her to continue her studies, the investigation delayed her graduation by a year. Pro-life and legal groups supported Rynkiewicz, criticizing the violation of her free speech rights. She filed a formal complaint against the university, seeking an apology and compensation for the stress and disruption caused. The university stated that it takes fitness to practice concerns seriously and is working to help Rynkiewicz resume her studies without further delay."
